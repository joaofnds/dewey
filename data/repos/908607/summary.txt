NumPy is the foundational Python library for scientific computing and numerical analysis, providing a high-performance N-dimensional array object (ndarray) and essential mathematical functions for data science, machine learning, and scientific research. Built with C/Fortran backends for performance, it offers vectorized operations, broadcasting capabilities, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and random number generation. NumPy serves as the base layer for the entire Python scientific computing ecosystem, enabling efficient manipulation of large datasets and numerical computations. It primarily targets data scientists, researchers, engineers, and Python developers working in scientific computing, analytics, and quantitative fields who need fast array operations and mathematical computations beyond standard Python capabilities.
