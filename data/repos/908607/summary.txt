NumPy is the fundamental Python package for scientific computing, providing a high-performance N-dimensional array object and sophisticated broadcasting functions. It offers tools for integrating with C/C++ and Fortran code, alongside linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities. This library enables numerical computation and is designed for use by data scientists, researchers, and engineers involved in scientific and technical computing applications. This is a core dependency for many scientific Python packages.
