Capybara is a Ruby-based acceptance testing framework designed for web application testing that simulates real user interactions through an intuitive DSL. Built for web developers and QA engineers, it provides driver-agnostic testing capabilities with built-in support for Rack::Test and Selenium WebDriver, enabling seamless switching between headless and browser-based test execution. The framework integrates natively with popular Ruby testing frameworks including RSpec, Cucumber, Test::Unit, and Minitest, while offering powerful synchronization features for handling asynchronous JavaScript and AJAX operations. Capybara specifically targets Rails and Rack applications, providing zero-configuration setup for Rails projects and comprehensive DOM interaction methods for form filling, link clicking, element querying, and JavaScript execution, making it essential tooling for behavior-driven development and end-to-end web application testing workflows.
