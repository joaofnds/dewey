Vaultwarden is an unofficial, self-hosted server implementation compatible with the Bitwarden client API, written in Rust, designed to offer a resource-efficient alternative to the official Bitwarden server. This project provides core Bitwarden functionalities, including personal vaults, send features, attachment support, organization features, and multi-factor authentication. It leverages the Rust programming language, is deployable using Docker, and is intended as a standalone application, primarily targeting users interested in self-hosting a password management solution for personal or organizational use.
