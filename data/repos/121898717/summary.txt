Vaultwarden is an unofficial Rust-based server implementation of the Bitwarden Client API, designed for self-hosted password management deployments. Built using the Rocket web framework, it provides a lightweight alternative to the resource-intensive official Bitwarden server while maintaining full compatibility with official Bitwarden clients across platforms. The project targets system administrators and DevOps professionals seeking to deploy password management infrastructure with reduced resource requirements. It implements comprehensive Bitwarden features including personal vaults, organizational password sharing, multi-factor authentication (FIDO2, TOTP, YubiKey), emergency access, and administrative backends. Distributed primarily as Docker containers across multiple registries (ghcr.io, docker.io, quay.io), it serves the cybersecurity and enterprise infrastructure domain by enabling secure, self-hosted credential management solutions without the overhead of the official enterprise stack.
