Evil Collection is an Emacs Lisp package that extends vim-style keybindings to Emacs modes not covered by the base Evil package, which provides vi/vim emulation in Emacs. It addresses the inconsistent keybinding experience across Emacs' special modes like help-mode, calendar, dired, eshell, and others by implementing comprehensive vim-compatible navigation and command mappings. The package targets Emacs power users and vim converts who want consistent hjkl navigation and modal editing paradigms throughout their entire Emacs workflow. It integrates with the Evil framework and provides configurable bindings for dozens of built-in and third-party Emacs modes, solving the context-switching inefficiency that occurs when vim keybindings are unavailable in specialized Emacs interfaces, thereby maintaining muscle memory and editing efficiency across the entire editor ecosystem.
