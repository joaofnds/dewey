Postmon is a Brazilian postal code (CEP) lookup API built with Python that provides comprehensive address and location information for Brazilian addresses. The service targets web developers and backend engineers building applications requiring Brazilian address validation and geographic data integration. Built on a Python stack using Bottle web framework, MongoDB for data storage, and Celery for task scheduling, it serves RESTful endpoints for CEP queries, city/state lookups, and IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) data including municipal codes and territorial areas. The API aggregates data from multiple Brazilian postal and geographic sources, offering endpoints like `/v1/cep/{cep}` and `/cidade/{state}/{city}` to support e-commerce, logistics, and location-based applications requiring accurate Brazilian address resolution and demographic information.
