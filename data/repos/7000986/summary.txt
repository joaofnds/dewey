Postmon is a Python-based API providing Brazilian address and delivery information. It retrieves CEP (postal code) data, including municipal and state information sourced from IBGE, and exposes it through RESTful endpoints. The application utilizes a MongoDB database for data storage, Celery for background task scheduling (specifically data updates), and is deployable via Docker. Key dependencies include the `requests`, `pymongo`, and `bottle` libraries, with a focus on delivering address-related information via a web API.
