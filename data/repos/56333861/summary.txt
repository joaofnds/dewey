Verdaccio is a lightweight, zero-configuration private proxy npm registry designed for Node.js projects. Functionality includes caching downloaded modules from public registries like npmjs.org, providing a local repository for private packages, and enabling the use of community-made plugins for storage and integration. Built with TypeScript and supporting npm, pnpm, and Yarn, Verdaccio facilitates package management, caching, and proxying, making it a developer productivity tool for managing both private and proxied npm packages, deployable via Docker and Helm, and intended for use by Node.js developers and teams.
