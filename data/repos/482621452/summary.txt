Bud is a full-stack web framework for Go developers that automatically generates boilerplate code to integrate backend Go services with modern frontend technologies. The framework targets web application development by combining Go's backend capabilities with JavaScript/TypeScript frontends, supporting server-side rendering (SSR) and Svelte components. It solves the complexity of manually wiring together full-stack Go applications by providing code generation, file-based routing, and development tooling that mimics modern JavaScript frameworks like Next.js. Bud requires Go 1.17+ and Node.js 14+, offering a single binary CLI tool for project scaffolding, development server management, and production builds. The framework primarily serves Go developers seeking rapid full-stack web development without extensive manual configuration of frontend-backend integration layers.
