Snapdrop is a Progressive Web App (PWA) enabling local file sharing directly within a web browser, inspired by Apple's AirDrop. It facilitates file transfer between devices on the same network using WebRTC and WebSockets, providing a peer-to-peer file sharing solution. The application utilizes a frontend built with vanilla HTML5, ES6, and CSS3, coupled with a NodeJS backend, and is designed for ease of use across various devices. This is a standalone web application.
