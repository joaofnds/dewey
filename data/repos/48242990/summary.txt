Snapdrop is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that enables peer-to-peer file sharing between devices on the same local network through web browsers, eliminating the need for native applications or cloud services. Built with vanilla JavaScript (HTML5/ES6/CSS3) frontend and Node.js backend, it leverages WebRTC for direct device-to-device communication and WebSockets for signaling and device discovery. The application addresses the cross-platform file transfer problem by providing an AirDrop-like experience that works across different operating systems and device types through standard web technologies. Target users include developers, IT administrators, and end-users who need quick, secure local file sharing without installing additional software or relying on internet connectivity for transfers within their network environment.
