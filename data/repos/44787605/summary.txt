coverage.el is an Emacs Lisp package that generates and visualizes code coverage profiles directly within GNU Emacs buffers through syntax highlighting overlays. Targeting software developers in the DevOps and testing domain, it integrates with multiple coverage analysis tools including Go coverage profiles, gcov (GNU Coverage), and lcov (Linux Test Project coverage) to provide in-editor visualization of test coverage data. The package solves the workflow friction of context-switching between code editors and external coverage reporting tools by embedding coverage metrics directly into the development environment. Designed for Emacs-using developers working with C/C++ and Go codebases, it supports extensible architecture for adding new language coverage formats, requiring GNU Emacs 24.3+ and enabling real-time coverage feedback during development and testing workflows.
