Jumppad is a Go-based infrastructure-as-code tool designed for DevOps and cloud-native development workflows, enabling developers and system administrators to programmatically define and manage local development environments using HCL configuration syntax. It provides higher-level abstractions than Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container applications, Kubernetes clusters (k3s), Nomad clusters, and container networking with automatic dependency management and health checking. The tool targets cloud-native developers who need reproducible, complex local environments that mirror production infrastructure, supporting Docker and Podman container runtimes, Helm chart deployments, ingress configuration, and service discovery. Unlike Terraform's focus on cloud infrastructure provisioning, Jumppad specifically addresses the challenge of creating consistent, shareable development environments and interactive documentation for cloud-native applications and microservices architectures.
