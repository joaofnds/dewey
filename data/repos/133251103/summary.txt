**dive** is a command-line Docker image analysis tool written in Go that provides deep inspection capabilities for container images and their filesystem layers. Targeting DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and Docker developers, it offers a terminal-based user interface (TUI) for exploring layer-by-layer contents, tracking file changes across layers, and identifying inefficiencies like duplicate files or incomplete deletions that contribute to bloated image sizes. The tool integrates with Docker Engine, Podman, and Docker archives, supports CI/CD pipeline integration for automated image optimization validation, and includes build-and-analyze workflows. It addresses the critical container optimization problem by providing visibility into layer composition and space utilization, enabling developers to reduce image sizes, improve deployment speeds, and optimize container storage costs through data-driven layer analysis and waste detection.
