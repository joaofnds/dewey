`dive` is a Go-based, command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for exploring and analyzing the layers of Docker and OCI container images. It allows users to inspect image contents, visualize changes across layers, and estimate image efficiency by identifying wasted space. Functionality includes file tree navigation, change highlighting (added, removed, modified files), CI/CD integration for automated image quality checks based on efficiency metrics, and support for various container engines (Docker, Podman). The project is a standalone application focused on developer productivity, targeting users involved in building and optimizing Docker images.
