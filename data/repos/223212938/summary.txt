This is a Java-based educational repository from Alura focused on Apache Kafka fundamentals and microservices architecture implementation. The codebase demonstrates event-driven communication patterns, message streaming, and distributed system design using Kafka as the central message broker. It targets backend developers and software architects learning to build scalable microservices that communicate asynchronously through Kafka topics, producers, and consumers. The repository likely includes practical examples of service decoupling, event sourcing, and real-time data processing workflows common in enterprise Java applications. This educational material addresses the challenge of building resilient, loosely-coupled distributed systems where services need to communicate reliably at scale without direct synchronous dependencies.
