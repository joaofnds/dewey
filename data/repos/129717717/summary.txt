Loki is a horizontally-scalable, multi-tenant log aggregation system written in Go that serves as a cloud-native logging solution for DevOps and observability workflows. Inspired by Prometheus, it stores compressed, unstructured logs while indexing only metadata labels rather than full-text content, making it cost-effective for large-scale deployments. The system integrates seamlessly with the Grafana ecosystem, using Prometheus-style labels for correlation between metrics and logs, and is optimized for Kubernetes environments with automatic Pod metadata indexing. Loki addresses the challenge of efficient log storage and querying in distributed systems, targeting site reliability engineers, DevOps teams, and platform engineers who need scalable log management without the overhead of traditional full-text indexing solutions like Elasticsearch.
