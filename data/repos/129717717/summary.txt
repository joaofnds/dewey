Loki is a horizontally-scalable, cloud-native log aggregation system, mirroring Prometheus's architecture but designed for log data. Written in Go, it stores and indexes log streams using labels, enabling efficient querying and cost-effective operation by avoiding full-text indexing. Key features include integration with Grafana for visualization, seamless switching between metrics and logs using shared labels, and suitability for Kubernetes environments. This standalone application comprises a core Loki service, an agent (Alloy), and integrates with Grafana, targeting system administrators and DevOps engineers managing cloud-native applications.
