leap.nvim is a Neovim motion plugin written in Fennel that provides rapid cursor navigation within the visible editor area using 2-character search patterns and predictive label overlays. Targeting modal text editor users and vim/neovim developers, it implements an enhanced alternative to vim-sneak that minimizes keystrokes for jumping to any screen position through a streamlined search-and-label interface. The plugin leverages Neovim's Lua API and treesitter integration for advanced features like remote operations and incremental node selection, solving the inefficiency of traditional vim motions for long-distance cursor movement. It includes experimental functionality for performing operations at remote locations and automatic text object manipulation, primarily serving developers who prioritize keyboard-driven text editing efficiency in code editors.
