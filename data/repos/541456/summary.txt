Python Koans is an interactive Test-Driven Development (TDD) tutorial framework designed for Python programming education. It implements a series of failing unit tests that learners progressively fix by filling in missing assertions and implementing code logic, covering core Python concepts from basic syntax to advanced features. The repository contains structured test files using Python's unittest framework, organized as incremental exercises that teach language fundamentals through hands-on practice. It supports Python 3.x environments and includes optional sniffer integration for continuous test execution. The framework is targeted at beginner to intermediate Python developers seeking to learn language features through practical TDD methodology, providing an alternative to traditional documentation-based learning by requiring active problem-solving and test completion to advance through the curriculum.
