`node-cron` is a TypeScript library providing a cron-based job scheduler for Node.js applications. It enables the execution of functions or external commands according to time-based schedules defined using standard or enhanced cron syntax, including second-level precision. Key functionalities include executing jobs via callbacks or child processes, supporting time zones and UTC offsets, and offering a `CronJob` class with methods for job management. This library is primarily a developer tool, aimed at Node.js developers needing to automate tasks such as data backups and notifications.
