oil.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides a buffer-based file explorer for the Neovim text editor ecosystem. Targeting software developers and power users who work within terminal-based development environments, it reimagines filesystem navigation by treating directories as editable buffers rather than traditional tree-view explorers. The plugin integrates with Neovim's native buffer system, LSP file operations, and icon providers like nvim-web-devicons, allowing users to perform file operations (create, delete, rename, move) using standard Vim editing commands and motions. It solves the inefficiency of context switching between file managers and editors by enabling direct filesystem manipulation within the editor interface, supporting features like trash integration, filesystem watching, floating windows, and customizable column displays for file metadata, making it particularly valuable for developers who prefer keyboard-driven workflows.
