Topgrade is a Rust-based system automation tool designed for DevOps and system administration workflows that consolidates package manager updates across heterogeneous environments. The tool automatically detects installed package managers, development tools, and system utilities on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems, then executes appropriate update commands for each detected tool in a single operation. It supports remote execution via SSH for managing multiple hosts, uses TOML-based configuration for customization, and targets system administrators and developers who need to maintain up-to-date software across diverse toolchains including Homebrew, APT, Cargo, npm, and other package managers. The project addresses the complexity of managing updates across multiple package ecosystems by providing a unified interface that eliminates the need for custom shell scripts or manual update processes.
