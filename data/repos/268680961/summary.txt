Pigsty is a comprehensive PostgreSQL distribution and infrastructure automation platform designed for database administrators and DevOps engineers who need to deploy and manage production-ready PostgreSQL clusters. Built primarily with Shell scripts and Ansible playbooks, it provides a battery-included PostgreSQL-as-a-Service solution that includes high availability clustering via Patroni, connection pooling with PgBouncer, backup management through PgBackrest, load balancing with HAProxy, and comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. The platform supports 414 PostgreSQL extensions across multiple kernel variants, offers automated installation and configuration, and includes additional modules for Redis, MinIO, and other infrastructure components. Pigsty targets organizations seeking to self-host PostgreSQL with enterprise-grade reliability while avoiding cloud RDS costs, providing Infrastructure-as-Code capabilities for bare-metal and virtual machine deployments across RHEL, Debian, and Ubuntu distributions.
