i18n-node is a lightweight internationalization (i18n) library for Node.js web applications that provides dynamic translation functionality with JSON-based language file storage. Designed for web developers building multilingual Node.js applications, it integrates seamlessly with Express.js and other frameworks through middleware patterns, using the standard `__('...')` translation syntax. The module automatically detects user locale from browser Accept-Language headers, stores translations in WebTranslateIt-compatible JSON files, and dynamically adds new translation strings at runtime. It supports both singleton and instance-based configurations, enabling developers to implement localization in server-side JavaScript applications without complex parsing or preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for rapid development of internationalized web services and APIs.
