This TypeScript library provides a utility for generating Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers (ULIDs), offering an alternative to UUIDs. Key features include lexicographical sortability for efficient database indexing, a compact 26-character string representation, and monotonic ULID generation to prevent sort order issues within the same millisecond. The library supports both ESM and CommonJS module formats and offers functionalities for generating, validating, and extracting the timestamp from ULIDs, alongside CLI capabilities. Primarily, it is a developer productivity tool targeting developers working with JavaScript and TypeScript who require unique, sortable identifiers, particularly for applications such as backend data management.
