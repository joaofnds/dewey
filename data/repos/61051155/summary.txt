This TypeScript library implements ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier) generation for JavaScript/Node.js environments, targeting web developers and backend engineers who need better alternatives to UUIDs for database keys and distributed system identifiers. The library provides lexicographically sortable 128-bit identifiers encoded as 26-character strings using Crockford's base32, offering monotonic ordering within milliseconds and cryptographically-secure random number generation via Web Crypto API and Node.js crypto module. It solves database fragmentation and sorting issues common with UUID v4 by combining timestamp-based prefixes with random suffixes, making it ideal for time-series data, distributed databases, and systems requiring both uniqueness and natural sort order without sacrificing URL-safety or case-insensitive compatibility.
