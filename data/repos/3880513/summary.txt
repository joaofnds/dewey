Johnny-Five is a JavaScript robotics and IoT programming framework that provides hardware abstraction APIs for controlling microcontrollers and single-board computers through the Firmata protocol. It enables JavaScript developers to program Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, Intel Edison, and other embedded platforms using familiar Node.js syntax. The framework abstracts low-level hardware interfaces including GPIO, PWM, I2C, SPI, ADC, DAC, and 1-wire protocols into composable JavaScript objects for sensors, actuators, motors, and other electronic components. Targeting web developers entering the IoT/robotics domain, Johnny-Five integrates with Express.js, Socket.io, and other Node.js libraries to build connected hardware projects, educational robotics applications, and IoT prototypes without requiring embedded C programming knowledge.
