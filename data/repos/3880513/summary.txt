Johnny-Five is a JavaScript robotics and IoT programming framework built on the Firmata Protocol, enabling JavaScript-based control of hardware platforms like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and others. It provides a high-level, composable API for interacting with various electronic components, including LEDs, servos, motors, sensors, and more, abstracting away low-level hardware details. The framework supports a wide range of hardware platforms through its IO Plugins and offers extensive examples, API documentation, and community resources. This open-source library aims to provide a baseline control kit for hardware projects, facilitating creativity and experimentation in the robotics and IoT domains by leveraging JavaScript.
