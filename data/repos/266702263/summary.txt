Rough Notation is a lightweight TypeScript library (3.83kb gzipped) for web developers to create and animate hand-drawn style annotations on HTML elements. Built on RoughJS, it targets frontend web development by providing programmatic annotation capabilities including underlines, boxes, circles, highlights, strike-throughs, and brackets with customizable styling and animation properties. The library solves the problem of adding visually appealing, sketch-like annotations to web content for educational platforms, documentation sites, and interactive presentations. It offers both individual annotation control and grouped animation sequencing through a simple JavaScript API, supporting configuration options for colors, stroke width, padding, animation duration, and multi-line text handling. Frontend developers and UI/UX designers use it to enhance user engagement and draw attention to specific content elements.
