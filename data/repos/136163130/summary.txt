Flagsmith is an open-source feature flag and remote configuration management platform built with Python 3, Django 4, and DjangoRestFramework 3, targeting DevOps and web development teams. The system enables developers to dynamically toggle application features, manage remote configurations, and conduct A/B testing without code deployments through a REST API backend and React-based administrative dashboard. It addresses continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) challenges by providing granular feature control across web, mobile, and server-side applications with user segmentation capabilities. The platform supports both self-hosted and SaaS deployment models using Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud infrastructure, serving software engineering teams who need runtime feature management and experimentation frameworks for production applications.
