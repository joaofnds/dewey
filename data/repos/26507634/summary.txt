Paxedit is an Emacs Lisp extension that provides context-aware editing and refactoring capabilities for LISP dialects including Emacs Lisp and Clojure. It automates common code manipulation tasks by intelligently detecting whether the cursor is positioned within symbols, S-expressions, or comments, then applying appropriate operations like deletion, transposition, and enclosure without requiring manual whitespace cleanup or parentheses balancing. The tool handles both explicit expressions (those enclosed in parentheses/brackets) and implicit expressions (like Clojure map key-value pairs or let bindings), allowing developers to manipulate logically-grouped code elements as single units. Paxedit targets LISP developers working in Emacs who frequently refactor symbolic expressions and want to eliminate the tedious manual steps typically required for maintaining proper code structure, indentation, and balanced parentheses during editing operations.
