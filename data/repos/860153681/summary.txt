This repository implements a custom status line plugin for Neovim, the modern Vim-based text editor, written entirely in Lua. The plugin targets software developers and power users who require enhanced editor customization beyond Neovim's default status line functionality. It operates within the developer tools and text editor ecosystem, specifically addressing the need for personalized status bar information display including file details, Git status, LSP diagnostics, and editor modes. The plugin leverages Neovim's Lua API for configuration and rendering, competing with existing status line solutions like lualine.nvim or airline.vim. This tool solves the problem of limited built-in status line customization by providing developers with a lightweight, configurable alternative for displaying relevant coding session information within their Neovim environment.
