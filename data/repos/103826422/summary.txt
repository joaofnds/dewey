PaperWM is a GNOME Shell extension implemented in JavaScript that provides a tiling window manager with scrollable window organization for Linux desktop environments. Targeting system administrators, power users, and developers who require efficient window management, it replaces GNOME's default window behavior with a paper notebook-inspired horizontal scrolling layout where windows are automatically tiled and can be navigated via keyboard shortcuts, mouse interactions, and touchpad gestures. The extension integrates deeply with GNOME Shell's compositor and workspace system, supporting per-monitor workspaces and maintaining compatibility with current GNOME versions (45-46). It addresses the productivity needs of users who prefer tiling window managers but want to remain within the GNOME desktop ecosystem rather than switching to standalone tiling window managers like i3 or dwm.
