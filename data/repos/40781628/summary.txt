**alex** is a JavaScript-based writing linter designed for content creators, technical writers, and developers to automatically detect insensitive and inconsiderate language in text. Built on the retext natural language processing ecosystem, it analyzes plain text, Markdown, HTML, and MDX files to identify problematic phrasing including gendered language, ableist terms, condescending expressions, and profanities, while suggesting inclusive alternatives. The tool operates as both a CLI application and programmatic API, integrating with development workflows through editor plugins (VSCode, Sublime, Vim), build tools (Gulp), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), and version control systems. Targeting the technical writing and documentation domain, alex helps maintain inclusive communication standards in codebases, documentation, and content management systems, serving developers, technical writers, and content teams who prioritize accessible and considerate language in their written materials.
