Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side JavaScript execution outside web browsers. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, it targets web developers and backend engineers for building scalable network applications, APIs, microservices, and server-side solutions. The runtime implements an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model optimized for data-intensive real-time applications across distributed systems. Node.js serves the web development ecosystem by unifying frontend and backend development under a single language, enabling full-stack JavaScript development. It follows semantic versioning with Current and LTS release cycles, providing stability for enterprise applications while supporting rapid development iteration for modern web services and cloud-native applications.
