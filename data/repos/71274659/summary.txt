This repository provides a comprehensive collection of sample applications demonstrating Cloud Functions for Firebase implementation patterns across Node.js (1st and 2nd generation) and Python runtimes. Targeting web and mobile developers building serverless applications on Google Cloud Platform, it showcases event-driven function triggers for Firestore, Realtime Database, Firebase Auth, Cloud Storage, HTTPS requests, and Pub/Sub messaging. The samples cover common use cases including data transformation, image processing, user authentication workflows, email automation, and API endpoints. Each example demonstrates specific Firebase integration patterns like database event handling, file upload processing, and callable functions, serving as practical templates for developers implementing serverless backend functionality in Firebase-based applications using JavaScript and Python within the Function-as-a-Service paradigm.
