This Ruby library provides JSON Schema validation capabilities for web developers and backend engineers working with JSON data interchange. It implements a comprehensive validator that supports JSON Schema specifications from Draft 1 through Draft 6, with Draft 4 as the default. The library offers three validation methods: boolean validation, exception-throwing validation, and detailed error reporting through fully_validate. It handles Ruby objects, JSON strings, and JSON files as input, making it suitable for API development, configuration validation, and data processing pipelines. Key features include custom schema resolution, fragment validation, schema caching, and extensible validation rules. The library is distributed as a RubyGem and maintained by Vox Pupuli, targeting Ruby developers who need reliable JSON data validation against predefined schemas in web applications, microservices, and data transformation workflows.
