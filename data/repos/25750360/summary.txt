QURI is a high-performance URI parsing and manipulation library for Common Lisp applications, designed as a replacement for the legacy PURI library. It implements RFC 3986 standards for handling URIs, URLs, and URNs with full support for UTF-8 characters, IPv6 hostnames, userinfo components, and various URI schemes (HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, LDAP). The library provides comprehensive URL encoding/decoding utilities, query parameter manipulation, and low-level parsing functions optimized for speedâ€”benchmarks show 6.6x faster URI parsing and 3-4x faster URL encoding/decoding compared to existing solutions. Target users include Common Lisp developers building web applications, HTTP clients, API integrations, and any system requiring robust URI handling with performance optimization in web development and network programming domains.
