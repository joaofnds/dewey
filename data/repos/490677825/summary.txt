Orama is a TypeScript-based search engine library that provides full-text, vector, and hybrid search capabilities for JavaScript applications running in browsers, Node.js servers, or edge networks. It implements advanced search algorithms including BM25, typo tolerance, stemming across 30 languages, and vector similarity search with configurable embedding dimensions. The library supports complex data structures with 10 data types including geopoints and arrays, offers features like faceted search, geosearch, and field boosting, and integrates with AI models through plugins for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines and ChatGPT-like experiences. Designed for web developers and search engineers, Orama solves the problem of implementing sophisticated search functionality without heavy external dependencies, delivering enterprise-grade search features in an ultra-lightweight 2kb package that can be deployed across any JavaScript runtime environment.
