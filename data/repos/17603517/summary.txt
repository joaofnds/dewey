SLY is a Common Lisp IDE extension for Emacs that provides interactive development environment capabilities for Lisp programming. It serves the functional programming and systems development domain by offering a full-featured REPL, live code annotations called "stickers" for runtime value inspection, flexible completion using Emacs's native completion API, interactive debugging and tracing tools, and integration with ASDF build system. As a fork of SLIME, it maintains compatibility with existing Common Lisp workflows while enhancing user experience through improved backreferences, multiple REPL support, and seamless integration with Emacs completion frameworks like Company and Helm. The system targets Common Lisp developers and functional programming practitioners who require sophisticated interactive development tools for exploring, debugging, and iterating on Lisp code within the Emacs ecosystem.
