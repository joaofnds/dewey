`sly` is an Emacs-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed specifically for Common Lisp development. As a fork of SLIME, it provides a full-featured REPL integrated with Emacs's `comint.el`, supporting features like code completion, interactive tracing, and live code annotations ("stickers"). Key functionalities include built-in support for company-style completion, backreferences in the REPL, and ASDF integration for easy project loading. This is a plugin/extension for Emacs, targeting Common Lisp developers seeking an improved IDE experience.
