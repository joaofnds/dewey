re-frame is a ClojureScript framework designed for building user interfaces, specifically targeting Single-Page Applications. It leverages React (via Reagent) for the view layer but employs a data-oriented, functional architecture, with a focus on developer productivity and scalability. Key features include an event-driven model where events are causal, and views are purely reactive, offering an alternative to more common approaches. As a framework, it provides tools and structure for building complex web applications within the ClojureScript ecosystem.
