re-frame is a ClojureScript framework for building Single-Page Applications (SPAs) and user interfaces, targeting web developers working on large-scale frontend applications. Built on React through Reagent, it implements a functional, data-oriented architecture where events are causal and views are purely reactive, contrasting with typical React patterns of colocated queries and component lifecycle hooks. The framework addresses the challenge of maintaining high programmer productivity and managing complexity in large JavaScript applications (40K+ lines of code) while avoiding the technical churn common in the JavaScript ecosystem. It leverages ClojureScript's Lisp foundation to provide a stable, mature solution for frontend developers seeking an alternative to traditional MVC patterns, particularly those building complex web applications requiring long-term maintainability and scalability.
