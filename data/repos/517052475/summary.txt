`catp` is a standalone command-line application written in Rust designed to print the standard output of a running process. Utilizing the `ptrace` system call, it intercepts and extracts data from `write` syscalls, allowing users to view output that may have been redirected or otherwise inaccessible. The application provides a solution for debugging and monitoring processes on x86_64 Linux systems by capturing their standard output stream. It is distributed as pre-compiled binaries, with versions for `gnu` and `musl` libc environments.
