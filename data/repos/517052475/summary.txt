`catp` is a Rust-based system administration tool that enables real-time monitoring of stdout/stderr output from already running processes on Linux x86_64 systems. Targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators, it solves the common problem of needing to inspect output from processes that were started without proper logging or were redirected to `/dev/null`. The tool leverages low-level Linux `ptrace` system calls to intercept and extract data from `write` syscalls, requiring root privileges to attach to target processes. This utility is particularly valuable in production environments where restarting long-running processes to enable logging is impractical, providing a non-intrusive method to debug and monitor process behavior without process modification or restart.
