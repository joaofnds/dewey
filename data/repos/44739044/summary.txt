`go-git` is a pure Go library implementing a Git client for manipulating Git repositories programmatically. It provides low-level (plumbing) and high-level (porcelain) APIs, enabling interaction with Git repositories via an idiomatic Go interface. The library supports various storage implementations and mirrors core Git functionalities, including cloning and log retrieval. As a Go library, it targets Go developers seeking to integrate Git functionality within their applications or build custom Git tools.
