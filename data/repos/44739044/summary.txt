go-git is a pure Go implementation of Git version control system functionality, providing both low-level (plumbing) and high-level (porcelain) APIs for programmatic Git repository manipulation. Designed for the DevOps and developer tooling domain, it enables Go developers to build applications that can clone, commit, branch, merge, and perform other Git operations without depending on external Git binaries. The library supports multiple storage backends including in-memory filesystems and custom implementations through its Storer interface, making it suitable for building Git servers, automated deployment tools, code analysis platforms, and other Git-integrated applications. It targets Go developers and DevOps engineers who need to embed Git functionality directly into their applications, with production usage by companies like source{d} and Keybase for building Git-based services and tools.
