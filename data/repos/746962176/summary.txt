Retina is an eBPF-based network observability platform specifically designed for Kubernetes cluster monitoring and troubleshooting. Built in Go, it targets DevOps engineers, cluster network administrators, and security professionals who need deep visibility into containerized network traffic and performance. The tool leverages eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to collect real-time telemetry data including packet flows, DNS queries, drop reasons, and network forwarding metrics without requiring kernel modifications. It provides both continuous monitoring through Prometheus metrics integration and on-demand packet capture capabilities via CLI or Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Retina addresses the challenge of debugging complex microservices networking issues in cloud-native environments by providing actionable insights into application connectivity, network health, and security events across multi-node Kubernetes clusters running on Linux and Windows systems.
