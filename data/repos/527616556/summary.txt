Hubot Sans is a variable font designed by GitHub, intended for use in web applications. It provides a geometric and technical aesthetic, optimized for headers and pull-quotes. The project implements a variable font, enabling a single file to contain multiple font variations (weight and stretch), and includes usage examples for CSS `@font-face` definitions and CLS optimization. It is a standalone font project targeting frontend developers and web designers, distributed under the SIL Open Font License v1.1.
