Hubot Sans is a variable font repository designed for web typography, serving as a geometric companion to GitHub's Mona Sans typeface. Built for web developers and UI/UX designers, it provides a single WOFF2 file containing multiple font weights (200-900) and width variations (75%-125%) optimized for technical documentation, headers, and interface elements. The repository includes CSS implementation examples using @font-face declarations with variable font properties, preloading strategies for Cumulative Layout Shift optimization, and comprehensive style specifications for both regular and italic variants. Licensed under SIL Open Font License, it addresses the need for a technical, geometric typeface in web development workflows while leveraging modern variable font technology for reduced file sizes and improved performance.
