Woodpecker is an open-source CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) engine built in Go, designed for DevOps automation workflows. It provides a lightweight alternative to traditional CI/CD platforms, requiring minimal resources (100MB RAM for server, 30MB for agent) while supporting Docker containerization and Kubernetes orchestration. The system uses a server-agent architecture with SQLite as the default database and extends functionality through a plugin ecosystem. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and development teams, Woodpecker solves the need for scalable, self-hosted CI/CD pipelines with support for multiple Git hosting platforms including integration with privacy-focused platforms like Codeberg, offering pipeline automation for code testing, building, and deployment processes.
