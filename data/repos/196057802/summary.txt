LogiOps is an unofficial userspace driver for Logitech HID++ 2.0+ devices, targeting Linux system administrators and power users who need advanced configuration capabilities for Logitech mice and keyboards. Built in C++20, it operates as a systemd daemon that interfaces with the Linux HID subsystem using libevdev, libudev, and glib to provide custom button mapping, gesture control, and device configuration beyond standard Linux drivers. The driver specifically addresses the gap in Linux support for advanced Logitech device features like the MX Master series, enabling users to configure DPI settings, custom button actions, and scroll wheel behavior through a configuration file-based approach, eliminating dependence on Logitech's proprietary Windows/macOS software.
