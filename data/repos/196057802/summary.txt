`logiops` is an unofficial userspace driver written in C++ for Logitech HID++ devices on Linux systems, enabling configuration and control of Logitech mice and keyboards. It provides functionality for customizing device behavior, leveraging the HID++ protocol (v2.0+). The project is a standalone application requiring dependencies such as `libevdev`, `libudev`, `glib`, and `libconfig`. Users interact with the application via a command-line interface (CLI), and the project is designed for users of Logitech peripherals on Linux systems.
