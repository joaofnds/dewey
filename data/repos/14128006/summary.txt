This repository provides a production-ready Go implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm for building distributed systems. Targeting backend developers and infrastructure engineers, it enables construction of replicated state machines and fault-tolerant distributed applications by managing replicated logs and ensuring consistency across cluster nodes. The library implements the complete Raft protocol including leader election, log replication, and cluster membership changes, with pluggable storage backends like MDBStore and BoltDB for persistence. It serves as a foundational component for distributed databases, configuration management systems, and other CP (Consistent, Partition-tolerant) distributed systems where strong consistency guarantees are required, making it particularly valuable for DevOps infrastructure and distributed system architectures.
