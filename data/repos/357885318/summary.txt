Datree is a CLI-based policy enforcement tool for Kubernetes, designed to prevent misconfigurations from reaching production environments. Written in Go, it scans Kubernetes resource definitions against a comprehensive set of over 100 built-in rules covering security, best practices, and operational concerns, and allows users to define custom rules using JSON Schema or Rego. This standalone application allows users to validate Kubernetes configurations pre-deployment. Although the project is deprecated, it offered an admission webhook integration, along with policy management features.
