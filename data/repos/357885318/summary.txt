Datree is a deprecated Kubernetes policy enforcement tool built in Go that prevents misconfigured resources from reaching production environments. The tool serves the DevOps and cloud-native domain by providing end-to-end policy management through CLI-based static code analysis and admission webhook integration. It scanned Kubernetes YAML configurations against centralized policies with over 100 built-in rules covering security, high availability, and compliance standards, plus support for custom rules written in JSON Schema or Rego. Datree targeted DevOps engineers, platform teams, and Kubernetes administrators who needed automated guardrails for container orchestration deployments, offering both standalone offline mode and centralized policy registry capabilities before its commercial backing ceased in July 2023.
