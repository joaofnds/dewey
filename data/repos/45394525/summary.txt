`eslint-config-google` provides a shareable ESLint configuration for enforcing the Google JavaScript style guide (ES2015+). This JavaScript library defines a set of ESLint rules that align with Google's coding style, allowing developers to automatically check and enforce code style consistency within their projects. It functions as a configuration package intended for integration into JavaScript projects using ESLint, a popular JavaScript linter and code quality tool. Developers leverage it by extending their ESLint configuration files to apply the defined style rules.
