This repository provides an ESLint shareable configuration that implements Google's JavaScript style guide (ES2015+ version) for code linting and formatting enforcement. Targeting web development teams and JavaScript developers, it encapsulates Google's coding standards into a reusable ESLint configuration package that can be installed via npm and integrated into JavaScript projects. The configuration defines specific linting rules covering syntax, formatting, and best practices aligned with Google's internal JavaScript conventions. Developers can extend this config in their .eslintrc files, optionally combining it with eslint:recommended rules, to automatically enforce consistent code style across their codebase. This solves the problem of maintaining uniform code quality and style consistency in JavaScript projects by providing a battle-tested, enterprise-grade ruleset from Google's engineering practices.
