RedisInsight is a cross-platform GUI application for Redis database management and development, built with TypeScript using Electron, Monaco Editor, and Node.js. Targeting database administrators, backend developers, and DevOps engineers, it provides comprehensive Redis database interaction capabilities including CRUD operations for all Redis data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, streams), JSON document management, real-time command profiling, pub/sub messaging, and performance optimization recommendations. The application supports Redis modules like RedisJSON, RedisSearch, and RedisTimeSeries, features an advanced command-line workbench with auto-completion, slowlog analysis, bulk operations, and extensible plugin architecture. It addresses the need for visual Redis database management across Redis OSS, Redis Cloud, and Azure Cache for Redis deployments.
