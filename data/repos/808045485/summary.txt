Ladybird is a pre-alpha, independent web browser built using C++ with a focus on web standards compliance. It employs a multi-process architecture, including separate processes for the UI, WebContent rendering, image decoding, and network requests, to enhance security and robustness. Leveraging components from SerenityOS such as LibWeb, LibJS, LibWasm, and others, the project aims to deliver a complete and usable modern web browsing experience. Ladybird is a standalone GUI application.
