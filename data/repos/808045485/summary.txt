Ladybird is an independent web browser implementation built from scratch in C++ for web browsing and browser engine development. The project targets web developers, browser engineers, and systems programmers interested in browser architecture and web standards implementation. It features a multi-process architecture with separate processes for UI, WebContent rendering, ImageDecoder, and RequestServer, utilizing custom-built libraries including LibWeb (rendering engine), LibJS (JavaScript engine), LibWasm (WebAssembly), LibTLS/LibCrypto (security), and LibHTTP (networking protocols). The browser addresses the need for platform-independent web browsing software by implementing core web standards and protocols natively, providing sandboxed tab isolation and out-of-process image decoding for security against malicious content across Linux, macOS, Windows, and Unix-like systems.
