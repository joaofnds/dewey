Typesense is an open-source, C++-based search engine designed as an alternative to Algolia, Pinecone, and ElasticSearch for web developers and search engineers building search-driven applications. It provides an in-memory, typo-tolerant full-text search engine with sub-50ms query latency, supporting fuzzy search, faceting, geo-search, vector embeddings, and semantic search capabilities. The system targets e-commerce, content discovery, and enterprise search use cases, offering REST APIs for indexing and querying structured data with features like real-time indexing, federated search across multiple collections, and integration with machine learning models for similarity and hybrid search. Developers use it to implement instant search experiences, product catalogs, content management systems, and recommendation engines without the complexity of ElasticSearch or costs of hosted solutions.
