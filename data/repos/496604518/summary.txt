`flagd` is a feature flag daemon, a standalone application designed to manage feature flags and provide a backend system compliant with the OpenFeature standard. Built in Go, it supports near real-time flag updates from multiple data sources and offers a flexible rule targeting engine with deterministic percentage-based rollouts. Functionality includes exposing flag evaluation traces and metrics compatible with OpenTelemetry. The project is a standalone application, providing HTTP(s) and gRPC endpoints for flag evaluation, and integrates with applications through OpenFeature providers.
