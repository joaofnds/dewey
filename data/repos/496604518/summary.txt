flagd is a feature flag daemon built in Go that provides a standalone, OpenFeature-compliant backend system for managing feature flags in software development environments. It serves the DevOps and application development domain by offering real-time flag evaluation through HTTP and gRPC APIs, supporting multiple concurrent data sources (files, remote endpoints) with automatic synchronization. The system includes a rule-based targeting engine for conditional feature rollouts, deterministic percentage-based distribution, and OpenTelemetry integration for observability. Designed with Unix philosophy principles, flagd targets software engineers, DevOps teams, and system administrators who need centralized feature flag management without vendor lock-in, enabling controlled feature releases, A/B testing, and configuration management across polyglot application architectures through OpenFeature SDK providers.
