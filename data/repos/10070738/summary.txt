**Lisp Koans** is an interactive Common Lisp language learning framework designed for software developers seeking to master functional programming concepts. The repository implements a test-driven learning methodology using broken unit tests that learners progressively fix, covering core Common Lisp features including assertions, data structures, control flow, macros, and concurrent programming with bordeaux-threads. The system provides automated feedback through file watchers on Linux/MacOS and supports multiple Common Lisp implementations (SBCL, CLISP, CCL, ABCL, ECL). Following the established koans pattern from Ruby and Python ecosystems, it addresses the educational gap in functional programming by providing hands-on practice with Lisp-specific features like symbolic computation and macro systems, targeting developers transitioning from imperative to functional programming paradigms.
