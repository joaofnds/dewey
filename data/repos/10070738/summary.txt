`google/lisp-koans` is a Common Lisp project designed as a language learning exercise, emulating the structure of "koans" found in projects like the Ruby and Python Koans. It presents a series of broken unit tests, guiding learners through Common Lisp features by requiring them to complete assertions to achieve test passage. Key functionality includes a testing framework utilizing `define-test` and `assert-*` macros for interactive exploration of the language, alongside scripts for automated test execution and continuous feedback. The project is a standalone learning tool primarily leveraging the Common Lisp programming language and potentially utilizing libraries like `bordeaux-threads` and the Quicklisp package manager for more advanced topics like threading, targeting individuals seeking to learn or improve their Common Lisp programming skills.
