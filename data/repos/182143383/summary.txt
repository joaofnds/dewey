sshcode is a deprecated Go-based CLI tool that automated the deployment and execution of code-server (VS Code in the browser) on remote Linux servers via SSH connections. Targeted at software developers and DevOps engineers, it solved the problem of seamlessly accessing remote development environments by automatically uploading local VS Code extensions and settings to remote servers, then launching a browser-based IDE instance. The tool utilized SSH for secure connections, rsync for file synchronization, and Chrome's app mode for a native-like coding experience. It supported Linux, macOS, and WSL clients connecting to x86_64 Linux servers with glibc, providing features like bidirectional settings sync and custom VS Code variant support (including VS Code Insiders). The project has been superseded by the official code-server installation script.
