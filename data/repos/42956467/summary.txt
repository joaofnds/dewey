This repository serves as a curated collection of macOS command-line tools, utilities, and shell commands designed to enhance terminal productivity for Mac users. Targeting system administrators, developers, and power users working in Unix-like environments, it functions as an "awesome list" resource cataloging native macOS terminal commands, third-party CLI applications, and shell scripting techniques. The repository addresses the common problem of discovering and leveraging macOS-specific command-line functionality that differs from standard Linux distributions, including system configuration commands, file management utilities, and macOS-unique features accessible through Terminal.app or alternative shell environments. While the main repository has migrated to a self-hosted Git instance, it continues to serve the macOS development and system administration community by providing comprehensive documentation of command-line workflows specific to the macOS ecosystem.
