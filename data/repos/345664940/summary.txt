`nextjournal/clerk` is a Clojure library for creating moldable, live programming notebooks directly from Clojure namespaces and Markdown files. It functions as a local-first notebook environment, eliminating the need for separate editors or file formats. Key functionalities include top-to-bottom evaluation of Clojure code within notebooks, dependency graph management for efficient recomputation, and integration with existing Clojure workflows. This project is a Clojure library designed to improve developer productivity and facilitate reproducible computational workflows by allowing the use of existing editors and source control.
