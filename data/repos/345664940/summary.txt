Clerk is a local-first computational notebook library for Clojure that transforms regular Clojure namespaces into interactive, web-based notebooks for data science and exploratory programming. It addresses traditional notebook problems by eliminating out-of-order execution through dependency graph-based evaluation, using standard Clojure files instead of proprietary formats, and running within the existing Clojure REPL process rather than requiring separate environments. The system combines prose documentation with executable code visualization, targeting Clojure developers who need reproducible computational documents while maintaining their preferred editors and development workflows. Clerk serves notebooks via a built-in webserver, supports live reloading with file watchers, and can build static HTML output, making it suitable for data scientists, researchers, and developers working on analytical applications who require version-controllable, reproducible computational narratives.
