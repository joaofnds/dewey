cheat.sh is a unified command-line cheat sheet service that aggregates programming and system administration reference materials from community-driven repositories. Built in Python, it provides HTTP/HTTPS API access via curl to deliver concise documentation for over 56 programming languages, database management systems, and 1000+ UNIX/Linux commands. The service generates dynamic responses by combining curated cheat sheets with StackOverflow content, supporting namespace-based queries for language-specific topics (e.g., `/python/lambda`, `/go/Pointers`) and keyword searches. Targeted at developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators, it integrates with popular editors (Vim, Emacs, VS Code) and offers both web-based and offline self-hosted deployment options via Docker, solving the problem of fragmented technical documentation access across development workflows.
