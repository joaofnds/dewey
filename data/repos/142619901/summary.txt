GNvim is a standalone GUI application for Neovim, offering a graphical user interface for the popular text editor. Built using Rust and GTK4, it provides a native desktop experience without web technologies. Key functionalities include a graphical interface for interacting with Neovim, and installation options via Flatpak and system-wide packages.  The project's architecture utilizes a custom RPC client with code generation to create Neovim API bindings.
