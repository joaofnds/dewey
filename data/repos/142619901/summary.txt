GNvim is a native GUI frontend for Neovim built with Rust and GTK4, targeting software developers who prefer lightweight desktop text editors over web-based alternatives. The application uses a custom RPC client with auto-generated bindings to communicate with Neovim's API, providing a native windowed interface without Electron or browser dependencies. It leverages libadwaita for modern GTK theming and requires Neovim 0.10+ as the backend text editing engine. The project addresses the need for performance-oriented GUI text editors in software development workflows, offering an alternative to web-bloated editors while maintaining Neovim's extensibility and modal editing capabilities. Distribution is supported through both traditional system installation and Flatpak packaging for Linux desktop environments.
