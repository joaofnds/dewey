rqlite is a distributed relational database system that combines SQLite's embedded database engine with Raft consensus protocol to create a fault-tolerant, clustered SQL database. Built in Go, it targets DevOps teams and backend developers who need a lightweight, operationally simple alternative to traditional distributed databases like PostgreSQL clusters or MySQL Galera. The system provides HTTP/REST APIs for database operations, supports dynamic clustering with Kubernetes integration, and offers configurable consistency levels for read/write operations. It solves the operational complexity problem of running distributed relational databases by eliminating the need for separate database server installations while maintaining ACID properties and providing automatic leader election, replication, and failover capabilities for mission-critical applications requiring high availability.
