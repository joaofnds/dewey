Laundry is a formal grammar specification and parser implementation for Org mode syntax written in Racket using the `#lang brag` parser generator. It targets documentation tooling and text processing domains by providing a reference implementation for parsing Org mode files, addressing the inconsistent parsing behavior found in the original Emacs Lisp implementation. The project implements a comprehensive grammar covering most Org syntax elements including headlines, tags, and Org babel code blocks, with performance optimizations to handle complex tokenization efficiently. It serves developers and tool creators who need reliable Org mode parsing capabilities for building documentation systems, static site generators, or text processing applications that interact with Org format files, offering both programmatic parsing APIs and command-line interfaces for file processing.
