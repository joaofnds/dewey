Simplifile is a cross-platform file system operations library for the Gleam programming language, providing synchronous file and directory manipulation APIs that work consistently across Erlang, Node.js, Deno, and Bun runtime targets. The library addresses the fundamental concurrency model differences between Erlang and JavaScript environments by deliberately limiting itself to synchronous operations, enabling a unified codebase for multi-target deployment. It supports core file operations including read, write, append, delete, and directory management functions, targeting developers building development tools, configuration management systems, build scripts, and CLI applications where cross-platform compatibility is prioritized over asynchronous performance. The library serves Gleam developers in the systems programming and tooling domain who need reliable file system interactions across heterogeneous runtime environments without target-specific code branching.
