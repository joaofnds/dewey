`simplifile` is a Gleam library providing synchronous file and directory operations for Erlang, Node.js, Deno, and Bun targets. It offers functionalities including file writing, appending, reading, and deleting, designed for scenarios where consistent file handling across different runtime environments is crucial. The library prioritizes a unified API across targets, trading off asynchronous capabilities for simplicity and cross-platform compatibility, targeting developers working on projects where synchronous file operations are acceptable, such as development tooling or configuration management, and where code portability between Erlang and JavaScript environments is beneficial.
