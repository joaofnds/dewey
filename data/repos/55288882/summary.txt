homebrew-emacs-plus is a Homebrew tap (third-party package repository) that provides enhanced GNU Emacs formulae for macOS developers and power users. Written in Ruby using Homebrew's formula DSL, it offers multiple Emacs versions (29, 30, 31) with extensive customization options including native compilation (gccemacs), WebKit support (xwidgets), custom icon sets, titlebar modifications, and patches for popular Emacs distributions like Doom Emacs and Spacemacs. The repository addresses limitations of the standard Homebrew Emacs package by providing additional features, build options, and macOS-specific optimizations that aren't available in the default formula. It targets Emacs enthusiasts, software developers, and users of sophisticated Emacs configurations who require more control over their editor's compilation flags, dependencies, and visual presentation on macOS systems.
