This repository serves as a centralized archive of standardized mechanical keyboard switch evaluation scorecards in PDF format, created by ThereminGoat for the mechanical keyboard enthusiast community. The repository contains structured one-sheet scoring documents that systematically rate keyboard switches across multiple performance categories, complementing long-form reviews published on the associated website. Updated weekly, it includes both scorecards for reviewed switches and supplemental evaluations for switches without full reviews, plus composite comparison sheets in XLSX and CSV formats for cross-switch analysis. The system addresses the need for consistent, comparable switch evaluation metrics in the mechanical keyboard hardware domain, targeting keyboard enthusiasts, reviewers, and consumers seeking data-driven switch selection guidance through standardized scoring methodologies.
