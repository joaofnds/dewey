The `switch-scores` repository houses a curated collection of Portable Document Format (PDF) score sheets for mechanical keyboard switches. These score sheets provide a standardized assessment of switch characteristics, offering a comparative analysis that aids in switch selection. The project includes individual scorecards and composite score sheets in XLSX and CSV formats, enabling convenient switch comparison and ranking. This is a data-driven resource, specifically targeting keyboard enthusiasts and switch reviewers, and acts as a reference guide for mechanical keyboard switch performance evaluation.
