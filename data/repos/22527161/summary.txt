Jsonnet is a data templating language designed for generating JSON configuration files in DevOps and infrastructure management workflows. This repository contains the original C++ implementation of the Jsonnet interpreter and formatter, providing a functional programming approach to eliminate duplication and enable programmatic generation of complex configuration data. The language extends JSON with variables, conditionals, arithmetic, functions, and inheritance capabilities, primarily targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and infrastructure developers who manage Kubernetes manifests, monitoring configurations, and other structured data formats. The implementation includes command-line tools (jsonnet, jsonnetfmt), supports multiple build systems (Make, Bazel, CMake), offers language bindings for Python, and provides both native compilation and WebAssembly targets for web integration, solving the configuration management complexity common in cloud-native and distributed systems.
