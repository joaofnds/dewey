Touchégg is a standalone C++ application for Linux, designed to recognize multi-touch gestures on touchpads and touchscreens, enabling users to map gestures to desktop actions. Functionality includes gesture recognition via libinput, configurable actions such as window management (maximize, minimize, tile, fullscreen, close), workspace switching, and the execution of custom commands or keyboard shortcuts. The project provides a daemon, with a configuration file to define gestures and actions, and a separate GUI application named "Touché" for easier configuration, targeting Linux users seeking enhanced desktop interaction.
