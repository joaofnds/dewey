Touch√©gg is a Linux gesture recognition daemon written in C++ that enables multi-touch gesture control for desktop environments. Built on libinput, it runs as a background service that captures touchpad and touchscreen gestures (swipes, pinches, taps) and translates them into desktop actions like window management, workspace switching, and keyboard shortcuts. The application targets Linux desktop users and system administrators seeking to enhance their workflow with intuitive touch controls. It provides XML-based configuration for gesture customization and integrates with various desktop environments including GNOME, elementary OS, and KDE. The software addresses the gap in native multi-touch gesture support across Linux distributions, offering functionality similar to macOS trackpad gestures. It's packaged for major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch) and serves both end-users wanting enhanced desktop interaction and developers building touch-enabled Linux systems.
