Deno is a modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtime built on V8, Rust, and Tokio that serves as an alternative to Node.js for server-side development and web applications. Targeting web developers and backend engineers, it addresses security and developer experience issues in the JavaScript ecosystem by implementing secure-by-default permissions, native TypeScript support without transpilation, and built-in tooling for testing, formatting, and linting. The runtime leverages Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics while maintaining JavaScript compatibility through V8, primarily serving the web development domain for building web servers, APIs, and command-line tools with improved security posture and streamlined development workflow.
