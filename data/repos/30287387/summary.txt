This repository is a Hubot plugin written in CoffeeScript that generates Seinfeld-style logos from user-provided text input. It integrates with the Hubot chatbot framework, commonly used in DevOps and team collaboration environments like Slack or HipChat, to provide an entertainment utility within chat channels. The plugin responds to the command "hubot seinfeld me <input>" and leverages an external Seinfeld logo generator to create styled text graphics mimicking the iconic TV show's branding. Targeted at development teams and system administrators who use Hubot for workflow automation and team engagement, it serves as a novelty tool for creating humorous visual content during team interactions. The implementation follows standard Hubot plugin architecture with npm package distribution and external-scripts.json configuration for easy installation and deployment in existing Hubot instances.
