**displayplacer** is a macOS command-line utility written in C that provides programmatic control over multi-display configurations, functioning as the macOS equivalent of Linux's XRandR. The tool targets system administrators, power users, and automation engineers who need to script display management tasks across multiple monitors. It leverages macOS Core Graphics APIs to configure screen resolutions, orientations (0/90/180/270 degrees), scaling settings, spatial arrangements, mirroring configurations, and display enabling/disabling. The utility addresses the limitation of macOS System Preferences by enabling headless display configuration, supporting automation workflows through shell scripting, and providing access to extended resolution modes not visible in the GUI, making it essential for multi-monitor setups in professional environments.
