`displayplacer` is a command-line utility written in C for macOS, designed to configure multi-display resolutions and arrangements. Functionality mirrors XRandR, enabling users to list screen information, apply custom screen configurations (resolution, refresh rate, color depth, scaling, origin, and rotation), disable/enable screens, and manage mirrored displays. This standalone CLI application provides a scripting-friendly interface for automating display settings, targeting system administrators and users needing precise control over external monitor setups.
