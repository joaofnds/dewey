Apache Mesos is a distributed cluster resource manager written in C++ that provides dynamic resource allocation and isolation across multiple compute frameworks on shared node pools. Operating in the cloud computing and distributed systems domain, it serves as an abstraction layer between applications and underlying infrastructure, enabling frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, Jenkins, and Aurora to efficiently share cluster resources. The system implements a two-level scheduling architecture where Mesos manages resource offers to frameworks, which then schedule their own tasks. Primarily targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and infrastructure teams managing large-scale distributed computing environments, Mesos solves the problem of resource fragmentation and utilization inefficiency in multi-tenant cluster deployments by providing centralized resource management with framework-level scheduling autonomy.
