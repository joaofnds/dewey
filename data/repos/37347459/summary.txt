ungoogled-chromium is a privacy-focused modification of Google Chromium that removes dependencies on Google web services while maintaining browser compatibility. The project targets web privacy advocates, security-conscious users, and system administrators seeking Google-free browsing solutions. Built using Python build scripts, configuration patches, and domain substitution techniques, it implements binary pruning to strip Google-specific code, blocks internal requests to Google domains through runtime filtering, and disables features like Safe Browsing and Google Host Detector. The repository provides cross-platform build configurations for Linux, macOS, and Windows, utilizing custom packaging wrappers and patch management systems. It addresses the web browser privacy domain by offering enhanced user control through additional command-line switches and chrome://flags entries while preserving the standard Chromium user experience for developers and privacy-focused end users.
