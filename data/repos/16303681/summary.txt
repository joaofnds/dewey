`asmttpd` is a standalone, multi-threaded web server for Linux, implemented entirely in amd64 assembly. It serves static files from a specified document root, supporting features like HEAD requests and partial content delivery (206 responses), along with various content types including HTML, XML, images, CSS, and JavaScript. The project's architecture emphasizes a small binary size and aims for high performance, using system calls directly and avoiding external libraries. It's a CLI application designed for system administrators and developers requiring a lightweight and potentially high-performance web server.
