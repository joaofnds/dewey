asmttpd is a minimal HTTP web server implementation written entirely in x86-64 assembly language for Linux systems. Targeting system programmers and performance enthusiasts in web development, it demonstrates low-level network programming using direct Linux system calls without external libraries. The server implements core HTTP/1.1 functionality including multi-threaded request handling, static file serving, partial content responses (HTTP 206), and common MIME type detection for web assets. It uses Linux-specific system calls like sendfile for efficient file transfers and implements TCP socket programming at the assembly level. The project serves as both a educational reference for assembly programming and a ultra-lightweight web server solution for embedded systems or performance-critical applications where minimal resource footprint and direct hardware control are prioritized over feature completeness.
