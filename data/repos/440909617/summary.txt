Wireit is a TypeScript-based build orchestration tool that enhances npm/pnpm/yarn scripts for JavaScript and TypeScript development workflows. It provides intelligent dependency management, parallel execution, incremental builds, and local/remote caching for npm scripts in single packages, workspaces, and monorepos. The tool integrates with existing package.json configurations by moving script commands into a dedicated "wireit" section while maintaining compatibility with standard npm run commands. Key features include automatic dependency resolution between scripts, file-based change detection using glob patterns, GitHub Actions caching integration, and watch mode for continuous rebuilds. Targeted at frontend developers and DevOps engineers managing complex JavaScript/TypeScript build pipelines, Wireit solves build efficiency and coordination problems in modern web development projects without requiring migration away from existing npm-based toolchains.
