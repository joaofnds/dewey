Wireit is a developer productivity tool designed to enhance npm/pnpm/yarn scripts, making them smarter and more efficient. This TypeScript-based utility enables automatic parallel execution of script dependencies, supports incremental builds with caching (local and GitHub Actions), and provides a watch mode for automatic re-runs on file changes. Key features include dependency management, input/output file tracking, and integration with VSCode via an extension, targeting developers working with single packages and monorepos.
