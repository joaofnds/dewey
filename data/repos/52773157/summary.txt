TypeORM is a comprehensive Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript applications, designed for full-stack web development and cross-platform application development. It provides an abstraction layer for database operations across multiple SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MS SQL Server, Oracle, SAP Hana) and MongoDB, supporting both Active Record and Data Mapper design patterns. The library enables developers to define database entities using TypeScript decorators and perform CRUD operations through repository patterns or direct entity methods. TypeORM solves the impedance mismatch between object-oriented programming and relational databases while supporting advanced features like migrations, query building, transactions, and connection pooling across NodeJS, browser, mobile (React Native, Ionic), and desktop (Electron) environments.
