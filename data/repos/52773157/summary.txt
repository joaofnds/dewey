TypeORM is a TypeScript and JavaScript ORM designed for database interaction across various platforms, including NodeJS, browsers, and mobile environments. It supports both Active Record and Data Mapper patterns, offering features like entities, relations (one-to-one, many-to-one, many-to-many), query building, and database migrations. Supporting multiple database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, it provides a unified interface for database operations, making it suitable for building applications from small to large scale. As a library, it empowers developers to manage database interactions efficiently using object-oriented paradigms.
