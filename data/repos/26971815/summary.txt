**wego** is a terminal-based weather forecasting application written in Go that provides command-line access to weather data through ASCII art visualization. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and terminal-power users, it integrates with weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap and WorldWeatherOnline) to display 1-7 day forecasts with comprehensive meteorological data including temperature ranges, wind speed/direction, precipitation probability, and viewing distance in both metric and imperial units. The application features UTF-8 terminal rendering with 256-color ASCII art icons, multi-language support, SSL-secured API communication, and configuration management through the ingo library. It solves the problem of accessing weather information without leaving the terminal environment, making it particularly valuable for CLI-focused workflows and server administration tasks where GUI weather applications are unavailable or impractical.
