`wego` is a terminal-based weather application written in Go. It displays weather forecasts, including temperature, wind information, and precipitation details, using ASCII art icons and supporting both metric and imperial units.  The application utilizes an API key from Openweathermap or Worldweatheronline and saves configuration settings to a `.wegorc` file.  It is a standalone command-line application targeted at users seeking weather information directly in their terminal environment and leverages Go as its primary language, along with external dependencies for configuration and API interactions.
