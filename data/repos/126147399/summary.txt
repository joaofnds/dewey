ReLaXed is a JavaScript-based framework designed to generate PDF documents from web technologies like HTML and Pug. It allows users to define document layouts using CSS and JavaScript, supporting features such as Markdown and LaTeX-style equation rendering, and integrating with JavaScript libraries for charting and diagram generation. The project is a command-line tool that leverages Puppeteer and Chromium for PDF conversion, targeting developers who prefer markup languages over traditional GUI document editors, making it ideal for creating books, reports, and other document types.
