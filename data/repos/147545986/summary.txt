C4-PlantUML is a library that extends PlantUML with macros, stereotypes, and templates to create C4 model architecture diagrams for software systems. Targeting software architects, developers, and technical teams in enterprise software development, it provides a code-as-documentation approach for visualizing system architecture across four hierarchical levels: Context, Container, Component, and Code. The library leverages PlantUML's text-based diagramming capabilities and Graphviz rendering to generate standardized architectural diagrams that follow Simon Brown's C4 modeling methodology. It addresses the need for consistent, maintainable architecture documentation by enabling teams to describe complex software architectures through simple, version-controllable text files, particularly useful during design sessions and technical communication with stakeholders.
