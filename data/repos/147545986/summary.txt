`C4-PlantUML` is a library that integrates the C4 model for software architecture with PlantUML, enabling the creation of diagrams for describing and communicating software architectures. It allows users to generate system context, container, component, dynamic, and deployment diagrams using the PlantUML domain-specific language. Key features include macros, stereotypes, and snippets for Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ, facilitating diagram creation with a focus on architectural clarity. This is a library primarily aimed at software architects and developers for documenting and visualizing software systems using a declarative, text-based approach.
