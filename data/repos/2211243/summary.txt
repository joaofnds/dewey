Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform built in Java and Scala, designed for high-throughput data pipeline and real-time analytics applications. It serves the data engineering and distributed systems domain, providing publish-subscribe messaging, stream processing, and event sourcing capabilities for enterprise-scale data integration. The platform targets backend developers, data engineers, and system architects building microservices architectures, ETL pipelines, and event-driven systems. Kafka solves challenges around decoupling data producers from consumers, handling massive message volumes with low latency, and enabling real-time data processing across distributed systems. Built with Gradle, it requires Java 11+ runtime and supports both unit and integration testing frameworks for mission-critical streaming applications.
