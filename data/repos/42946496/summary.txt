whoami is a lightweight Go-based HTTP server designed for network debugging, testing, and monitoring in DevOps and web development environments. Built as a containerized microservice, it exposes multiple endpoints that return detailed system information including hostname, IP addresses, HTTP request headers, and environment variables in both plain text and JSON formats. The server supports TLS/mTLS configurations, WebSocket echo functionality, health check endpoints with configurable status codes, and gRPC protocols for comprehensive network diagnostics. Primarily used by DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers for troubleshooting reverse proxies, load balancers, and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, it serves as a simple yet effective tool for validating network connectivity, request routing, and infrastructure configuration in distributed systems.
