This repository implements an interactive web application that generates "spacetime maps" - cartographic visualizations where geographical distances are distorted to represent travel time rather than physical distance. Built with a Python backend using the Google Maps API for travel time data collection and a TypeScript/React frontend for map rendering and interaction, the system creates grid-based transformations of city maps across different transportation modes (driving, transit, walking). The backend exports JSON datasets containing travel time matrices, while the frontend applies geometric distortions to render the warped maps interactively. Targeted at geospatial visualization enthusiasts and urban planning researchers, it demonstrates advanced coordinate transformation techniques and API integration for creating novel cartographic representations that reveal transportation accessibility patterns in urban environments.
