This GitHub repository, `vvolhejn/spacetime-maps`, presents an innovative solution for visualizing travel time instead of physical distance in maps. The project leverages Python (backend) and TypeScript + React (frontend) to create interactive spacetime maps using the Google Maps API. Users can generate new maps by adjusting parameters such as center, zoom level, grid size, and travel mode, with the option to add them to a dropdown menu for easy selection. The project is primarily useful for urban planners, transportation engineers, and anyone interested in visualizing travel patterns over time.
