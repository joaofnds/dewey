Odin is a systems programming language compiler and runtime designed as a modern C alternative for high-performance software development. The language targets systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications through data-oriented programming paradigms and distinct typing systems. Built with cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, and macOS, Odin compiles to native machine code and emphasizes memory safety without garbage collection overhead. The compiler itself is implemented in Odin and provides comprehensive standard libraries for core system operations and vendor integrations. Primary users include systems programmers, game developers, and performance-focused software engineers seeking lower-level control with modern language features while avoiding the complexity and pitfalls of C/C++ development workflows.
