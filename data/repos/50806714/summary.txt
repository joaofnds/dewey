This repository provides a comprehensive technical guide for implementing hardware-based cryptographic security using YubiKey devices as smart cards for GnuPG and SSH operations. Targeting system administrators, security engineers, and privacy-conscious developers, it addresses the critical security problem of protecting private cryptographic keys by storing them on tamper-resistant hardware rather than filesystem-based storage. The guide covers the complete workflow from YubiKey configuration and GnuPG key generation to SSH agent setup, covering RSA cryptography, GPG agent forwarding, smartcard integration, and secure remote access protocols. It emphasizes operational security practices including air-gapped key generation environments, proper key backup procedures, and hardening techniques, making it essential for DevOps professionals and security practitioners implementing zero-trust architectures and hardware security key deployments in enterprise environments.
