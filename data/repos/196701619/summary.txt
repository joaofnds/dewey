Tauri is a Rust-based framework for building cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using web frontend technologies. It targets web developers who want to create native applications by combining HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontends with Rust backends, eliminating the need for Electron's overhead. The framework leverages system webviews (WKWebView on macOS/iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux, Android System WebView) through the WRY library and uses tao for window management. Tauri provides built-in app bundling for various distribution formats (.app, .dmg, .deb, .rpm, .exe, .msi), self-updating capabilities, system tray integration, and native notifications. It addresses the performance and security limitations of traditional web-to-native solutions by producing smaller, faster binaries while maintaining the familiar web development workflow for frontend developers building desktop and mobile applications.
