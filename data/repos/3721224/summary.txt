Built for the web development domain, it provides hardware-accelerated CSS transitions and native touch gesture handling for mobile-first user interfaces. The library targets frontend developers building responsive websites, progressive web apps, and hybrid mobile applications that require smooth, performant image galleries, content carousels, or navigation components. Swiper focuses specifically on modern browsers and mobile platforms, implementing swipe gestures, touch events, and GPU-accelerated animations to deliver native-like scrolling experiences. It serves as a lightweight, tree-shakeable alternative to heavier carousel solutions, addressing the need for optimized touch interactions in contemporary mobile web development workflows.
