`bclm` is a command-line utility for macOS, written in Swift, designed to manage and limit the maximum battery charge level of Mac computers, both Intel and Apple silicon, to extend battery health. It reads and writes battery charge level max (BCLM) values to the System Management Controller (SMC). Functionality includes reading and writing BCLM values, and persisting these settings via launchd for consistent application. This standalone application, targeting users of macOS systems, leverages the SMC to implement the 40-80 rule for lithium-ion battery health.
