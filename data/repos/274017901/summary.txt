BCLM is a macOS command-line utility written in Swift that interfaces with the System Management Controller (SMC) to programmatically limit maximum battery charge levels on Mac computers. It supports both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures and addresses battery health management by implementing the 40-80% charging rule for lithium-ion batteries. The tool provides read/write operations for battery charge level max (BCLM) and CHWA values, with persistence capabilities through launchd daemons to survive SMC resets. Target users are macOS system administrators, power users, and developers who need to optimize battery longevity on Macs used as desktop replacements or continuously plugged-in systems. The utility requires root privileges for write operations and integrates with macOS system services for automated battery management.
