AgenticSeek is a fully local AI agent framework built in Python that provides a privacy-focused alternative to cloud-based AI assistants like Manus AI. The system implements autonomous web browsing, code generation, and task planning capabilities using local LLM inference through providers like Ollama, LM-Studio, or cloud APIs. Core technologies include Selenium WebDriver for web automation, Docker Compose for service orchestration, SearXNG for web search, Redis for caching, and voice interfaces using speech-to-text/text-to-speech. The framework supports multiple reasoning models (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen) and features agentic task decomposition, multi-language support, and session persistence. Target users are developers and AI enthusiasts seeking autonomous coding assistants and web automation tools without cloud dependencies or subscription costs.
