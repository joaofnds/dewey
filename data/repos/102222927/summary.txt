This repository provides an unofficial PDF and LaTeX source for Bartosz Milewski's "Category Theory for Programmers," a book introducing category theory concepts. It's a research artifact and educational resource focused on functional programming and category theory, offering PDF versions generated from LaTeX source files. The project leverages LaTeX for typesetting and Nix for building the PDF editions. The target audience is likely programmers and computer science enthusiasts interested in functional programming and category theory.
