This repository provides an unofficial PDF compilation of Bartosz Milewski's "Category Theory for Programmers" educational content, targeting functional programming practitioners and computer science educators. Built using LaTeX and managed through Nix flakes, it converts the original blog post series into professionally formatted PDF documents with multiple language editions (Haskell, Scala, OCaml, Reason). The project serves the functional programming and theoretical computer science community by making category theory concepts accessible to programmers working with languages like Haskell, Scala, and OCaml. It addresses the need for a consolidated, printable reference combining mathematical category theory with practical programming applications, particularly for developers transitioning from imperative to functional programming paradigms or academic instructors teaching advanced programming concepts.
