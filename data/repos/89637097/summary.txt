`campoy/justforfunc` is a repository containing source code examples for the YouTube series "JustForFunc," focused on teaching Go programming through practical examples and code reviews. The project showcases diverse Go applications, including command-line tools (e.g., tree command implementation, Cobra-based CLI), network applications (e.g., gRPC server, text-to-speech server), and code examples involving libraries like `gonum/plot` for data visualization. The repository also features code reviews of external projects and discussions on Go language features, targeting Go developers and learners seeking practical implementations and insights into the Go ecosystem. This acts as a collection of example projects derived from the YouTube video series.
