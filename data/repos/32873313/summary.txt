systemd is a comprehensive system and service manager that serves as the init system for modern Linux distributions, written in C. It targets the Linux system administration and DevOps domain, providing centralized management of system services, processes, mount points, network configuration, and boot procedures. The project replaces traditional SysV init systems with a dependency-based service management architecture that enables parallel service startup, socket-based activation, and advanced logging through journald. systemd addresses core system-level problems including service lifecycle management, system resource control via cgroups, and unified system state management. It primarily serves system administrators, distribution maintainers, and DevOps engineers who need reliable, feature-rich system initialization and service orchestration capabilities on Linux platforms.
