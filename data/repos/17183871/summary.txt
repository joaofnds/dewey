iperf3 is a network performance measurement tool written in C that actively tests TCP, UDP, and SCTP bandwidth capacity on IP networks. Targeting network administrators, DevOps engineers, and system administrators in enterprise IT and research networking environments, it measures maximum achievable throughput, packet loss, and network parameters through client-server architecture. The tool supports advanced features like zero-copy mode using sendfile(), CPU affinity settings, JSON output formatting, and configurable timing/buffer parameters. Developed by ESnet/Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for network troubleshooting and performance validation, iperf3 represents a complete rewrite with library functionality for integration into other network monitoring and diagnostic applications, specifically designed for Unix-like systems including Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS.
