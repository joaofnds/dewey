Hubs is a client-side JavaScript application that implements a multi-user virtual reality collaboration platform for web browsers, targeting the WebVR/WebXR domain. Built on A-Frame and Three.js frameworks, it creates 3D virtual spaces accessible across desktop, mobile, and VR devices without requiring native app installations. The platform leverages WebRTC for real-time peer-to-peer communication and integrates with a Phoenix/Elixir backend (Reticulum) for state management and user presence synchronization. Utilizing Networked A-Frame for multi-user interactions, it solves the problem of cross-platform 3D collaboration by providing browser-based virtual meeting spaces. The codebase targets web developers working on immersive web applications, VR experiences, and real-time collaborative platforms, offering an open-source alternative to proprietary virtual meeting solutions.
