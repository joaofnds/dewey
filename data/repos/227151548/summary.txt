The `compose-spec/compose-spec` repository defines a specification for multi-container, platform-agnostic application definitions. It provides a standard for describing containerized applications, enabling portability across different container orchestration platforms. Key functionalities include specifying application components, their dependencies, and configurations, facilitating consistent deployment across development tools, Kubernetes, and cloud providers. The project primarily utilizes `Dockerfile` as a code language, and is a specification document with implementations like Docker Compose, Kompose, and Podman Compose that translate the Compose specification into actionable deployments. Its intended audience is developers building and deploying containerized applications.
