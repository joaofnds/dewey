The Compose Specification defines a standardized, platform-agnostic format for declaring multi-container applications using YAML-based configuration files. Targeting the DevOps and containerization domain, it serves as the foundational specification for Docker Compose and enables interoperability across container orchestration platforms including Kubernetes, cloud providers, and alternative container runtimes like Podman and containerd. The specification addresses the problem of vendor lock-in and configuration fragmentation in container deployment by providing a unified abstraction layer that can be translated to platform-specific APIs (Kubernetes manifests, cloud provider formats). Primary users include DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who need to define, deploy, and manage containerized applications consistently across development, staging, and production environments while maintaining portability between different container orchestration systems.
