This JavaScript library provides a declarative hotkey system for web applications, enabling developers to bind keyboard shortcuts to DOM elements through HTML data attributes. Built for frontend web development, it supports complex key combinations, modifier keys (Control, Alt, Meta, Shift), key sequences, and scoped shortcuts within specific form elements. The library handles cross-platform modifier normalization (using "Mod" for Meta on macOS, Control on Windows/Linux) and automatically triggers appropriate actions (focus for form elements, click for buttons). Used extensively by GitHub for site-wide keyboard navigation, it targets web developers building interactive interfaces who need robust keyboard accessibility and power-user features without manually managing event listeners and key detection logic.
