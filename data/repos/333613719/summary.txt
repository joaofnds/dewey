Affe is an asynchronous fuzzy finder package for Emacs written in pure Elisp, designed to provide fzf-like functionality within the Emacs editor ecosystem. It targets Emacs users and developers who need efficient file and content searching capabilities during code editing and navigation. The package leverages external processes (find, grep, ripgrep) as producers while offloading filtering to separate Emacs processes to maintain UI responsiveness. It integrates with Consult for minibuffer presentation, supports Orderless completion styles for regex compilation, and provides two main commands: affe-grep for content searching and affe-find for file path filtering. Unlike fzf's Smith-Waterman algorithm, Affe uses regex-based matching with all-completions for performance, making it suitable for developers seeking integrated fuzzy finding within their Emacs workflow without external dependencies.
