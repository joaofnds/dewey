KinoDB is an Elixir library that provides database integration capabilities for Livebook, an interactive notebook environment. Built on the Kino framework, it enables data scientists and Elixir developers to establish database connections and execute queries directly within Livebook notebooks. The library targets the data science and interactive computing domain, allowing users to seamlessly integrate various database systems into their analytical workflows. By leveraging Elixir's actor model and functional programming paradigm, KinoDB bridges the gap between traditional database operations and modern notebook-based data exploration, making it particularly valuable for developers working with data analysis, prototyping, and educational use cases within the Elixir ecosystem.
