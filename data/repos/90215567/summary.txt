`attr_json` is a Ruby library providing a seamless way to store and manage serialized JSON-backed attributes within ActiveRecord models, specifically targeting Rails applications. It enables type-casting and validation for attributes stored in JSON or JSONB columns, leveraging ActiveModel::Type types. Key functionalities include nested model support, dirty tracking, limited querying using PostgreSQL's `jsonb_contains` operator, and integration with form builders. This library is designed for backend developers working with Rails and PostgreSQL, offering a means to handle complex, object-oriented data within a relational database context by treating JSON as a typed object store.
