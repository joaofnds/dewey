AttrJson is a Ruby gem that extends ActiveRecord to enable seamless serialization of typed attributes within PostgreSQL JSONB columns, targeting Rails web developers working with complex data models. It provides a typed object store layer on top of ActiveRecord, allowing developers to define strongly-typed JSON attributes with full ActiveRecord integration including type casting, dirty tracking, validation, and form builder compatibility. The gem supports nested models, array attributes, default values, and JSONB querying capabilities using PostgreSQL's containment operators. Designed for Rails 6.0+ applications, it enables developers to store structured data alongside traditional relational columns without sacrificing ActiveRecord's familiar API patterns, making it particularly valuable for applications requiring flexible schema design while maintaining type safety and ActiveRecord conveniences.
