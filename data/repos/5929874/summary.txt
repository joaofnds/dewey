cl-async is an asynchronous I/O library for Common Lisp that provides non-blocking programming capabilities using libuv (Node.js's backend library) as its core engine. The library targets Common Lisp developers building network applications, web services, and concurrent systems requiring high-performance I/O operations. It offers comprehensive async primitives including TCP/SSL networking, DNS resolution, timers, signal handling, futures, threading utilities, and event-driven programming constructs. The library addresses the fundamental problem of blocking I/O in traditional Lisp applications by enabling developers to write scalable, concurrent programs that can handle thousands of simultaneous connections without thread-per-connection overhead. It serves as foundational infrastructure for building async drivers and frameworks in the Common Lisp ecosystem, particularly for server-side development and network programming applications.
