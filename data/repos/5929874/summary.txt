`cl-async` is a Common Lisp library providing asynchronous I/O capabilities. It leverages libuv, a high-performance, portable library for asynchronous operations, enabling non-blocking programming within Common Lisp applications. The library offers a range of features, including timers, signal handling, DNS resolution, TCP/SSL support, threading, and event handling, along with numerous drivers. Primarily a library for developers, it facilitates the construction of more responsive and efficient Common Lisp programs through asynchronous operations.
