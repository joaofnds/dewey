Fiber is a high-performance web framework for Go that provides an Express.js-like API for building REST APIs and web applications. Built on top of Fasthttp, it targets the web development domain by offering zero memory allocation routing, middleware support, and familiar HTTP server patterns for Go developers migrating from Node.js/Express ecosystems. The framework emphasizes performance optimization through connection pooling, efficient request handling, and minimal garbage collection overhead. It solves the problem of Go's verbose standard HTTP library by providing a more developer-friendly interface while maintaining Go's performance advantages. Primary users are backend developers and system architects building web services, REST APIs, and microservices who need Express-style simplicity with Go's concurrency and speed characteristics.
