Permify is an open-source authorization-as-a-service built in Go, designed for creating and managing fine-grained, scalable, and extensible access control systems for applications. Inspired by Google Zanzibar, it enables developers to implement granular permissions (RBAC, ReBAC, and ABAC compatible) in minutes, abstracting authorization logic from application code. Key features include a domain-specific language for defining authorization models, a gRPC and REST API, and support for cloud-native deployments, with demonstrated performance of sub-10ms access checks under heavy load. This project offers both a self-hosted community edition and a cloud-based managed service and functions primarily as a backend API and supporting SDK for developers building secure applications.
