Permify is an open-source authorization service built in Go that implements Google Zanzibar's fine-grained access control model for distributed systems. It provides a gRPC-based authorization-as-a-service platform that supports RBAC, ReBAC, and ABAC permission models through a domain-specific language for defining authorization policies. The system is designed for cloud-native environments with Kubernetes deployment support, enabling developers to externalize complex authorization logic from application code. It targets backend developers and system architects building multi-tenant applications who need scalable, centralized permission management with sub-millisecond query response times. The service handles relationship-based permissions, hierarchical access controls, and context-aware authorization decisions across microservices architectures, eliminating the need for custom authorization infrastructure development.
