This repository contains the source code for the official RabbitMQ documentation website (rabbitmq.com), built using Docusaurus 3 static site generator and JavaScript. It serves the messaging and distributed systems domain by providing comprehensive documentation for multiple concurrent RabbitMQ release series (3.13.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and development versions). The website implements versioned documentation management with automated deployment via Cloudflare workers, supporting both current and legacy RabbitMQ versions across different subdomains. It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and backend developers who need to implement message queuing and asynchronous communication patterns in distributed architectures. The repository uses a branching strategy that maintains documentation for active release series while archiving older versions, solving the challenge of maintaining accurate, version-specific technical documentation for enterprise messaging infrastructure.
