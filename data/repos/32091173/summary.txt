The `rabbitmq/rabbitmq-website` repository hosts the source code for the official RabbitMQ website, serving as the primary documentation and information resource for the message broker. It utilizes Docusaurus 3, a static website generator, to build and deploy documentation for multiple RabbitMQ release series, including development, and versioned documentation spanning several releases. The website features versioned documentation, deployed via Cloudflare workers and GitHub Actions, catering to various RabbitMQ versions with corresponding branches and subdirectories, allowing users to access documentation relevant to their installed version. It is a static website project written in JavaScript, targeted toward users and developers of RabbitMQ, enabling access to official documentation, guides, and resources.
