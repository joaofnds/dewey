The `emacs-mirror/emacs` repository mirrors the GNU Emacs text editor, a highly extensible and customizable software application. Built primarily in Emacs Lisp, it provides extensive text editing, programming, and document creation capabilities. This project represents a standalone application, acting as a developer productivity tool for a broad audience of programmers, writers, and users who require advanced text manipulation and editing features.
