GNU Emacs is a highly extensible, programmable text editor and integrated development environment implemented primarily in C and Emacs Lisp. It serves software developers, system administrators, and power users across multiple domains including software development, system configuration, document authoring, and text processing. The editor features a complete Lisp interpreter enabling deep customization, syntax highlighting for numerous programming languages, integrated debugging tools, version control interfaces, and extensible modes for various file types. Built using C for core functionality with Emacs Lisp for higher-level features, it supports cross-platform deployment on Unix-like systems, Windows, and macOS. Emacs addresses the need for a unified, keyboard-driven workspace that can be tailored to specific workflows through its comprehensive extension system and built-in programming environment.
