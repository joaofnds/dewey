coc-solargraph is a TypeScript-based language server extension that integrates the Solargraph Ruby language server with coc.nvim for Vim/Neovim editors. It enables Ruby developers to access modern IDE features including code completion, hover documentation, diagnostics, symbol navigation, go-to-definition, refactoring, and YARD documentation support within terminal-based editors. The extension supports multiple transport protocols (socket, stdio, external) for flexible deployment scenarios including Docker containers and remote development environments. It leverages the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to bridge Solargraph's Ruby intellisense capabilities with coc.nvim's completion framework, solving the problem of providing comprehensive Ruby development tooling in lightweight, keyboard-driven editors for developers who prefer terminal-based workflows over traditional IDEs.
