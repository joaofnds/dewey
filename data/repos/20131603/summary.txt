TypeDoc is a static documentation generator specifically designed for TypeScript projects, serving the web development and JavaScript ecosystem. Built with TypeScript and running on Node.js, it automatically parses TypeScript source code and generates comprehensive HTML documentation websites from type annotations, JSDoc comments, and code structure. The tool integrates with existing TypeScript toolchains by leveraging tsconfig.json configurations and supports various project architectures including monorepos and multi-package workspaces. TypeDoc addresses the critical need for maintaining up-to-date API documentation in TypeScript codebases by extracting type information directly from source code, eliminating documentation drift. It targets TypeScript developers, library maintainers, and development teams who need to generate professional documentation sites with customizable themes, multiple output formats including JSON, and seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines for automated documentation deployment.
