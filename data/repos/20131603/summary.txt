TypeDoc is a documentation generator specifically designed for TypeScript projects. It analyzes TypeScript code to produce API documentation, supporting features like custom theming and the generation of a JSON file describing the project's structure. The tool is used via a command-line interface (CLI) and integrates with Node.js projects via an NPM package, allowing developers to generate documentation from their TypeScript source code, including support for monorepos and workspaces. This project primarily serves TypeScript developers seeking to automate documentation generation for their libraries and applications.
