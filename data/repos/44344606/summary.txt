Chi is a lightweight HTTP router library for Go web development, designed specifically for building REST API services and microservices. Built on Go's standard library and context package, it provides URL routing, middleware composition, and request handling capabilities without external dependencies. The router supports RESTful route patterns, URL parameters with regex validation, subrouter mounting, and request-scoped context management for timeouts and cancellations. Targeting Go backend developers building scalable HTTP services, chi offers stdlib-compatible handlers, modular middleware architecture, and automatic API documentation generation. It addresses the need for maintainable, composable routing infrastructure in large-scale REST APIs while remaining performant and idiomatic to Go's HTTP ecosystem, making it suitable for enterprise web services and cloud-native applications.
