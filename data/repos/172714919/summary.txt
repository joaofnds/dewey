Sonic is a fast, lightweight, and schema-less search backend, providing an alternative to Elasticsearch for specific use cases. Written in Rust, it indexes search texts and identifier tuples for rapid querying, returning IDs for external database lookups. Key features include typo correction, auto-completion, multi-language support, and a simple TCP-based communication protocol (Sonic Channel) for data ingestion and querying. This standalone application primarily targets developers needing a performant, resource-efficient search solution, offering official and community libraries for integration across various languages.
