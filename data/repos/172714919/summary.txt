Sonic is a lightweight, schema-less search backend written in Rust that serves as a resource-efficient alternative to Elasticsearch for full-text search operations. It functions as an identifier index rather than a document store, ingesting text content and returning object IDs that reference external database records. The system provides microsecond-range query responses while consuming minimal RAM (~30MB), featuring capabilities like typo correction, auto-completion, Unicode support across 80+ languages, and real-time index updates. Designed for web developers and backend engineers building search functionality into applications, Sonic operates through collections and buckets organization model, making it suitable for multi-tenant platforms requiring separate search indexes per user or context without the overhead of traditional search engines.
