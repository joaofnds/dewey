Calfw is an Emacs Lisp calendar framework that renders interactive calendar views directly within Emacs buffers for productivity-focused developers and system administrators. It provides multiple viewing modes (month, week, day) with keyboard-driven navigation and integrates with popular Emacs-based productivity systems including Org-mode, Howm, iCalendar, and Emacs diary. The framework uses a modular source architecture through `cfw:source` structs to aggregate schedule data from multiple backends, supporting both content sources for events and annotation sources for metadata like holidays. It solves the problem of fragmented calendar access by centralizing schedule management within the Emacs ecosystem, enabling users to view and interact with calendars without leaving their text editor environment, particularly valuable for developers who live primarily in Emacs for coding, note-taking, and task management workflows.
