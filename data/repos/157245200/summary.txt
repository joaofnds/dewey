chezmoi is a Go-based dotfiles management system designed for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who work across multiple heterogeneous machines. It provides secure synchronization and templating of configuration files (dotfiles) across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments. The tool addresses the challenge of maintaining consistent development environments and system configurations when working with diverse infrastructure setups, remote servers, and personal machines. chezmoi implements security features for handling sensitive configuration data and uses templating to customize configurations per machine or environment. It targets infrastructure professionals and developers who need reproducible, version-controlled system configurations across their multi-platform workflows, eliminating manual configuration drift and setup overhead when provisioning new development environments or managing existing systems.
