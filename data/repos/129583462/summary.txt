`DataViz` is a Go library designed for building and visualizing various data structures. It provides implementations of common data structures, including lists, stacks, maps, and trees (Red-Black, AVL, B-Trees, and binary heaps), along with utilities for iteration, serialization (JSON), and sorting.  The library facilitates the creation of custom data structures while offering visualization capabilities leveraging Graphviz, which aids in understanding the structure and behavior of the data structures. This is a Go-based library primarily intended for developers seeking to explore and utilize data structures with visualization support within their Go projects.
