DataViz is a Go library that implements and visualizes common data structures through Graphviz-generated diagrams. It provides implementations of fundamental computer science data structures including linked lists, stacks, trees (Red-Black, AVL, B-Tree), heaps, and maps, while offering real-time visualization capabilities for educational and debugging purposes. The library targets software engineering education, algorithm learning, and development debugging workflows by combining traditional data structure operations with graphical representation tools. Built specifically for Go developers and computer science students, it leverages Graphviz for rendering structural diagrams and supports standard container operations, iterators, serialization, and sorting functionality. The visualization feature distinguishes it from standard data structure libraries by providing immediate visual feedback on structural changes and operations.
