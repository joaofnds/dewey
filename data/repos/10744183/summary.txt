Netdata is a real-time infrastructure monitoring and observability platform written in C, designed for DevOps and system administration use cases. It provides per-second metric collection, visualization, and anomaly detection across Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and Windows systems with zero-configuration deployment. The platform integrates with containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, InfluxDB), and monitoring ecosystems (Prometheus, Grafana). It features machine learning-powered alerting, distributed architecture with local data retention, and supports embedded systems including Raspberry Pi. Netdata targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and SREs who need immediate visibility into system performance, resource utilization, and application metrics without the overhead of traditional monitoring solutions that require complex configuration and centralized data collection.
