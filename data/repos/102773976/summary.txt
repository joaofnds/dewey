This repository serves as a comprehensive Ruby programming guide that adapts Robert C. Martin's "Clean Code" principles specifically for Ruby developers. It provides practical code examples demonstrating clean coding practices across core programming concepts including variable naming, method design, object-oriented programming, SOLID principles, testing, error handling, and code formatting. The guide targets Ruby developers and software engineers working in web development and general software engineering domains, offering before-and-after code comparisons to illustrate best practices for writing readable, maintainable, and refactorable Ruby code. By translating established clean code concepts into Ruby-specific implementations, it addresses the common problem of code quality and maintainability in Ruby applications, serving as both a learning resource for junior developers and a reference for experienced Ruby programmers seeking to improve their coding standards.
