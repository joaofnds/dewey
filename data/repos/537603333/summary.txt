Whisper is a Python library providing a general-purpose speech recognition model capable of multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. It utilizes a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture trained on a large, diverse audio dataset. Key functionalities include transcribing audio files with command-line and Python API interfaces, offering language detection, and translation capabilities. The project is designed as a Python package and depends on PyTorch, the tiktoken tokenizer, and the ffmpeg command-line tool. The library provides several pre-trained model sizes optimized for speed and accuracy tradeoffs.
