Whisper is a robust speech recognition system developed by OpenAI that implements a Transformer sequence-to-sequence model for multilingual audio processing tasks. Built with Python and PyTorch, it targets AI/ML developers, data scientists, and speech processing engineers who need production-ready automatic speech recognition (ASR) capabilities. The system performs multilingual speech transcription, speech-to-English translation, and language identification using large-scale weak supervision training. It offers six model variants (tiny to large) with different parameter counts and performance tradeoffs, supports 90+ languages, and provides both command-line and Python API interfaces. The architecture uses log-Mel spectrograms and autoregressive decoding with sliding 30-second windows, addressing the core problem of accurate, multilingual speech-to-text conversion for applications requiring robust ASR functionality across diverse audio inputs and languages.
