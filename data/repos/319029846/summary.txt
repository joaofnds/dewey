`Depix` is a Python-based proof-of-concept application designed to recover plaintext from pixelized screenshots, specifically those created with a linear box filter. It analyzes pixelized images against a provided search image containing a De Bruijn sequence to identify and reconstruct the original text. Key functionalities include pixel block matching based on color averaging, and the ability to handle images pixelized with different averaging types, as well as optional tools for pixelated image generation and box detection visualization. This standalone command-line application targets users needing to de-pixelize image content, such as researchers, security analysts or reverse engineers.
