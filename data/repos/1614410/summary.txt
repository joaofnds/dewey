FFmpeg is a comprehensive C-based multimedia processing framework that provides low-level libraries and command-line tools for audio/video manipulation, codec implementation, and streaming protocols. The project serves the multimedia, broadcasting, and content creation industries through seven core libraries: libavcodec for codec implementation, libavformat for container formats and streaming protocols, libavutil for utility functions, libavfilter for audio/video filtering, libavdevice for hardware abstraction, libswresample for audio processing, and libswscale for video scaling. It supports major formats including MP4, WebM, Matroska, MPEG, HEVC, and streaming protocols like RTMP, RTSP, and HLS. The toolkit targets multimedia developers, content creators, streaming platform engineers, and system integrators who need robust, production-grade multimedia processing capabilities for transcoding, format conversion, streaming infrastructure, and media analysis workflows.
