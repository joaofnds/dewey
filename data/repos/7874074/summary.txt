Howler.js is a JavaScript audio library designed for the modern web, providing a unified API for handling audio playback across different browsers. It defaults to the Web Audio API but falls back to HTML5 Audio, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and ease of use. Key features include individual and grouped sound control (volume, playback rate, fade, etc.), sound sprite support, 3D spatial audio capabilities, and event-driven programming. This library is primarily intended for front-end developers seeking to incorporate audio functionalities into web applications and games, and it offers various integration methods including npm, Yarn, Bower and CDN, along with examples and a plugin architecture for extending its functionality.
