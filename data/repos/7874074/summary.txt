Howler.js is a JavaScript audio library designed for web developers building audio-enabled web applications. It provides a unified API that abstracts audio playback across browsers by defaulting to the Web Audio API and gracefully falling back to HTML5 Audio elements when necessary. The library handles cross-browser compatibility issues, codec support, and audio edge cases while offering features like sound sprites, spatial audio, volume control, fade effects, and simultaneous multi-track playback. Written in pure JavaScript with no external dependencies, it targets front-end developers working on games, media players, interactive web experiences, and any web application requiring reliable audio functionality across desktop and mobile browsers.
