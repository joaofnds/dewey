Kaf is a modern command-line interface for Apache Kafka written in Go, designed for DevOps engineers and platform administrators managing Kafka clusters. The tool provides kubectl and docker-inspired commands for comprehensive Kafka operations including cluster configuration, topic management, consumer group inspection, message production/consumption, and offset management. It supports multiple installation methods (Go modules, Homebrew, AUR) and features shell autocompletion for major shells. Key functionalities include listing and describing Kafka nodes, topics, and partitions, managing consumer group offsets with granular control over partitions and offset positions (latest, oldest, specific values), and producing messages from stdin. The tool addresses the complexity of Kafka administration by offering an intuitive CLI that abstracts native Kafka tooling into familiar command patterns, targeting system administrators and SREs working with streaming data platforms and event-driven architectures.
