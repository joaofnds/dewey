Apache Airflow is a Python-based platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring data pipelines and workflows. It allows users to define workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks, offering features such as scheduling, execution on workers, dependency management, and a user interface for visualization and troubleshooting. Airflow leverages Jinja templating and includes a wide range of built-in operators, making it suitable for data engineering, data integration, and machine learning pipelines. This is a framework that acts as a workflow-engine for data pipelines.
