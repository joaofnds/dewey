Apache Airflow is a Python-based workflow orchestration platform that enables programmatic authoring, scheduling, and monitoring of data pipelines as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Targeting data engineers, data scientists, and MLOps practitioners, it solves complex workflow dependency management and task scheduling challenges in data engineering and machine learning domains. The platform provides a distributed task execution engine with a web-based UI for pipeline visualization, supports ETL/ELT processes, data integration workflows, and ML pipeline orchestration. Built on Python with extensive integrations for cloud services, databases, and data processing frameworks, Airflow enables scalable automation of batch processing jobs, data transformations, and cross-system data movement workflows in enterprise data infrastructure environments.
