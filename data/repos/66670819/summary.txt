Crawlee is a Node.js web scraping and browser automation library built in TypeScript that provides enterprise-grade crawling capabilities for extracting data from websites. It integrates with multiple automation frameworks including Puppeteer, Playwright, Cheerio, and JSDOM to support both headless and headful browser operations, raw HTTP requests, and DOM parsing. The library targets web developers, data engineers, and AI/ML practitioners who need to build reliable web scrapers for data extraction pipelines, including applications for LLMs, RAG systems, and GPTs. Crawlee addresses anti-bot detection challenges through built-in proxy rotation, human-like crawling patterns, and configurable request handling while providing robust data storage solutions and queue management for large-scale web scraping operations across JavaScript and TypeScript environments.
