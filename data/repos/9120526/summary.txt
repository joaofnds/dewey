`pgx` is a Go library providing a high-performance PostgreSQL driver and toolkit. It offers a low-level, feature-rich interface, supporting PostgreSQL-specific functionalities like `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` and `COPY`, alongside an adapter for the standard `database/sql` interface.  Key features include support for numerous PostgreSQL data types, automatic statement preparation, batch queries, and connection pool management. The toolkit component facilitates parsing the wire protocol and type mapping. This library is designed for Go developers building applications that interact with PostgreSQL databases, offering an alternative to the standard database/sql interface.
