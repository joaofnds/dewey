pgx is a high-performance PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go applications, providing both a native interface and database/sql compatibility for backend developers working with PostgreSQL databases. It implements the PostgreSQL wire protocol with support for approximately 70 PostgreSQL data types, binary format encoding/decoding, connection pooling, automatic statement preparation, batch queries, and PostgreSQL-specific features like LISTEN/NOTIFY, COPY protocol, and logical replication. The toolkit includes modular packages for building custom database proxies, load balancers, and replication clients. Targeting Go developers building PostgreSQL-backed applications, pgx solves performance bottlenecks and feature limitations of generic SQL drivers by exposing native PostgreSQL capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the standard database/sql interface when needed.
