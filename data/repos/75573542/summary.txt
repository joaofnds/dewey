Integrant is a Clojure micro-framework designed for building data-driven applications, functioning as an alternative to Component and Mount. It enables application architecture definition through data configuration, typically loaded from EDN files, rather than code. Key functionalities include initializing and halting application components based on configuration maps, supporting dependency resolution, and offering features like expansions for modularization, profiles for environment-specific configurations, and variable binding. This library provides mechanisms for suspending and resuming application components, along with support for annotations, derived keywords, and composite keys, allowing for advanced system management within Clojure applications.
