Integrant is a Clojure/ClojureScript micro-framework for building applications with data-driven architecture, serving as an alternative to Component and Mount in the Clojure ecosystem. It enables web developers and backend engineers to define application architecture through EDN configuration data rather than programmatic construction, supporting dependency injection and lifecycle management (init/halt/suspend/resume) for system components. The framework provides multimethods for initializing and managing stateful resources like database connections, web servers (Jetty), and handlers, with automatic dependency resolution and proper shutdown ordering. Targeted at Clojure developers building web applications and microservices, Integrant solves the problem of managing complex application state and component dependencies through declarative configuration, making systems more testable and enabling hot-reloading during development while maintaining clean separation between configuration and implementation code.
