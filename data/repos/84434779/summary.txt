`evil-lion` is an Emacs Lisp package providing text alignment operators, mirroring functionality from vim-lion. It offers `gl` and `gL` operators for left and right alignment, respectively, utilizing a character separator for alignment based on regular expressions or major mode-specific rules via align.el. The package enables users to align text within Emacs buffers, including the ability to align on the first occurrence of a character and customize keybindings and space squeezing behavior. Primarily a developer productivity tool, `evil-lion` is intended for Emacs users who utilize the Evil mode.
