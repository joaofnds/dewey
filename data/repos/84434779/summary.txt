**evil-lion** is an Emacs Lisp package that provides text alignment operators for Evil mode (Vim emulation in Emacs), targeting software developers and power users who prefer modal editing. The package implements `gl` (left-align) and `gL` (right-align) operators that work with Vim-style motions and text objects, allowing users to align code and text around specified characters or regular expressions. It integrates with Emacs' built-in align.el library for major-mode-specific alignment rules and supports advanced features like counting occurrences and customizable keybindings. The tool addresses the common development workflow need for consistent code formatting and alignment, particularly useful for aligning variable assignments, configuration files, data structures, and other structured text content within the Emacs editor environment.
