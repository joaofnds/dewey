`org-ros` is an Emacs Lisp plugin designed to facilitate screenshot and image integration within Org-mode files. It allows users to capture screen regions using external screenshot tools (scrot, screencapture, or powershell.exe) and automatically inserts image links into the active Org file. The plugin saves screenshots as PNG files and enables inline image display within the Org-mode environment. It leverages Emacs and external screenshot utilities, targeting users who utilize Org-mode for note-taking and document creation.
