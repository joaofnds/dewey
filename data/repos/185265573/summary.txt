`org-ros` is an Emacs Lisp package that provides cross-platform screenshot capture and automatic linking functionality for Org-mode documents. It addresses the common workflow problem of inserting screenshots into documentation by integrating platform-specific screenshot tools (scrot on Linux, screencapture on macOS, PowerShell on Windows) with Emacs' Org-mode markup system. When invoked, it captures a user-selected screen region, saves it as a timestamped PNG file, automatically inserts an Org-mode image link at the cursor position, and enables inline image display. The tool targets technical writers, developers, and documentation maintainers who use Emacs and Org-mode for creating technical documentation, notes, or knowledge management systems where visual content integration is essential for effective communication.
