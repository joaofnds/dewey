nnn (nÂ³) is a lightweight, high-performance terminal file manager written in C using ncurses for text-based user interfaces. Targeting system administrators, developers, and power users working in CLI environments, it provides disk usage analysis, batch file operations, and extensible plugin architecture for file management workflows. The application runs across POSIX-compliant systems including Linux, macOS, BSD, and embedded platforms like Raspberry Pi and Android (Termux). Built with minimal dependencies and optimized for low memory usage (~3.5MB), it addresses the need for efficient file navigation, search, and manipulation in terminal-based development environments, DevOps workflows, and server administration tasks where GUI file managers are unavailable or impractical.
