Ice Cube is a Ruby library facilitating the creation and querying of recurring date and time schedules, based on the iCalendar specification. It allows developers to define recurrence rules, exception times, and recurrence times using a Ruby-idiomatic API, enabling functionality such as checking for occurrences, retrieving occurrences within a range, and serialization to YAML, ICAL, and hashes. The library supports various recurrence rule types (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, hourly, minutely, secondly) and integrates with ActiveSupport for time zone handling. It is a developer productivity tool aimed at Ruby developers needing to implement complex scheduling logic.
