ice_cube is a Ruby date recurrence library designed for web developers building calendar and scheduling applications. It provides a DSL for creating complex recurring event patterns based on iCalendar RFC standards, enabling developers to define rules like "every Friday the 13th in October" and efficiently query schedules for specific dates or time ranges. The library supports advanced features including exception handling, time zone management through ActiveSupport integration, schedule persistence via to_hash/from_hash serialization, and YAML export capabilities. Primary use cases include appointment systems, event management platforms, and any Ruby/Rails application requiring sophisticated date recurrence logic with fast occurrence lookups and schedule validation.
