libgit2 is a portable C implementation of Git's core functionality provided as a linkable library with a comprehensive API for integrating version control capabilities directly into applications. Targeting software developers across multiple programming languages, it enables GUI clients, hosting providers, DevOps tools, and utilities to programmatically interact with Git repositories without spawning Git processes. Built with CMake and designed for cross-platform compatibility, libgit2 supports language bindings for Ruby, .NET, Python, Node.js, Rust, and other ecosystems through its C interface. The library addresses the need for embedded Git functionality in applications requiring repository manipulation, version control operations, and DVCS integration while maintaining GPL v2 licensing with linking exceptions for proprietary software compatibility.
