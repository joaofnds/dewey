This repository provides a reference implementation for developing AWS Lambda functions in TypeScript with shared dependency layers using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model). It targets serverless/cloud developers working with AWS Lambda who need to optimize deployment efficiency and maintain local development workflows. The project demonstrates TypeScript compilation strategies that preserve file structure without bundling, implements shared layers for third-party dependencies to reduce function size and deployment time, and integrates with AWS SAM CLI for building and deployment. It addresses common challenges in serverless TypeScript development including dependency management, cold start optimization, and maintaining development-production parity. The solution includes unit testing, local debugging capabilities, and CRUD operations with DynamoDB integration, serving as a production-ready template for enterprise serverless applications.
