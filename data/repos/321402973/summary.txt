This repository provides an example project for developing serverless applications on AWS using TypeScript and the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). It demonstrates how to build, test, debug, and deploy AWS Lambda functions with shared layers for dependencies, facilitating local development and faster deployment cycles. Key features include support for TypeScript compilation, integration with the SAM CLI, unit testing, and debugging capabilities. The project employs technologies such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Node.js runtime environment, utilizing AWS SAM for resource definition and deployment, with a focus on maintaining a development experience similar to standard Node.js applications. It functions as a template/example project for developers building serverless applications on the AWS platform.
