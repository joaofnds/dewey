This repository serves as a comprehensive catalog and resource directory for DIY mechanical keyboard enthusiasts and hardware makers. It systematically organizes open-source keyboard designs across multiple form factors including traditional layouts (TKL, 60%, 65%), ergonomic splits (ErgoDox, Atreus), and ortholinear designs (Planck), along with associated PCB files, case designs, and component specifications. The collection targets hardware hobbyists, electrical engineers, and makers interested in custom keyboard development, featuring projects that utilize various microcontrollers (Pro Micro, Arduino-compatible), switch types (MX, Alps, Kailh), and manufacturing approaches from 3D printing to professional PCB fabrication. It addresses the fragmented landscape of mechanical keyboard projects by providing centralized access to design files, firmware resources (primarily QMK), and assembly tutorials for the enthusiast keyboard community.
