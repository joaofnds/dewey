Melody is a Rust-based language that compiles to ECMAScript regular expressions, designed to enhance the readability and maintainability of regular expressions. The project provides a command-line interface (CLI) and a browser-based playground for testing and experimenting with Melody syntax. It features a compiler for translating Melody code into standard regex patterns, along with integrations for VSCode, IntelliJ, NodeJS, Deno, and a Babel plugin for JavaScript environments. Primarily a developer productivity tool, Melody aims to simplify the creation and understanding of regular expressions for tasks such as pattern matching and text processing.
