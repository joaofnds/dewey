DefinitelyTyped is a repository providing high-quality TypeScript type definitions for JavaScript libraries. It functions as a central hub for community-contributed `.d.ts` files, enabling type-checking and improved developer experience when using JavaScript packages within TypeScript projects. The repository supports the creation, testing, and maintenance of these definition files, which are published to npm under the `@types` scope. This project is a critical developer productivity tool used by TypeScript developers who utilize JavaScript libraries to help them with intellisense and preventing common errors.
