DefinitelyTyped is a community-maintained monorepo that provides high-quality TypeScript type definitions (.d.ts files) for JavaScript libraries that lack built-in TypeScript support. Operating as a pnpm-based monorepo, it serves the web development ecosystem by enabling TypeScript developers to use existing JavaScript packages with full type safety and IntelliSense support. The repository contains thousands of @types packages published to npm, covering popular libraries across frontend frameworks, Node.js modules, and web APIs. It addresses the fundamental challenge of bringing static typing to the dynamic JavaScript ecosystem, allowing TypeScript developers to leverage the vast npm package ecosystem while maintaining compile-time type checking. Target users include TypeScript developers, library maintainers, and development teams seeking to integrate JavaScript dependencies into type-safe codebases without sacrificing the benefits of static analysis.
