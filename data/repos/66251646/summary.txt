cl-dino is a Chrome Dinosaur game automation bot implemented in Common Lisp, designed to programmatically play the browser-based T-Rex runner game that appears when Chrome is offline. This project targets the gaming automation and browser automation domain, demonstrating computer vision and automated input techniques for game playing scenarios. The bot likely uses image recognition or screen parsing to detect obstacles and cactuses, then programmatically triggers jump commands to navigate the endless runner gameplay. This represents a practical application of AI game playing concepts and browser automation scripting, primarily serving developers and Common Lisp enthusiasts interested in game automation, computer vision applications, or exploring automated gameplay techniques for educational purposes.
