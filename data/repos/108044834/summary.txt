Container Structure Tests is a Go-based testing framework designed for DevOps and containerization workflows that validates Docker container images through automated structural verification. The tool enables developers and system administrators to perform four types of tests: command execution validation (stdout/stderr output verification), file system existence checks, file content validation, and container metadata verification. It operates as either a standalone binary or Docker image, integrating with CI/CD pipelines to ensure container images meet specified requirements before deployment. The framework uses YAML/JSON configuration files to define test suites and supports regex pattern matching for output validation. Targeted at DevOps engineers, platform teams, and developers working with containerized applications, it addresses the critical need for automated container quality assurance in modern software delivery pipelines.
