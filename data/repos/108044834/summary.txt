`container-structure-test` is a standalone CLI tool, written in Go, designed to validate the structure and content of container images. It allows users to define tests in YAML or JSON files to verify command outputs, file existence and content, and metadata against a specified image. The tool supports multiple drivers, including a Docker-based driver for command execution and a tar-based driver for file system inspection without a Docker daemon, and it integrates with Google Cloud Build and Bazel for automated testing. Primarily aimed at developers and CI/CD pipelines, it provides various output formats, including text, JSON, and JUnit, for reporting test results.
