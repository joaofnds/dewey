This repository provides Google's official Material Design icon sets for cross-platform UI development, serving web developers, mobile app developers (Android/iOS), and designers. It contains two icon collections: Material Symbols (current, variable font-based) and Material Icons (legacy, static). The icons are distributed as SVG files, variable fonts (WOFF2), and icon fonts, with support for customizable design axes including fill, weight, grade, and optical size. Built following Material Design guidelines, the repository addresses the need for consistent, scalable iconography across web applications, mobile apps, and design systems. Developers integrate these icons into React, Angular, Flutter, and native mobile applications, while the variable font technology enables dynamic styling and animation effects for modern UI frameworks.
