`clj-github-mock` is a Clojure library providing a `ring`-compatible handler that emulates a subset of the GitHub API. Its core functionality enables testing applications that interact with the GitHub API by allowing developers to mock API responses. This library is designed to be used with other libraries, such as `clj-http-fake` or `http-kit-fake`, to intercept and simulate HTTP requests to the mocked GitHub API. It targets developers building and testing Clojure applications that integrate with the GitHub API, providing a developer productivity tool.
