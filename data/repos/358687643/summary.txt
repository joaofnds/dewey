`clj-github-mock` is a Clojure-based GitHub API emulator designed for testing GitHub integrations and applications. Built as a Ring-compatible handler, it integrates with various Clojure HTTP servers (http-kit, pedestal) and HTTP mocking libraries (clj-http-fake, http-kit-fake) to simulate GitHub API responses in unit and integration tests. The library addresses the challenge of testing GitHub-dependent applications without making actual API calls, enabling developers to create predictable, offline test environments for webhook handlers, GitHub Apps, and other GitHub API consumers. Targeting Clojure developers building GitHub integrations, it provides a lightweight alternative to external testing dependencies while maintaining compatibility with the Ring ecosystem. The mock server facilitates continuous integration workflows by eliminating GitHub API rate limits and network dependencies during automated testing phases.
