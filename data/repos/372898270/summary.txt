solarized.nvim is a Lua-based colorscheme plugin that ports the classic Solarized theme to Neovim, specifically targeting software developers and text editor customization. Built for Neovim 0.5+, it leverages modern editor features including TreeSitter syntax highlighting, built-in LSP (Language Server Protocol) diagnostics, and Git integration. The plugin provides comprehensive theming support for popular Neovim plugins like Telescope, nvim-tree, Lualine, BufferLine, and various LSP-related tools. It addresses the need for consistent visual theming across the modern Neovim ecosystem while maintaining compatibility with the widely-adopted Solarized color palette. Key features include configurable italic styling, contrast adjustments for sidebars, live theme switching capabilities, and terminal transparency options, making it suitable for developers seeking a cohesive, professionally-styled development environment.
