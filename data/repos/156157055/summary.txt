This repository is a comprehensive MLOps educational platform that teaches production-grade machine learning application development through hands-on implementation. Built primarily with Jupyter Notebooks and Python, it covers the complete ML lifecycle from experimentation to deployment using PyTorch for deep learning, Ray for distributed computing, and various MLOps tools for orchestration and monitoring. The course focuses on natural language processing applications while emphasizing software engineering best practices, data quality assurance, distributed training, and CI/CD workflows. It targets software engineers transitioning to ML, data scientists seeking production skills, and technical leaders wanting to understand ML system architecture. The curriculum bridges the gap between academic ML concepts and industry requirements by demonstrating scalable, reliable ML systems with proper testing, monitoring, and deployment practices using modern cloud-native technologies.
