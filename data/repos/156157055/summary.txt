`Made-With-ML` is a comprehensive, Jupyter Notebook-based project designed to teach the design, development, deployment, and iteration of production-grade machine learning applications. It leverages Python and key libraries like PyTorch and Ray for data engineering, deep learning, natural language processing, and MLOps tasks, including distributed training, tuning, and deployment. The project encompasses example code, training scripts, and deployment configurations for building end-to-end ML systems. This is an educational resource and example project, with a primary focus on demonstrating best practices and providing a practical, hands-on learning experience for developers, college graduates, and product/leadership personnel interested in applying ML.
