factory_bot is a Ruby testing library that serves as a fixtures replacement for generating test data objects in Ruby applications, particularly Rails web applications. It provides a declarative DSL for defining object factories with support for multiple build strategies including saved instances, unsaved instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects. The library enables factory inheritance and multiple factory definitions per class, allowing developers to create complex test scenarios with minimal code duplication. Targeted at Ruby/Rails developers writing automated tests, factory_bot integrates with testing frameworks like RSpec and addresses the common problem of maintaining clean, readable test data setup while avoiding brittle fixture files that break when database schemas change.
