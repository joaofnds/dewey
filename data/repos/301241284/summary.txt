This repository provides a production-ready Dockerfile template and comprehensive best practices guide for DevOps engineers and developers building secure, containerized applications. It addresses critical security and operational issues in Docker container deployment by implementing non-root user execution with UIDs above 10,000, static UID/GID assignment (10000:10001), proper signal handling via tini process manager, and image tag pinning strategies. The template covers container security hardening, Kubernetes deployment compatibility, OCI compliance, and DNS resolution fixes for legacy Docker versions. It targets system administrators and DevOps professionals who need to deploy production-worthy containers while avoiding common security vulnerabilities like privilege escalation and UID conflicts that plague many Docker images in production environments.
