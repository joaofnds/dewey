This JavaScript project visualizes the visual similarity of Fortune 500 company logos using machine learning techniques. It leverages `d3js` for data visualization and implements a `tsne` algorithm for dimensionality reduction to map logo similarities. The project is a web application, accessible via a development server and build script, allowing users to explore logo relationships within the Fortune 500 data.
