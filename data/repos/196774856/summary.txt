This repository implements a data visualization application that analyzes visual similarity patterns in Fortune 500 company logos using machine learning dimensionality reduction techniques. Built with JavaScript and D3.js for interactive web-based visualization, the project applies t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) algorithms to map logo design features into a explorable 2D space where visually similar logos cluster together. The computational design approach targets data scientists, visualization researchers, and design analysts interested in quantifying corporate visual identity patterns through unsupervised learning. The web application serves as both an analytical tool for understanding logo design trends across major corporations and a demonstration of applying machine learning to visual design analysis in the corporate branding domain.
