`core.matrix` is a Clojure library providing a standardized API for multi-dimensional array programming, primarily focused on numerical computing. It enables idiomatic and performant matrix and array operations within the Clojure environment, supporting various backend implementations like `vectorz-clj`, `Clatrix`, and `nd4clj` for optimized numerical computation. The library facilitates pluggable support for different matrix libraries and provides a foundation for other projects in the Clojure ecosystem, including Clojurescript support through `aljabr`. This project is a library designed to extend Clojure with array programming capabilities, aimed at developers working with numerical data and matrix computations.
