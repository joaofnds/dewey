core.matrix is a Clojure library that provides a comprehensive API for multi-dimensional array and matrix programming, primarily targeting numerical computing and data science applications. Built as a pluggable abstraction layer, it enables seamless integration with multiple backend implementations including vectorz-clj (pure JVM), Clatrix (BLAS-native), NDArray (pure Clojure), and nd4clj (GPU-accelerated via Nd4j). The library supports both Clojure and ClojureScript environments, offering idiomatic functional programming approaches for linear algebra operations, matrix transformations, and n-dimensional array manipulations. It serves as foundational infrastructure for scientific computing frameworks like Incanter, addressing the need for standardized, high-performance numerical operations in the Clojure ecosystem for data scientists and numerical computing developers.
