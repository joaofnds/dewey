Viper is a comprehensive configuration management library for Go applications that provides a unified interface for handling application settings from multiple sources. It supports reading configuration data from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, INI, envfile, and Java properties files, environment variables, command-line flags, remote key-value stores (etcd/Consul), and programmatic defaults with a defined precedence hierarchy. The library targets Go developers building cloud-native applications, microservices, and 12-Factor apps who need flexible configuration management without being tied to specific file formats. Viper handles live configuration reloading, type marshalling/unmarshalling, and provides case-insensitive key access, making it particularly valuable for DevOps workflows and containerized applications where configuration needs to be externalized and dynamically managed across different deployment environments.
