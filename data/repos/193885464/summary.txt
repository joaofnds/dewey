`blurhash` is a C library providing a compact, placeholder representation for images. It enables the generation and decoding of a highly compressed hash string that approximates an image, allowing for the display of a blurred preview before the full image loads. This library facilitates the creation of visually pleasing loading experiences and is likely targeted toward developers integrating image handling functionalities within applications and web pages, functioning as a standalone library. Its core domain is image processing and front-end development for improved user experience.
