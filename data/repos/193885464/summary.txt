BlurHash is a C-based algorithm implementation that generates compact 20-30 character string representations of image placeholders for improving UI loading experiences. The repository provides encoding functionality that analyzes images and produces short hash strings that can be decoded client-side into blurred placeholder images while actual images load over the network. Targeting web and mobile developers across frontend, backend, and full-stack domains, BlurHash addresses the common UX problem of empty image containers during network loading by enabling lightweight placeholder generation that fits within JSON payloads and database schemas. The core C implementation has been ported to numerous languages including Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, Python, and others, making it accessible across web development, mobile app development, and API design workflows where image loading optimization is critical.
