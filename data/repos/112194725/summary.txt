`faktory_cron` is a Go-based scheduling service that extends the Faktory job queue system by adding cron-like scheduling capabilities. Built for DevOps and backend infrastructure teams, it allows system administrators and developers to define recurring job schedules using YAML configuration files with traditional cron syntax or interval-based scheduling (@every, @daily, etc.). The tool connects to Faktory work servers via TCP, queuing jobs with configurable parameters including retries, priority levels, and queue assignments. It addresses the gap in Faktory's native scheduling functionality by providing a lightweight, standalone binary that can run as a service or Docker container, enabling automated task execution for background job processing systems in distributed applications and microservice architectures.
