`faktory-cron` is a Go-based, standalone command-line application providing a cron/scheduling service for the Faktory job server. It enables users to schedule jobs to be sent to a Faktory instance using a cron-like syntax defined in a YAML configuration file.  Key functionalities include job scheduling with configurable options like retries, queue selection, and priority, as well as support for interval-based scheduling. The project is designed as a developer productivity tool, intended to automate Faktory job execution based on recurring schedules. It can be deployed using Docker.
