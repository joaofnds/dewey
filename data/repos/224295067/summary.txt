Vest is a TypeScript-based declarative validation framework for web development that provides form validation capabilities across multiple JavaScript frameworks including React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular. It employs a unit testing-inspired syntax using `test()` and `enforce()` functions to define validation rules, separating validation logic from UI components. The framework handles complex validation scenarios including asynchronous validations, conditional logic, and stateful validation management. Designed for frontend developers building web applications with complex forms, Vest addresses the maintainability and scalability challenges of traditional form validation approaches by providing a framework-agnostic solution that can be integrated into existing codebases without coupling to specific UI libraries, reducing code bloat and improving validation logic reusability.
