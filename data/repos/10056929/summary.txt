PragmataPro is a repository focused on the development and improvement of the PragmataPro typeface family, a monospaced and modular-spaced font optimized for coding, mathematics, and engineering. It provides a rich set of glyphs, including support for numerous character sets like Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, and mathematical symbols, alongside ligatures and IPA symbols. The project aims to gather user feedback and suggestions for refining the font, which is available in regular, bold, italic, and bold italic styles, as well as a variable font version. This project is a resource for users of the font to contribute and provide feedback to improve the quality of the typeface.
