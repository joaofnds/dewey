Bubblewrap is a low-level sandboxing tool written in C that provides unprivileged containerization capabilities for Linux systems. It creates secure execution environments using Linux namespaces (mount, PID, network, IPC, UTS) and seccomp filters without requiring root privileges, addressing the security risks of traditional container runtimes when used by unprivileged users. The tool serves as foundational infrastructure for application sandboxing frameworks like Flatpak, rpm-ostree, and desktop application isolation systems. It implements a setuid-based subset of user namespaces functionality, creating isolated filesystem environments with tmpfs-based root filesystems and granular bind mounting controls. Target users include system administrators, container platform developers, and security-focused application distribution systems requiring safe, unprivileged process isolation in Linux environments.
