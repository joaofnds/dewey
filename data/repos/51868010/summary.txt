Bubblewrap is a low-level, unprivileged sandboxing tool written in C, designed primarily to provide secure execution environments for unprivileged users within Linux containers. Its core functionality centers on creating isolated environments via user namespaces and mount namespaces, enabling the creation of sandboxes with restricted access to the host system. Bubblewrap achieves this by creating a new, empty mount namespace, where the root is on a tmpfs. Key features include the ability to control filesystem visibility, user and IPC namespaces, PID namespaces, network namespaces, and UTS namespaces, along with Seccomp filters. The project is a standalone CLI tool intended for use by other container runtime tools like Flatpak to enhance their security, and is applicable to system administrators and developers focused on containerization and application sandboxing.
