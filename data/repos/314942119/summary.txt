emacs-webkit is a C-based dynamic module that embeds a full WebKit browser engine directly into Emacs, targeting power users and developers who want unified text editing and web browsing workflows. Built using WebKitGTK2 and Emacs' dynamic module API, it serves as an alternative to the existing xwidget-webkit implementation, providing enhanced browser functionality within the Emacs environment. The module addresses the problem of context switching between text editors and browsers for developers and heavy Emacs users who prefer keyboard-driven interfaces. It integrates WebKit's multiprocess architecture with Emacs' display system, supporting both embedded browser views and standalone windows, while maintaining security isolation between web content and Emacs Lisp execution contexts.
