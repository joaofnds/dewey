class-transformer is a TypeScript library that provides decorator-based transformation between plain JavaScript objects and ES6 class instances for web development applications. It solves the common problem of converting JSON data from APIs, files, or network requests into properly typed class objects with accessible methods and properties. The library offers bidirectional transformation capabilities through methods like `plainToInstance` and `instanceToPlain`, supporting complex scenarios including nested objects, property filtering, serialization control, and type-safe conversions. Targeted at TypeScript/JavaScript developers working on frontend and backend applications, it enables seamless object-oriented programming patterns when handling external data sources, particularly useful in Angular, Node.js, and full-stack development where maintaining type safety and class functionality across data boundaries is crucial.
