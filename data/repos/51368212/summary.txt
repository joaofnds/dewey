`class-transformer` is a TypeScript library designed for transforming plain JavaScript objects into class instances and vice-versa, enabling serialization and deserialization based on defined criteria. It operates within the domain of object-oriented programming, providing a decorator-based approach to map data structures, particularly useful for handling JSON data from backends or APIs in both frontend and backend applications. Key functionalities include `plainToInstance` for converting plain objects to class instances, `instanceToPlain` for serialization, and features like property exclusion, versioning, and grouping for controlling data exposure. This library is a developer productivity tool, specifically a library, that leverages TypeScript and decorators for improved type safety and object transformation within JavaScript/TypeScript projects.
