Lispyville is an Emacs Lisp package that bridges Evil (Vim emulation) and Lispy editing modes to provide structure-aware Lisp code editing for Vim-oriented developers. It implements "safe" versions of Evil's yank, delete, and change operators that preserve parenthetical balance, along with specialized motions, text objects, and commands optimized for S-expression manipulation. The package addresses the fundamental incompatibility between Vim's line-oriented editing paradigm and Lisp's nested syntactic structure, preventing operators like `dd` from breaking parenthetical balance. Targeting Emacs users who prefer Vim keybindings but work with Lisp dialects (Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, Clojure), it serves as an alternative to evil-cleverparens by leveraging Lispy's contextual command system rather than smartparens or paredit for structural editing operations.
