Folktale is a JavaScript standard library that provides functional programming primitives and algebraic data types for web and Node.js development. Built for ECMAScript 2015+ environments with backward compatibility to ES3, it offers developers immutable data structures, monadic operations, and composable functional utilities to replace imperative JavaScript patterns. The library targets JavaScript developers seeking to implement functional programming paradigms in frontend applications, Node.js services, and full-stack web development projects. By providing standardized implementations of concepts like Maybe, Either, and other algebraic data types, Folktale enables developers to write more predictable, testable code with better error handling and data transformation capabilities compared to traditional object-oriented JavaScript approaches.
