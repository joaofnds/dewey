city-roads is a web-based geospatial visualization tool that renders comprehensive road networks for any city using JavaScript and WebGL. The application fetches road data from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API and leverages Nominatim for location resolution, with a pre-indexed cache of 3,000+ major cities stored in protobuf format for performance optimization. Built for cartographers, urban planners, and data visualization developers, it transforms raw OSM road segment data into interactive browser-based renderings. The tool addresses the challenge of visualizing complex urban infrastructure at scale, though performance is constrained by browser memory limits for very large datasets. It includes a scripting API for programmatic access, enabling developers to build custom geospatial applications on top of the core visualization engine.
