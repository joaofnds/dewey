`city-roads` is a JavaScript web application designed for visualizing road networks within cities. It fetches road data from OpenStreetMap using the overpass API and, for performance, caches data for approximately 3,000 cities in a protobuf format. The application resolves city names via nominatim and offers a search interface for users to select a city for rendering. The project includes scripting capabilities through a scene API, allowing for programmatic interaction, and is built using Node.js tooling, supporting local development and production builds, with a focus on visual presentation of large datasets.
