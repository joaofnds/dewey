VSCodium is a Shell script-driven project that automates the build process for freely licensed binaries of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor. It clones the official `vscode` repository, removes Microsoft branding, telemetry, and proprietary licenses, and generates builds under the MIT license. Core functionality includes the creation of cross-platform binaries (macOS, Linux, and Windows) packaged for various distribution methods like Brew, WinGet, Snap, and package managers. This project acts as a build automation tool and provides pre-built, community-driven versions of the popular code editor for developers seeking an open-source and telemetry-free alternative to the official VS Code releases.
