VSCodium is a community-driven build automation project that compiles Microsoft's open-source Visual Studio Code repository into freely-distributable binaries stripped of proprietary Microsoft branding, telemetry, and licensing restrictions. Built primarily with Shell scripts and GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows, it targets cross-platform environments (Linux, macOS, Windows) and provides automated builds for both stable and insider releases. The project addresses licensing and privacy concerns for developers who want the full VS Code IDE functionality without Microsoft's data collection or proprietary licensing terms. It serves software developers across all domains who require a truly open-source code editor while maintaining complete compatibility with VS Code's extension ecosystem and feature set, distributed through multiple package managers including Homebrew, Chocolatey, Snap, and traditional package repositories.
