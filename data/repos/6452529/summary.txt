RethinkDB is an open-source distributed NoSQL database system implemented in C++ specifically designed for realtime web applications. It stores schemaless JSON documents and provides a unique "changefeed" feature that continuously pushes updated query results to applications without requiring polling, enabling live data synchronization. The database targets web developers building realtime applications like collaborative tools, live dashboards, chat systems, and streaming data interfaces. RethinkDB offers automatic failover, horizontal scaling, and high availability through its distributed architecture. It provides official drivers for JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java, plus community drivers for languages like Go, C#, and Rust. The system addresses the specific problem of building responsive web applications that require instant data propagation across multiple clients without the overhead of constant database polling.
