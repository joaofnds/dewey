Apache Superset is an open-source business intelligence web application built on Flask (Python backend) and React (frontend) for data visualization and exploration. It serves data analysts, data scientists, and business users by providing a no-code chart builder, web-based SQL editor, and interactive dashboard creation capabilities. The platform connects to SQL databases and data engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, Presto, etc.) via SQLAlchemy, offering a semantic layer for defining custom metrics and dimensions. Superset addresses the need for accessible BI tooling by combining programmatic SQL querying with drag-and-drop visualization creation, featuring extensible authentication, caching layers, REST APIs, and cloud-native architecture for enterprise data analytics workflows.
