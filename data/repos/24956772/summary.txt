Hammerspoon is a macOS desktop automation framework that bridges system APIs with Lua scripting capabilities. Built primarily in Objective-C, it provides a comprehensive extension system that exposes macOS functionality—including window management, application control, system events, and hardware interfaces—to Lua scripts. The tool targets power users, system administrators, and developers who need programmatic control over their macOS environment beyond standard AppleScript limitations. Users write custom Lua configurations in `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua` to automate repetitive tasks, create custom keyboard shortcuts, manage application workflows, and integrate system-level operations. Originally forked from the minimal Mjolnir project, Hammerspoon offers a more integrated experience with tighter extension coupling and broader API coverage for comprehensive macOS automation workflows.
