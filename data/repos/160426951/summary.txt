The `MicrosoftEdge/MSEdge` repository details Microsoft's intention to adopt the Chromium open-source project for its desktop Edge browser, aiming for improved web compatibility and reduced fragmentation. This involves aligning Edge's web platform with Chromium's, enabling cross-platform distribution (including macOS) and offering Windows platform expertise to enhance Chromium-based browser performance. Key focus areas for Microsoft's contributions include ARM64 support, accessibility features using Microsoft UI Automation, advancements in modern input handling, and security enhancements. The project is a browser platform, intended for end-users, developers, and IT managers, utilizing a C++ based architecture through Chromium, along with integration of Windows-specific technologies.
