This repository documents Microsoft's strategic decision to adopt Chromium open source as the foundation for Microsoft Edge desktop browser development. Targeting the web browser and web platform domain, it outlines Microsoft's transition from their proprietary EdgeHTML engine to Chromium's Blink rendering engine and V8 JavaScript engine. The initiative addresses web compatibility fragmentation issues, slow update cycles tied to Windows release schedules, and developer pain points with cross-browser testing. Primary stakeholders include Chromium maintainers, browser engine developers, web developers, and enterprise IT managers. The document establishes Microsoft's commitment to becoming a significant Chromium contributor while maintaining competitive browser diversity, focusing on ARM-based Windows device support and improved web standards compatibility across the broader web ecosystem.
