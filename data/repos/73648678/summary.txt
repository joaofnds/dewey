Forem is an open-source Ruby on Rails community platform application that powers developer-focused social networks like DEV.to. Built with a Rails backend and transitioning to a Preact frontend, it provides a complete content management and discussion system for technical communities. The platform enables developers to publish articles, engage in threaded discussions, build professional profiles, and participate in knowledge-sharing forums. Targeting software development communities and technical organizations, Forem addresses the need for specialized social platforms that combine blogging, forums, and professional networking features. The codebase serves platform operators, community managers, and Ruby/Rails developers who want to deploy and customize community-driven websites for developer audiences, offering an alternative to general-purpose social media platforms.
