`nerdsJS` is a JavaScript library providing a programmatic API for generating mock data from various "nerdy" topics like movies, TV shows, and hobbies, specifically targeting data for testing and development. It allows users to retrieve data in array, promise, or generator formats, with methods for topic resolution, field selection (including `include` and `exclude`), and result formatting (`asArray`, `asPromise`, `asGenerator`). The project's architecture is designed around method chaining for building data queries and is a developer-focused library leveraging JavaScript for API interaction and data retrieval.
