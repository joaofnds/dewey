nerdsJS is a JavaScript/Node.js mock data generation library designed for web developers who need themed placeholder content during application development and testing. The API provides programmatic access to fictional datasets from popular franchises including Pokemon, Harry Potter, and Star Wars, enabling developers to generate random structured data through a fluent chainable interface. Built as an npm package, it offers multiple output formats (Arrays, Promises, Generators) and supports field filtering through include/exclude methods for precise data composition. The library primarily serves frontend and backend JavaScript developers building prototypes, demos, or applications requiring realistic-looking test data with familiar pop culture references, eliminating the need for generic Lorem Ipsum content in development workflows.
