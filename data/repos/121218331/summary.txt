Oz is a Clojure/ClojureScript data visualization library that bridges the Grammar of Graphics-based Vega and Vega-Lite declarative visualization specifications with Clojure's ecosystem. It provides a REPL-driven development experience for data scientists and Clojure developers, offering functions to render interactive visualizations in browsers via WebSocket (`view!`), create GitHub gist-based sharing (`publish!`), export static HTML files, and integrate with Jupyter notebooks through Clojupyter and IClojure kernels. The library includes Reagent components for ClojureScript applications, live-reload capabilities for iterative data exploration, and static site generation for scientific documents. Oz targets data scientists and developers working in the data visualization domain who prefer functional programming paradigms over imperative plotting libraries, enabling declarative specification of how data attributes map to visual properties.
