`oz` is a Clojure and ClojureScript library facilitating data visualization and scientific document processing using Vega and Vega-Lite. It provides a REPL API (`view!`) and Reagent components for interactive visualizations in Clojure and ClojureScript applications, along with features for sharing visualizations via GitHub Gists (`publish!`) and static site generation.  Key functionalities include loading data and specifications from various formats, exporting interactive HTML files, and supporting Jupyter notebooks via Clojupyter and IClojure kernels.  The library utilizes Clojure, ClojureScript, Vega, and Vega-Lite, and targets data scientists and developers seeking to create data-driven documents and visualizations.
