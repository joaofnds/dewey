Phoenix is a web application framework built on Elixir and the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM) designed for building scalable, fault-tolerant web applications and API servers. It targets web developers and backend engineers who need to create real-time, distributed web systems with high concurrency and low latency requirements. The framework leverages Elixir's actor model and lightweight processes to handle millions of concurrent connections, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring WebSocket connections, live updates, and soft real-time features. Phoenix provides MVC architecture patterns, built-in WebSocket support through Phoenix Channels, and integrates with Phoenix LiveView for server-rendered interactive applications, positioning itself as an alternative to traditional web frameworks for developers building modern, concurrent web applications that need to scale from prototype to production environments.
