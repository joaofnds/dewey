This repository contains the source code and content for "The Rust Programming Language" book, the official comprehensive guide to the Rust programming language. Built using mdBook (a Rust-based static site generator for technical documentation), it serves the systems programming and software development domain by providing structured learning materials for developers transitioning to Rust or learning memory-safe systems programming. The repository includes custom mdbook plugins for enhanced functionality, automated testing of code examples, and build tools to generate both web-based and print-ready versions of the documentation. It targets software engineers, systems programmers, and developers interested in performance-critical applications, concurrent programming, and memory safety, addressing the need for authoritative learning resources in the growing Rust ecosystem.
