This repository contains the documentation source files for the Luminus web framework, a Clojure-based full-stack web development framework. It serves as the codebase for the official documentation website (luminusweb.net), providing comprehensive guides, tutorials, and reference materials for web developers building server-side applications with Clojure. The repository primarily consists of static site generation assets including CSS stylesheets, markdown documentation files, and web templates that are compiled into the framework's official documentation portal. Luminus targets JVM-based web development, offering opinionated project templates and integrations for common web application components like databases, authentication, and deployment. The documentation addresses Clojure web developers who need guidance on building production web applications using functional programming paradigms on the JVM platform.
