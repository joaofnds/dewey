perfect-freehand is a JavaScript library that generates smooth, pressure-sensitive stroke outlines for digital drawing applications. It takes an array of input points (from mouse/stylus movement) and produces polygon outline points that form natural-looking variable-width strokes, supporting both simulated and real pressure data from drawing tablets. The core `getStroke` function processes input coordinates through spline interpolation and outline generation algorithms, with configurable parameters for size, thinning, smoothing, and streamline effects. Designed for web developers building drawing interfaces, digital art tools, or note-taking applications, it integrates with HTML Canvas, SVG, and other rendering technologies. The library addresses the complex mathematical challenge of converting raw pointer input into aesthetically pleasing brush strokes that mimic traditional drawing tools in web-based graphics applications.
