`perfect-freehand` is an HTML-based JavaScript library for drawing pressure-sensitive, variable-width freehand lines, strokes, and shapes within graphics contexts like HTML Canvas and SVG. Its core functionality centers on the `getStroke` function, which generates outline points from input point arrays (typically representing mouse or stylus input), enabling the rendering of dynamic and customizable strokes with pressure simulation and advanced tapering options. The library leverages HTML, JavaScript, and associated technologies such as SVG path manipulation to generate and render vector-based drawings with features like smoothing, streamlining, and the ability to integrate with tools like Figma. The project is a drawing library, providing functionalities such as generating SVG paths from the stroke points which targets frontend developers.
