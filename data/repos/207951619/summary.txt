`choose` is a command-line text processing utility written in Rust that serves as a human-friendly alternative to the Unix `cut` and `awk` commands for field extraction and text manipulation. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and shell users, it provides Python-like slice syntax for selecting fields from delimited text, supporting features like negative indexing, regex field separators, and zero-based indexing. Built with Rust's regex crate for pattern matching, the tool optimizes performance for text processing pipelines while offering more intuitive syntax than traditional Unix text utilities. It addresses the complexity and verbosity of `awk` scripting and `cut` parameter configuration, providing a streamlined interface for common field selection tasks in shell scripting and data extraction workflows.
