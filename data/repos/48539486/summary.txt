**crux** is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a curated collection of interactive commands to enhance the Emacs text editor experience for developers and power users. The package addresses common text editing inefficiencies by bundling utility functions for file management (`crux-delete-file-and-buffer`, `crux-rename-file-and-buffer`), smart text manipulation (`crux-smart-kill-line`, `crux-duplicate-current-line-or-region`), buffer operations (`crux-kill-other-buffers`, `crux-cleanup-buffer-or-region`), and system integration (`crux-open-with`, `crux-reopen-as-root`). Originally extracted from the Emacs Prelude configuration framework and Emacs Redux blog posts, crux targets Emacs users across all development domains who want to streamline their editor workflow without configuring individual utility functions. The package integrates with Emacs' built-in package management system and requires manual keybinding configuration, making it suitable for experienced Emacs users seeking productivity enhancements.
