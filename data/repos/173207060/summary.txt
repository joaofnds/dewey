ytt is a Go-based YAML templating tool designed for DevOps and Kubernetes configuration management that operates on YAML structure rather than text-based templating. It integrates Starlark (Python-like) programming language for complex configuration logic, supports data value injection, overlay mechanisms for customization, and provides sandboxed template execution. The tool addresses configuration management challenges in container orchestration environments by enabling reusable, validated YAML templates with structural awareness to avoid common text-templating issues like quoting and indentation errors. Target users include DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and Kubernetes administrators who need to manage complex, environment-specific YAML configurations across multiple deployments while maintaining template reusability and validation capabilities.
