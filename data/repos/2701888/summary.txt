Kakoune is a modal text editor implemented in C++20 that serves as an alternative to Vim for software developers and programmers. It implements Vi's keystroke-based text editing paradigm but introduces multiple selections as a core interaction model, allowing simultaneous editing of multiple text regions. The editor operates in normal and insertion modes, features a client-server architecture for collaborative editing sessions, and provides advanced text manipulation primitives including regex-based selection filtering, text objects, and external program integration. Built for Unix-like environments (Linux, macOS, Cygwin), it targets developers seeking efficient code editing with fewer keystrokes than traditional editors, offering syntax highlighting, auto-completion, macros, and hooks for customization across various programming languages and development workflows.
