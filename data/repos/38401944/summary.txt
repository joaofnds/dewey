emacs-which-key is an Emacs Lisp minor mode package that provides contextual keybinding discovery for Emacs text editor users. It displays available key combinations in real-time popup windows after users enter incomplete command prefixes (like C-x), helping navigate Emacs' complex keybinding system. The package targets Emacs power users, developers, and system administrators who work extensively within the Emacs ecosystem for text editing, programming, and system configuration. Built entirely in Emacs Lisp, it integrates with third-party Emacs packages like evil-mode, god-mode, and key-chord, offering customizable popup positioning (minibuffer, side windows), sorting options, and visual theming. The tool solves the discoverability problem inherent in Emacs' extensive keyboard-driven interface, reducing the learning curve for intermediate users transitioning to advanced Emacs workflows. It's now archived as it has been incorporated into Emacs core for version 30.
