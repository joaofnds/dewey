Failsafe-go is a fault tolerance library for Go applications that implements resilience patterns through composable policy wrappers around functions. It provides eight core resilience policies: Retry for transient failure handling, CircuitBreaker for cascading failure prevention, RateLimiter for traffic control, Timeout for execution bounds, Fallback for graceful degradation, Hedge for latency optimization through parallel requests, Bulkhead for resource isolation, and Cache for response optimization. The library targets backend developers building distributed systems, microservices, and cloud-native applications where network calls, database operations, and external service integrations require robust error handling. By wrapping existing Go functions with these policies, developers can implement enterprise-grade resilience patterns without architectural changes, addressing common distributed system challenges like network partitions, service degradation, and resource contention in production environments.
