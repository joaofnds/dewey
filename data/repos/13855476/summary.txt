GORM is a full-featured Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Go programming language, designed to simplify database interactions in web development and backend applications. It provides comprehensive database abstraction with support for associations (Has One/Many, Belongs To, Many-to-Many), automated migrations, transaction management, eager loading, and SQL query building. The library features advanced capabilities including hooks for CRUD operations, batch processing, connection pooling, and a plugin architecture for extensions like database sharding and monitoring integration. GORM targets Go developers building web applications, APIs, and microservices who need efficient database operations without writing raw SQL, supporting multiple database engines through driver abstraction while maintaining type safety and developer productivity.
