GORM is a feature-rich ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for the Go programming language, designed to simplify database interactions for developers. It provides functionalities like associations (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many), hooks, eager loading, transactions, and SQL building capabilities, including upsert and locking. This library facilitates database schema migrations, logging, and supports an extendable plugin API for database resolver and Prometheus integration. GORM serves as a developer-friendly framework, streamlining database operations for backend development within Go applications.
