Monitoror is a Go-based unified monitoring wallboard application designed for DevOps and system administration environments. It provides a centralized dashboard for monitoring server status, CI/CD pipeline builds, and critical system metrics through a web-based interface. The application follows a client-server architecture with a Go HTTP API backend (Core) that aggregates monitoring data and a browser-based frontend (UI) that displays real-time status information on monitoring wallboards. Built for cross-platform deployment on Linux, macOS, and Windows, Monitoror addresses the need for consolidated visual monitoring of distributed infrastructure and development workflows. The tool targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and development teams who require persistent, ergonomic monitoring displays for operational awareness and incident response in modern software development and deployment environments.
