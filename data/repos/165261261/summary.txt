Monitoror is a Go-based standalone application designed as a unified monitoring wallboard, providing a light and ergonomic interface for displaying server status, CI build progress, and critical metrics. It consists of a server-side HTTP API (Core) and a client-side UI (wallboard), configurable via environment variables or a `.env` file. The application targets system administrators and developers needing a readily available dashboard for real-time operational visibility, leveraging Go and JavaScript (implied by mentions of NodeJS and a UI). The project allows users to monitor any system that exposes data and provides a visual display.
