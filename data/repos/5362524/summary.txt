Source Code Pro is an open-source monospaced OpenType font family specifically engineered for coding environments and user interfaces. Built using Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO), it provides comprehensive font formats including TTF, OTF, and variable fonts to ensure cross-platform compatibility across development tools, IDEs, terminals, and text editors. The repository contains source files and build instructions for generating production-ready fonts optimized for programming syntax highlighting, code readability, and extended coding sessions. Targeting software developers, UI/UX designers, and system administrators, it addresses the critical need for highly legible, distinguishable character rendering in monospaced contexts where character confusion can lead to coding errors, particularly in web development, software engineering, and terminal-based workflows.
