Proto Actor Go is a distributed actor model framework designed for building concurrent and distributed systems in Go, with cross-platform compatibility for C# and Java/Kotlin environments. Built on Protocol Buffers for serialization and gRPC streams for network transport, it implements the actor pattern for decoupled concurrency, fault tolerance, and distributed computing scenarios. The framework targets backend developers and distributed systems engineers working on high-performance, scalable applications that require message-passing concurrency primitives. It provides clustering capabilities, remote actor communication, and persistence layers while emphasizing minimal API design and performance optimization. The system is particularly suited for microservices architectures, real-time systems, and applications requiring actor-based concurrency models similar to Akka but with cross-language interoperability and modern networking protocols.
