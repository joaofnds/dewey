`protoactor-go` is a Go implementation of the Proto Actor framework, designed for building ultra-fast, distributed, and cross-platform actor systems. This library facilitates concurrent and distributed computing through the actor model, offering features such as actor supervision, lifecycle events, and networking based on gRPC and Protocol Buffers for efficient message serialization and remoting. It provides a minimalistic API with a focus on building upon existing technologies, enabling fault tolerance, scalability, and cross-platform interoperability between Go and C# actor systems, and targets developers building high-performance, distributed applications. This is a library.
