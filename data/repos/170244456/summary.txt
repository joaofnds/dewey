Hidden is a lightweight macOS utility application built in Swift that provides menu bar management functionality for Mac users. The application operates within the macOS desktop productivity domain, specifically targeting menu bar organization and visual decluttering. It utilizes native macOS APIs and Swift frameworks to integrate directly with the system menu bar, allowing users to selectively hide and show menu bar icons through a simple toggle interface. The tool addresses the common problem of menu bar overcrowding that occurs when multiple applications install persistent menu bar items, creating visual noise and consuming limited menu bar space. Target users include Mac power users, developers, and productivity-focused individuals who run multiple applications with menu bar components and seek to maintain a cleaner desktop environment while preserving quick access to essential tools.
