Kino is an Elixir library that provides client-driven interactive widgets for Livebook, a collaborative notebook environment. It enables developers and data scientists to render rich, interactive visualizations and user interface components directly from Elixir code within notebook cells. The library serves as the core rendering engine for Livebook's output system, supporting data visualization through Vega-Lite charts, interactive forms, and dynamic content display. Kino addresses the need for interactive data exploration and presentation in the Elixir ecosystem, complementing the language's strengths in concurrent and distributed systems. It targets Elixir developers working in data science, machine learning, and exploratory programming contexts, with an extensible architecture supporting specialized packages for database integration, mapping, benchmarking, and machine learning frameworks like Bumblebee and Explorer.
