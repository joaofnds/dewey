**sttr** is a cross-platform CLI tool written in Go that provides developers and system administrators with a comprehensive suite of string transformation operations through both command-line arguments and interactive TUI modes. The tool addresses the common developer workflow problem of needing quick access to encoding/decoding (Base64, ASCII85, URL, HTML), hashing (MD5, SHA variants), encryption, JSON/YAML conversion, text manipulation, and case transformation operations without context-switching to online tools or writing custom scripts. Built for developer productivity in DevOps and web development environments, it supports multiple input methods including direct arguments, file processing, stdin piping, and output redirection, enabling seamless integration into shell workflows and automation scripts. The Go-based implementation ensures fast execution and easy distribution across Unix, Windows, and mobile (Termux) environments.
