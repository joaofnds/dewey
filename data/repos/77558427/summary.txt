This JavaScript repository provides implementations and explanations of data structures and algorithms, functioning as an educational resource and a reference manual for developers. It covers a range of topics including algorithm analysis (Big O notation), linear data structures (linked lists, queues, stacks), non-linear data structures (hash maps, trees, graphs), and algorithm techniques such as sorting and dynamic programming. The project is structured as a library, offering reusable code examples in JavaScript, and is associated with a companion book. The target audience includes developers preparing for coding interviews or seeking to improve their problem-solving skills using JavaScript.
