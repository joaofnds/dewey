This repository provides a comprehensive JavaScript implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms, serving as both an educational resource and practical reference for software developers and computer science students. The codebase covers essential topics including algorithmic complexity analysis with Big O notation, linear data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues), non-linear structures (trees, graphs, heaps), and core algorithmic techniques like recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Designed primarily for coding interview preparation and computer science education, it offers production-ready JavaScript implementations that can be installed via NPM and imported into projects. The repository targets web developers, software engineers preparing for technical interviews, and students learning fundamental computer science concepts, providing both theoretical explanations and practical code examples for algorithm analysis, searching, sorting, and graph traversal operations.
