It provides comprehensive indexing capabilities for text, numeric, geospatial, and vector data types, supporting complex query operations including fuzzy matching, boolean queries, range searches, and k-nearest neighbor vector search. The library implements modern information retrieval algorithms like TF-IDF and BM25 scoring, features the Scorch storage engine for performance, and includes multi-language text analyzers for international applications.
