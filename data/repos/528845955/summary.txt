`notifier.nvim` is a non-intrusive notification management plugin for Neovim that consolidates and displays system messages in a floating window interface. Built in Lua, it captures and organizes notifications from two primary sources: LSP (Language Server Protocol) status updates and Neovim's native `vim.notify` system messages. The plugin provides configurable message filtering, automatic timeout clearing, log level controls, and replay functionality through Vim commands. It features customizable highlight groups, component ordering, and supports notification metadata like titles and icons. Targeted at software developers and power users who rely on Neovim as their primary code editor, it solves the problem of managing intrusive popup notifications and LSP server messages that can disrupt coding workflows by presenting them in a dedicated, organized sidebar interface.
