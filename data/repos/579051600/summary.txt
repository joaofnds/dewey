Git-Heat-Map is a standalone web application for visualizing the activity within a Git repository. It analyzes a repository's commit history using a Python script that leverages `git log` to generate a SQLite database storing file, commit, and author information. The application then employs JavaScript and a treemap visualization to display the data, highlighting file changes based on various filters such as author, date range, and file extension. The project features a front-end web server implemented with Flask, and targets developers and maintainers needing insights into code contribution patterns and file change frequency within their repositories.
