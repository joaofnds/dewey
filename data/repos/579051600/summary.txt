Git-Heat-Map is a repository visualization tool that analyzes Git commit history to generate interactive treemap visualizations showing file modification activity. Built with Python/Flask backend and JavaScript frontend, it parses Git logs using `git log`, stores commit metadata and file change statistics in SQLite database tables (Files, Commits, CommitFile, Author, CommitAuthor), then renders SVG treemaps where rectangle sizes represent total line changes per file. The tool supports filtering by author email, date ranges, file patterns, and commit hashes to highlight specific development activity patterns. Targeted at software developers, DevOps engineers, and project managers for codebase analysis, technical debt assessment, and understanding contributor impact across large repositories like Linux kernel or CPython.
