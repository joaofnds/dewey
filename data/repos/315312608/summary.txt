Digital-Logic-Sim is a C# desktop application that provides a visual, interactive environment for simulating digital logic circuits and Boolean operations. Built for educational technology and computer science pedagogy, it enables users to construct and test digital circuits using fundamental logic gates, flip-flops, and combinational logic components through a graphical interface. The simulator targets computer science students, educators, and hobbyists learning digital electronics fundamentals, allowing them to experiment with circuit design without physical hardware. Developed as part of an educational video series on computer architecture, it addresses the gap between theoretical digital logic concepts and hands-on experimentation, providing real-time circuit simulation and signal propagation visualization to reinforce understanding of how computers process binary information at the hardware level.
