The `vim/vim` repository hosts the source code for Vim, a cross-platform, text-based editor providing advanced features built upon the legacy of the Vi editor. Vim offers capabilities such as multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command-line history, spell checking, file completion, and a scripting language, including a GUI. Written primarily in C, the project provides a standalone application compatible with various operating systems, including Unix-like systems, Windows, and macOS, and is maintained by a community of developers and users.
