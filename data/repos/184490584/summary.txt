Terraformer is a CLI tool written in Go that performs reverse Terraform operations by generating Terraform configuration files (.tf/.json) and state files (.tfstate) from existing cloud infrastructure. It targets DevOps engineers and infrastructure teams who need to migrate legacy infrastructure to Infrastructure-as-Code practices using Terraform. The tool supports 30+ providers including major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), Kubernetes, monitoring systems (Datadog, New Relic), and VCS platforms (GitHub, GitLab). It leverages existing Terraform providers to discover and import resources, supports custom output patterns, remote state management with GCS buckets, and resource filtering/exclusion capabilities. This addresses the common DevOps challenge of retroactively applying Terraform management to manually-created infrastructure without requiring complete infrastructure recreation.
