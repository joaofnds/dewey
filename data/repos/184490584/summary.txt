**Terraformer** is a Go-based CLI tool that generates Terraform configuration files (`.tf`, `.json`, and `.tfstate`) from existing infrastructure, effectively reversing the Terraform process for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This tool supports multiple cloud providers such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure, Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, DigitalOcean, Equinix Metal, Fastly, Heroku, and many others. It also covers network, VCS, monitoring & system management, identity, and community services. Key features include generating `tf`/`json` + `tfstate` files for all supported objects by resource, remote state upload to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, connecting resources with `terraform_remote_state`, custom folder tree pattern saving of `tf`/`json` files, and importing resources by name and type. This tool is designed to easily support newly added resources using Terraform providers. Target users are DevOps engineers, SREs, and cloud architects who need to manage infrastructure across various cloud platforms.
