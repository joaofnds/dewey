Netcap is a Go-based network traffic analysis framework that converts live network packets or PCAP dump files into structured Protocol Buffer audit records for cybersecurity and network monitoring applications. Built for security researchers, network analysts, and intrusion detection specialists, it parses 58+ network protocols into type-safe data structures optimized for machine learning workflows and anomaly detection systems. The framework leverages concurrent processing, memory-safe parsing, and supports distributed collection through agent-server architecture. Primary use cases include honeypot monitoring, forensic analysis, and research on network intrusion detection systems. It targets cybersecurity professionals and researchers who need scalable, structured network data extraction from raw packet captures for security analytics and threat detection applications.
