Newman is a command-line collection runner for Postman that enables automated execution of API test collections outside the Postman GUI. Built in JavaScript/Node.js, it serves the API testing and DevOps domain by allowing developers and QA engineers to integrate Postman collections into CI/CD pipelines, build systems, and automated testing workflows. The tool addresses the need for headless API testing by executing HTTP requests, running test scripts, and generating reports (CLI, JSON, JUnit, HTML) programmatically. Newman can be used as both a standalone CLI tool and a Node.js library, supporting features like environment variables, data-driven testing, custom reporters, proxy configuration, and Docker containerization. Primary users include API developers, test automation engineers, and DevOps teams requiring scriptable API validation in continuous integration environments like Jenkins.
