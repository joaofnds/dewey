This JavaScript plugin integrates with semantic-release, the automated versioning and package publishing tool, to deliver real-time Slack notifications during CI/CD release workflows. Built for DevOps teams and release engineers, it monitors semantic-release execution states and sends structured messages to Slack channels via webhooks or bot tokens when releases succeed or fail. The plugin supports branch-specific notification configurations, allowing teams to customize alerts for different deployment environments (production, staging, LTS branches). It leverages the Slack Web API and incoming webhooks to provide immediate visibility into automated release processes, enabling development teams to track deployment status without manually monitoring CI pipelines. The tool addresses the critical need for real-time release communication in continuous deployment workflows where multiple stakeholders require instant notification of version releases and deployment failures.
