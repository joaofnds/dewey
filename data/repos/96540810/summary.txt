Keyv is a TypeScript-based abstraction layer for key-value storage systems designed for Node.js web development and backend applications. It provides a unified API interface across multiple storage backends including Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Memcache, and etcd, enabling developers to switch between different caching and persistence solutions without code changes. The monorepo architecture includes storage adapters, compression modules (brotli, gzip, lz4), and a standardized test suite for API compliance. This solution addresses the problem of vendor lock-in and inconsistent APIs across different storage systems, making it particularly valuable for full-stack developers, DevOps engineers, and backend architects who need flexible, scalable caching strategies for web applications, microservices, and distributed systems without being tied to specific database implementations.
