`KeepingYouAwake` is a standalone macOS utility application, implemented in Objective-C, designed to prevent a Mac computer from entering sleep mode. Functionality is provided by wrapping the built-in `caffeinate` command-line tool, allowing users to keep their machines awake for a specified duration or indefinitely via a menu bar interface. This developer-focused tool utilizes the macOS platform's native functionality, offering a user-friendly way to manage sleep behavior, particularly useful for desktop users and laptop users with an open lid.
