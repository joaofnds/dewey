KeepingYouAwake is a macOS menu bar utility written in Objective-C that prevents Mac computers from entering sleep mode for specified durations or indefinitely while activated. Built for macOS 10.13+ and targeting system administrators, developers, and power users, the application serves as a GUI wrapper around Apple's native `caffeinate` command-line tool. It addresses the common productivity problem of preventing system sleep during long-running tasks, presentations, or monitoring scenarios without requiring terminal access. The utility integrates directly into the macOS menu bar interface and leverages Apple's official sleep prevention APIs, making it suitable for enterprise environments and individual users who need reliable system wake management without third-party sleep control dependencies.
