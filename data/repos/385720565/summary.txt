editorconfig.nvim is an archived Neovim plugin written in Fennel that automatically applies EditorConfig file specifications to maintain consistent coding styles across projects. The plugin targets software developers using Neovim as their primary editor, particularly those working in collaborative development environments where consistent formatting standards are crucial. It supports core EditorConfig properties including charset, indentation style/size, line endings, trailing whitespace handling, and line length limits, while providing extensibility for custom properties through Lua configuration. The plugin leverages Neovim-specific APIs for performance optimization and was designed as a lightweight alternative to editorconfig-vim, offering the same functionality with significantly fewer lines of code before being superseded by native EditorConfig support in Neovim 0.9.
