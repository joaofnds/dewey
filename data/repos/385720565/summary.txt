`editorconfig.nvim` is an archived Neovim plugin designed to integrate EditorConfig functionality within the Neovim text editor. Written in Fennel, a Lisp that compiles to Lua, it provides EditorConfig property support, including `charset`, `end_of_line`, and `indent_size`. This plugin allows users to automatically enforce code style rules defined in `.editorconfig` files, enhancing code consistency across different projects.  It aims for simplicity and performance, offering a streamlined alternative to other EditorConfig plugins.
