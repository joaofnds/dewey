This Emacs Lisp package provides specialized major modes for editing Git configuration files within the Emacs text editor. It includes three distinct modes: `gitattributes-mode` for `.gitattributes` files, `gitconfig-mode` for `.gitconfig` and `.gitmodules` files (derived from `conf-unix-mode`), and `gitignore-mode` for `.gitignore` files and exclusion patterns. The package automatically activates appropriate syntax highlighting and editing features when opening Git-related configuration files, improving the developer experience for version control management. Targeting software developers and DevOps engineers who use Emacs as their primary editor, it solves the problem of enhanced editing support for Git's various configuration file formats, enabling better syntax recognition and file handling within the Emacs ecosystem.
