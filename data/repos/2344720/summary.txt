clj-http is an idiomatic Clojure HTTP client library that wraps the Apache HttpComponents client, designed for web development and API integration. It follows Ring protocol conventions, accepting Ring request maps and returning Ring response maps, making it naturally compatible with the Clojure web ecosystem. The library provides comprehensive HTTP functionality including all standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), async requests, authentication (Basic, Digest, NTLM, OAuth2), cookie management, SSL/TLS support, request/response middleware, connection pooling, and automatic JSON/form data coercion. It targets Clojure developers building web applications, microservices, and systems requiring HTTP client capabilities, offering both simple sugar functions for common operations and advanced configuration options for complex enterprise scenarios including proxy support, custom middleware, and Apache HttpClient customization.
