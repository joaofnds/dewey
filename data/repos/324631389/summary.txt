`jzon` is a Common Lisp library providing a correct and safe JSON (RFC 8259) reader and writer, emphasizing adherence to specifications and sane defaults. It offers core functionalities for deserialization (parsing) and serialization (stringifying) of JSON data, including streaming APIs for efficient processing. Key features include type mappings, safety mechanisms to prevent security vulnerabilities and stack exhaustion, and extensive customization options via generic functions like `jzon:coerced-fields` and `jzon:write-value`. This project is a library designed to be a robust tool for Common Lisp developers needing to work with JSON data.
