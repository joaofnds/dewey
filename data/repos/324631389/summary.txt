**jzon** is a Common Lisp JSON parser and serializer implementing RFC 8259 compliance for web development and data interchange scenarios. The library provides safe JSON deserialization/serialization with configurable safety limits (max-depth, max-string-length) to prevent resource exhaustion attacks, streaming parser/writer interfaces for large datasets, and extensible type mapping between JSON primitives and Common Lisp data structures (hash-tables, vectors, symbols). It features custom serialization through generic function specialization, supports non-standard JSON extensions (comments, trailing commas), and offers both high-level convenience functions (`parse`/`stringify`) and low-level streaming APIs for performance-critical applications. Targeted at Common Lisp developers building web services, APIs, configuration systems, or data processing pipelines requiring robust JSON handling with memory safety guarantees and RFC compliance.
