Quasar Framework is a Vue.js-based UI component library and build toolchain that enables cross-platform application development using a single JavaScript codebase. It targets frontend developers building responsive Single Page Applications (SPAs), Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), Server-Side Rendered (SSR) applications, Electron desktop apps, hybrid mobile apps for iOS/Android, and browser extensions. The framework implements Material Design principles and provides pre-built Vue components, while supporting both Webpack and Vite build systems. Quasar addresses the complexity of multi-platform deployment by abstracting platform-specific configurations and providing unified tooling through its CLI, allowing Vue.js developers to write once and deploy across web, mobile, and desktop environments without maintaining separate codebases for each target platform.
