DDDForum is a TypeScript-based forum application that serves as a comprehensive educational reference implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles for web developers. Built with Express.js backend, React/Redux frontend, Sequelize ORM, and Redis for session management, it demonstrates enterprise-grade software architecture patterns through a Hacker News-inspired discussion platform. The repository implements two bounded contexts (users and forum subdomains) with proper separation of domain, application, and infrastructure layers, showcasing SOLID principles and hexagonal architecture. Primarily targeting software architects and backend developers learning DDD methodology, it provides a production-ready codebase illustrating complex business logic organization, aggregate design patterns, and clean separation of concerns in TypeScript applications.
