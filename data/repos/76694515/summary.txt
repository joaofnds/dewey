Stimulus is a lightweight JavaScript framework written in TypeScript that provides DOM-based interaction patterns for web developers building server-rendered applications. It uses HTML data attributes (data-controller, data-target, data-action) to connect JavaScript controllers to existing markup without requiring virtual DOM or complex build processes. The framework automatically manages component lifecycle through DOM observation, making it ideal for progressive enhancement of traditional web applications, particularly those using server-side rendering with Rails, Django, or similar MVC frameworks. Stimulus integrates seamlessly with Turbo for SPA-like navigation while maintaining simplicity. It targets frontend developers who prefer HTML-first architectures over heavy JavaScript frameworks, solving the problem of adding interactive behavior to server-generated content without architectural complexity or extensive tooling requirements.
