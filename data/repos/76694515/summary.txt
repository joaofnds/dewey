Stimulus is a TypeScript JavaScript framework designed to augment HTML with behavior, primarily for front-end web development. It enables developers to write JavaScript controllers that respond to user interactions within the DOM using declarative attributes to connect HTML elements to controller actions. Key functionalities include automatic lifecycle management for controllers, seamless integration with Turbo (a companion framework), and support for any DOM update mechanism. This open-source library is intended for front-end developers and provides a lightweight solution for adding interactivity to web applications, allowing for focused JavaScript code separate from HTML rendering.
