Terrier is a command-line container security and supply chain verification tool built in Go that analyzes OCI-compliant Docker images and running containers to identify and verify specific files using SHA256 hash matching. Targeting DevOps engineers and security professionals, it addresses container supply chain security by enabling verification of binary components within containerized applications. The tool operates in two modes: scanning OCI tar archives of Docker images or analyzing live container filesystems via Docker's overlay2 merged directories. Users configure scans through YAML files specifying target file paths and expected hash values, making it valuable for compliance verification, malware detection, and ensuring trusted binary usage in production container deployments across CI/CD pipelines and runtime environments.
