swc-node is a high-performance TypeScript/JavaScript transpiler for Node.js applications that serves as a faster alternative to ts-node by eliminating type checking during transformation. Built on the SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) Rust-based transpiler, it provides Node.js register hooks, Jest transformer integration, and core transformation APIs for web development workflows. The toolkit targets frontend and full-stack JavaScript developers who need rapid TypeScript compilation during development, testing, and build processes. It supports both CommonJS and ESM module systems, integrates with existing TypeScript toolchains through .swcrc configuration, and delivers significant performance improvements over traditional TypeScript compiler and Babel transformations. The project addresses the bottleneck of slow TypeScript compilation in development environments while maintaining compatibility with Node.js execution patterns.
