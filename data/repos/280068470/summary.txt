`swc-node` is a TypeScript transformer designed to accelerate TypeScript/JavaScript execution, offering a faster alternative to `ts-node` without type checking. The project provides `@swc-node/core`, a high-performance transformer benchmarked against esbuild, TypeScript and Babel, and `@swc-node/jest`, a faster Jest transformer. Key functionality includes registering the transformer for Node.js execution, supporting ESM projects, and providing performance improvements for both compilation and testing within TypeScript projects. Implemented in TypeScript, the project offers core transformation capabilities and is distributed as a set of packages, `@swc-node/core`, `@swc-node/jest`, and `@swc-node/register`, for improved developer productivity in TypeScript environments.
