chromedp is a Go library that provides programmatic control of Chrome and Chromium browsers through the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) without external dependencies. Primarily targeting web developers, QA engineers, and automation specialists, it enables headless browser automation for web scraping, automated testing, UI testing, and screenshot generation. The library implements a native Go client for CDP, allowing developers to navigate pages, interact with DOM elements, execute JavaScript, and capture network traffic programmatically. It solves the complexity of browser automation by providing a simpler alternative to tools like Selenium, particularly suited for Go applications requiring reliable, fast browser control in both headless and headed modes for testing pipelines and web automation tasks.
