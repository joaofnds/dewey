OpenCV is a comprehensive open-source computer vision library written in C++ that provides optimized algorithms for image processing, video analysis, object detection, feature extraction, and machine learning tasks. It serves the computer vision and artificial intelligence domain, offering cross-platform support for desktop, mobile, and embedded systems development. The library implements core computer vision algorithms including geometric transformations, filtering, morphological operations, stereo vision, optical flow, and deep learning inference capabilities. OpenCV addresses the fundamental need for efficient, production-ready computer vision functionality across industries like robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, surveillance, and augmented reality. It targets computer vision engineers, researchers, software developers, and data scientists who require robust image and video processing capabilities without implementing complex mathematical algorithms from scratch.
