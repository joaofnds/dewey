Awesome-Selfhosted is a curated directory of free and open-source network services and web applications designed for self-hosting on private servers. The repository serves system administrators, privacy-conscious users, and DevOps professionals seeking alternatives to SaaS providers by cataloging hundreds of self-hostable solutions across domains including communication systems (email, XMPP, SIP), content management, file synchronization, analytics, backup solutions, and collaborative tools. The collection emphasizes GNU GPL and permissive licensed software that can be deployed on personal infrastructure, addressing privacy concerns and vendor lock-in issues inherent in cloud-based services. Each entry includes deployment information, licensing details, and technical specifications to help users evaluate and implement self-hosted alternatives to commercial platforms like Google Workspace, Slack, or Dropbox.
