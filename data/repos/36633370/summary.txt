`awesome-selfhosted` is a curated list, functioning as a comprehensive directory, of free and open-source network services and web applications designed for self-hosting. The repository organizes diverse software categories, including analytics, media streaming, and task management, enabling users to discover and deploy applications on their own servers, promoting privacy and control. The project's key functionality is to serve as an organized reference, listing self-hostable software with clear categorization. It is primarily a listing project written in Markdown, with a rendered HTML version available, and targets individuals, system administrators, and enthusiasts interested in self-hosting.
