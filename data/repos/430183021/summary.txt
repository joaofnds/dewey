pkgx is a 4MB standalone binary package manager and runtime environment written in Rust that enables running any version of development tools and programming languages without permanent system installation. Targeting DevOps engineers, software developers, and system administrators, it provides ephemeral package execution across macOS, Linux, and Windows platforms. The tool solves dependency management and version conflicts by allowing users to execute specific versions of tools (Node.js, Python, Deno, etc.) on-demand without affecting the host system. Key features include cross-platform compatibility, Docker integration, CI/CD pipeline support, and scripting capabilities with shebang syntax for dependency specification. It integrates with complementary tools like `dev` for project-specific virtual environments and `pkgm` for persistent installations, serving the broader software development and deployment ecosystem.
