Clack is a web server abstraction layer for Common Lisp that provides a standardized interface between web applications and HTTP servers, inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack specifications. It enables Common Lisp developers to write portable web applications that can run on multiple HTTP server backends including Hunchentoot, Wookie, Toot, and Woo without modification. The framework implements a simple request/response protocol where applications are functions that accept an environment hash and return HTTP status, headers, and body as a list. Clack includes both programmatic APIs and command-line tools via Roswell for deployment, solving the problem of server-specific coupling in Common Lisp web development. It targets Lisp developers building web applications who need deployment flexibility and server abstraction in the functional programming ecosystem.
