System Initiative is a Rust-based DevOps automation platform designed as a replacement for traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. Built as a monolithic repository using Buck2 for build orchestration, it provides a collaborative, visual approach to infrastructure management and deployment automation. The platform targets DevOps engineers, infrastructure teams, and system administrators who need to provision, configure, and manage cloud infrastructure and services. It leverages Docker for containerization, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and includes a web-based interface for infrastructure modeling and automation workflows. The system aims to solve the complexity and maintainability issues inherent in declarative IaC approaches by providing an intuitive, interactive platform for infrastructure lifecycle management across cloud environments.
