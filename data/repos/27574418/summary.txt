It functions as a font aggregator and patcher, combining numerous iconic glyph sets like Font Awesome, Material Design Icons, and Octicons into a unified set of fonts. The repository makes available over 3,600 icons across more than 50 patched fonts, including popular code fonts.  The project's primary language appears to be CSS, and utilities for patching and generating font assets are likely involved.
