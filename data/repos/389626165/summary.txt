`cmp-nvim-lsp` is a Neovim plugin providing a source for the `nvim-cmp` completion framework, specifically for the Neovim built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) client. It enhances completion functionality by supporting a wider range of LSP completion candidates beyond Neovim's default omnifunc, necessitating capability adjustments for compatibility. The plugin enables the integration of language server features within `nvim-cmp`, offering advanced code completion capabilities within the Neovim text editor, and includes options for customization of keyword patterns for specific language servers. Primarily a plugin, it targets Neovim users seeking improved code completion experiences leveraging LSP.
