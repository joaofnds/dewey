cmp-nvim-lsp is a Lua-based completion source plugin that integrates Neovim's built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) client with the nvim-cmp completion framework. It enables enhanced autocompletion capabilities for software developers using Neovim as their code editor by bridging LSP servers with the nvim-cmp completion engine. The plugin provides a `default_capabilities` helper function that advertises extended completion capabilities to LSP servers, allowing them to return richer completion candidates than Neovim's default omnifunc. It supports language-specific keyword pattern customization and works with various programming languages through LSP configurations like clangd, making it essential for developers seeking advanced IntelliSense-like features in their Neovim development environment across multiple programming languages and frameworks.
