Bolt is a pure Go embedded key-value database designed for applications requiring lightweight, serverless data persistence without the overhead of full database servers like PostgreSQL or MySQL. Inspired by LMDB, it provides ACID transactions, file-level locking, and B+ tree storage in a single disk file, targeting Go developers building desktop applications, microservices, and embedded systems. The database supports concurrent read-only transactions, single-writer semantics, and features like nested buckets, prefix scanning, and zero-copy reads. With its minimalist API focused solely on key-value operations, Bolt serves developers who need reliable local storage for configuration data, caching, or application state management without external database dependencies, particularly in DevOps tools, IoT applications, and standalone software where simplicity and reliability are prioritized over advanced querying capabilities.
