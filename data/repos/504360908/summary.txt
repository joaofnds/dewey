Gotraceui is a native desktop application for visualizing and analyzing Go execution traces, serving as a modern replacement for the built-in `go tool trace`. Built with Go and the Gio UI framework, it targets Go developers and performance engineers working on application profiling and performance optimization. The tool addresses limitations of the browser-based official tracer by providing a faster, standalone interface specifically designed for Go's tracing characteristics. It processes execution trace files generated by Go's runtime tracing system to help developers identify performance bottlenecks, goroutine behavior, and concurrency issues. The application is primarily used in software development and DevOps contexts where Go application performance analysis is critical.
