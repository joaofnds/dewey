`TheAlgorithms/Go` is a community-driven, open-source project providing implementations of various algorithms and data structures, primarily for educational purposes and interview preparation. Written in Go, the repository encompasses a broad range of functionalities, including sorting, searching, graph algorithms, string manipulation, and cryptographic ciphers. Key features include implementations of algorithms like Aho-Corasick, Kruskal's MST, and RSA encryption, alongside data structures such as heaps, linked lists, and tries.  It's structured as a library containing diverse algorithms and data structures, targeted towards developers and students learning Go and exploring fundamental computer science concepts.
