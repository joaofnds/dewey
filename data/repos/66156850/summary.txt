TheAlgorithms/Go is an educational repository implementing fundamental algorithms and data structures in Go programming language for computer science learning and technical interview preparation. The codebase covers core algorithmic domains including sorting algorithms, search algorithms, graph traversal, dynamic programming, string processing (Aho-Corasick pattern matching), mathematical computations (Armstrong numbers, binary operations), cryptographic functions, and classic data structures like trees, heaps, and linked lists. Built with comprehensive test coverage, continuous integration, and automated documentation generation, it serves as a reference implementation following Go best practices. The repository targets computer science students, software engineering candidates preparing for technical interviews, and developers seeking to understand algorithmic implementations in Go's idiomatic style, providing production-quality code examples for educational and professional development purposes.
