V is a compiled systems programming language designed for general-purpose software development with emphasis on simplicity, performance, and safety. The language targets system programmers and application developers who need C-like performance with modern language features including memory safety (no null pointers, immutability by default), fast compilation speeds (sub-second self-compilation), and zero runtime dependencies. V compiles to human-readable C code, supports automatic C-to-V translation for legacy code migration, and includes built-in tooling for web development (veb framework), database operations (ORM), and cross-platform GUI applications. The language addresses the complexity burden of modern systems programming by providing a minimalist syntax while maintaining compatibility with existing C codebases and supporting multiple compilation backends including native, JavaScript, and WebAssembly targets.
