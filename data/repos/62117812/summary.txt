Apache Pulsar is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging platform designed for high-throughput, low-latency event streaming and message queuing in enterprise distributed systems. Built primarily in Java, it serves the event-driven architecture and real-time data processing domains, providing horizontally scalable messaging with strong consistency guarantees, multi-tenancy, and geo-replication capabilities. The system addresses the need for reliable message delivery between microservices, stream processing applications, and IoT data pipelines, supporting both queue and topic semantics with transparent partitioning and batching. Target users include backend developers, platform engineers, and DevOps teams building distributed applications that require decoupled, asynchronous communication patterns with enterprise-grade features like authentication, authorization, and operational monitoring through REST APIs.
