This repository hosts the source code for "Clojure by Example," an educational documentation website that provides practical examples and tutorials for learning the Clojure programming language. Built using Middleman (a Ruby-based static site generator) and based on the Slate documentation framework, it targets software developers seeking to learn functional programming concepts through hands-on Clojure examples. The site covers core Clojure topics including data structures, sequences, collections, maps, and language fundamentals through executable code samples. The project uses Ruby/Bundler for dependency management, CircleCI for continuous integration, and generates a static website deployed via GitHub Pages, serving as a comprehensive reference for developers transitioning to functional programming or expanding their knowledge of JVM-based languages in the software development domain.
