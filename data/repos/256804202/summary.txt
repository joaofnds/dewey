`magit-delta` is an Emacs package providing a minor mode that integrates the `delta` utility (a Git diff viewer) within the Magit Git interface. It enables users to view diffs within Magit using `delta` for enhanced colorized output in the Emacs environment, especially when running in a terminal. This plugin, written in Emacs Lisp, is installed via MELPA and activated manually or automatically using Emacs configuration snippets. It functions as an extension, leveraging the functionality of both Magit and `delta` to improve the user experience when reviewing Git diffs.
