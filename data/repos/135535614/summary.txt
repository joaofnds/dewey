Corgi is a Go-based command-line workflow manager designed for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who frequently execute repetitive shell commands. It addresses the problem of command reusability by organizing frequently-used command sequences into templatable snippets with parameterized fields and default values. The tool integrates with existing shell environments (bash, zsh, fish) by accessing command history files, supports multi-step workflows, and provides fuzzy-finder integration (fzf, peco) for interactive snippet selection. Built with Go's CLI capabilities, Corgi enables users to create, execute, edit, and share command snippets while supporting template variables, step-by-step execution, and cross-platform compatibility. It targets infrastructure automation, deployment workflows, and repetitive system administration tasks where command standardization and reusability are essential.
