**all-the-icons-ivy** is an Emacs Lisp integration package that enhances the Ivy/Counsel completion framework by adding visual file-type and buffer icons from the all-the-icons.el library. Targeting Emacs power users and developers who use Ivy for fuzzy completion and navigation, this package automatically decorates file and buffer selection interfaces with contextual icons based on file extensions and types. The package provides customizable configuration for which Ivy commands receive icon decoration, including counsel-find-file, counsel-recentf, and counsel-projectile commands. It solves the visual identification problem in text-based completion menus by providing immediate visual context for different file types and buffers, improving workflow efficiency for developers working within the Emacs ecosystem who rely on Ivy's completion interface for project navigation and file management.
