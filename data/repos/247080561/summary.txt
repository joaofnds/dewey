`fdir` is a high-performance TypeScript library designed for fast directory crawling and globbing within NodeJS environments. It enables rapid traversal of the filesystem, capable of crawling one million files in under a second. Key features include a builder pattern for expressive API design and minimal dependencies, leveraging only NodeJS's `fs` and `path` modules for core functionality. This library is a developer productivity tool, specifically a library intended for use within Node.js projects needing efficient filesystem interaction, as demonstrated by its adoption in projects like Rollup plugins and Pulumi.
