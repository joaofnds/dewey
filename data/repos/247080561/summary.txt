**fdir** is a high-performance directory traversal and file globbing library for Node.js applications, targeting web developers and build tool maintainers who require fast filesystem operations. Built in TypeScript with zero dependencies (except optional picomatch for glob patterns), it provides a fluent Builder API for crawling directory trees and filtering files based on patterns, paths, and custom criteria. The library solves performance bottlenecks in build systems, bundlers, and development tools by delivering sub-second directory scanning of large codebases (1M+ files), making it ideal for JavaScript/TypeScript projects requiring efficient file discovery, static site generators, and CI/CD pipelines where filesystem traversal speed directly impacts developer productivity and build times.
