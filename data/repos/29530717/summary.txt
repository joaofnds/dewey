`hydra` is an Emacs Lisp package providing a framework for creating interactive "Hydra" menus, which are transient key-binding families with a common prefix. The core functionality enables users to chain related Emacs commands using short bindings that persist after the initial prefix keypress, displaying a dynamic hint to guide available options. The package utilizes Emacs Lisp and relies on defining `defhydra` structures to create custom interactive modes. This is a developer productivity tool, specifically an Emacs extension or library, designed for Emacs users to improve command discoverability and streamline workflows.
