XState is a TypeScript-based state management library implementing finite state machines, statecharts, and the actor model for JavaScript/TypeScript applications. Targeting web developers building complex frontend and backend logic, it provides zero-dependency state orchestration using event-driven programming patterns inspired by the SCXML specification. The library enables developers to model application workflows, user interfaces, and business logic as visual state machines with predictable state transitions, context management, and side effect handling. XState integrates with popular frameworks including React, Vue, and Svelte, offering visual tooling through Stately Studio for creating and debugging state machines. It addresses the problem of managing complex application state flows, async operations, and multi-step processes in modern web applications where traditional state management approaches become unwieldy.
