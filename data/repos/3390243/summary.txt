Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in Rust that provides a lightweight, high-performance alternative for embedding web technologies in applications. Targeting web developers and browser engine developers, it implements web platform standards including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rendering capabilities across multiple platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, OpenHarmony). The project leverages Rust's memory safety and concurrency features to create a parallel browser engine architecture, addressing performance and security limitations of traditional browser engines. Servo serves as both a research platform for modern web engine design and a practical embedding solution for applications requiring web content rendering, offering developers an alternative to WebKit, Blink, or Gecko engines.
