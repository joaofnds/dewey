Servo is a high-performance, parallel web browser engine designed as a lightweight alternative for embedding web technologies. Written in Rust, it aims to provide a platform for developing web-based applications, including a `servoshell` executable, across multiple operating systems: macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, and OpenHarmony. The project leverages Rust's memory safety and concurrency features to build a browser engine offering capabilities like rendering web content, indicated by its focus on web platform standards. This standalone application (web engine) is targeted towards developers looking to embed web functionalities within their applications.
