Rainbow-delimiters is an Emacs Lisp package that provides syntax highlighting for nested delimiters (parentheses, brackets, braces) by colorizing them according to their nesting depth. Designed for software development environments, it targets programmers working with delimiter-heavy languages like Lisp, Clojure, and other functional programming languages, though it supports any programming language. The package integrates with Emacs text editor through major mode hooks and offers customizable color schemes via Emacs faces. It addresses the common problem of delimiter matching and code structure visualization in deeply nested code, helping developers quickly identify matching pairs and understand code hierarchy. The implementation emphasizes performance optimization to maintain editing speed in complex codebases while providing visual assistance for code navigation and debugging.
