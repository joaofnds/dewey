`Noticent` is a Ruby gem designed for managing user notifications within web applications, streamlining the creation, subscription, and delivery of various notification types. It provides a developer-friendly interface for defining alerts, scopes, channels (like email, Slack, and webhooks), and recipients, facilitating flexible notification configurations. The gem's architecture centers around a configuration-driven approach, allowing users to define notification workflows through Ruby code, and leverages concepts like payloads and opt-in providers for managing notification delivery and user subscriptions. This library primarily targets Ruby on Rails developers building web applications that require sophisticated notification systems.
