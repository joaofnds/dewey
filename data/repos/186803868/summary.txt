Noticent is a Ruby gem for Rails applications that provides a structured notification management system for web developers. It abstracts notification delivery across multiple channels (email, Slack, webhooks, mobile push) through a declarative configuration approach using concepts like Alerts, Scopes, Channels, Recipients, and Payloads. The gem integrates with Rails' ActiveRecord for persistence and follows Rails conventions for templating and organization. It addresses the common web application problem of managing complex notification workflows by providing a maintainable architecture for subscription management, multi-channel delivery, and notification state tracking. Designed for Ruby/Rails developers building web applications that require sophisticated user notification systems with support for multiple delivery channels and recipient management.
