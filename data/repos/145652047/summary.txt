`cargo-crev` is a cryptographically verifiable code review system specifically designed for Rust's cargo package manager, targeting software security and supply chain integrity in the Rust ecosystem. Built in Rust, it implements a decentralized, peer-to-peer trust network that allows developers to publish and consume cryptographically signed reviews of crate dependencies. The tool addresses the critical problem of dependency trustworthiness in modern software development by enabling developers to identify untrustworthy crates, security vulnerabilities, and dependency bloat through community-driven code reviews. It integrates directly with cargo workflows, providing metrics, warnings, and trust assessments based on a web-of-trust model, primarily serving Rust developers, security engineers, and teams focused on secure software supply chain management who need to evaluate the safety and quality of third-party dependencies.
