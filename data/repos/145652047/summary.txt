`cargo-crev` is a Rust-based, cryptographically verifiable code review system designed for the cargo package manager. It facilitates a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) approach to code review, enabling scalable and secure trust verification within the Rust ecosystem. The system's core functionality revolves around enabling cryptographically secured reviews and trust management, which directly enhances the security posture of software dependencies. This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool, leveraging the Rust programming language and its ecosystem to provide developers with a means of evaluating the trustworthiness of Rust packages.
