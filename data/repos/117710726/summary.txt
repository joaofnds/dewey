Twirp is a Go-based RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework designed for simplifying service-to-service communication with a focus on minimalism and ease of use. Utilizing Protobuf service definitions, it automatically generates routing and serialization logic, allowing developers to focus on application-specific logic. The framework leverages the standard library's `net/http` server, supporting both HTTP/1.1 and JSON serialization for debugging, and provides autogenerated clients alongside a streamlined error handling mechanism. This library is a Go-specific framework, offering a simpler alternative to gRPC, with third-party implementations available in numerous other languages for cross-language RPC needs.
