Twirp is a lightweight RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework for service-to-service communication in distributed systems, developed by Twitch for backend web development. Built in Go, it generates routing and serialization code from Protocol Buffers service definitions, eliminating boilerplate for HTTP methods, paths, and JSON handling. Unlike gRPC, Twirp runs on Go's standard `net/http` server, supporting both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 with JSON serialization for debugging alongside protobuf binary format. The framework automatically generates type-safe clients and servers, handles error propagation, and focuses on microservice architectures where simplicity and performance are prioritized over gRPC's advanced features. Target users are Go backend developers building distributed systems, APIs, and microservice architectures who need efficient inter-service communication without the complexity of custom HTTP implementations.
