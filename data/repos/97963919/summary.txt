**org-web-tools** is an Emacs Lisp package that enables web content integration into Org-mode workflows for knowledge management and documentation. It provides commands to download web pages, extract readable content using `eww-readable`, convert HTML to Org-mode format via Pandoc, and insert the processed content as structured Org entries or buffers. The tool handles URL extraction from clipboard/kill-ring, creates timestamped entries with proper heading hierarchies, and supports web page archiving with `org-attach`. Key functions include `org-web-tools-read-url-as-org` for content viewing, `org-web-tools-insert-web-page-as-entry` for structured insertion, and batch link conversion capabilities. Designed for Emacs users, researchers, and knowledge workers who use Org-mode for note-taking and want to seamlessly capture and organize web content within their existing text-based workflows.
