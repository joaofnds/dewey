Ghidra is a comprehensive software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by the NSA for cybersecurity and malware analysis. Built primarily in Java, it provides disassembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting capabilities for analyzing compiled code across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. The framework supports multiple processor instruction sets and executable formats, enabling security researchers and analysts to examine malicious code, identify vulnerabilities, and understand binary behavior. Ghidra addresses scaling and collaboration challenges in reverse engineering through its extensible architecture that supports custom plugins and scripts in Java or Python. Target users include cybersecurity professionals, malware analysts, vulnerability researchers, and software security engineers who need to analyze compiled binaries without access to source code.
