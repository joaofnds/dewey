Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework designed for analyzing compiled code across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This Java-based application provides capabilities such as disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, supporting various processor instruction sets and executable formats. Users can extend Ghidra with custom scripts and extensions developed using Java or Python, and the project functions as a standalone, full-featured software analysis tool. The project is open-source and developed by the NSA.
