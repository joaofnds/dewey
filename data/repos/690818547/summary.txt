Nue is a standards-first web framework built in JavaScript that aims to simplify modern web development by reducing complexity and bundle sizes. Targeting web developers frustrated with bloated JavaScript frameworks, it focuses on leveraging native web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and WebAssembly) rather than adding abstraction layers. The framework addresses the problem of excessive complexity in contemporary web development where simple components often require disproportionately large JavaScript bundles. Nue is rebuilding the web development ecosystem from scratch, offering an alternative to heavyweight frameworks like React or Vue by emphasizing web standards compliance and minimal overhead. The project targets frontend developers seeking lighter, more performant alternatives to existing JavaScript frameworks while maintaining modern development capabilities.
