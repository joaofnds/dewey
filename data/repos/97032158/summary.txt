Fulcro is a full-stack web application framework for building data-driven single-page applications using Clojure and ClojureScript. It provides a comprehensive development platform that integrates React for UI rendering with a unified data management system spanning client and server components. The framework targets web developers building complex interactive applications that require consistent state management across the full stack, eliminating the traditional separation between frontend and backend data handling. Fulcro addresses the architectural complexity of modern web applications by offering a cohesive programming model where developers can use Clojure/ClojureScript throughout the entire application stack, from database queries to UI components, while leveraging React's component system for efficient DOM updates and user interface rendering.
