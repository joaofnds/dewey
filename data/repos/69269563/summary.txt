RobotGo is a cross-platform desktop automation library written in Go that provides native GUI automation and RPA (Robotic Process Automation) capabilities for Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. It leverages C bindings and system APIs to control mouse movements, keyboard input, screen capture, window management, and global event handling, while supporting image processing through OpenCV integration. The library targets automation developers, QA engineers, and system administrators who need to build desktop automation scripts, testing frameworks, or RPA solutions. Built on CGO with platform-specific dependencies like X11/XTest for Linux, it enables programmatic control of desktop applications and system interactions, making it suitable for automated testing, data entry automation, and desktop workflow orchestration tasks requiring precise GUI manipulation.
