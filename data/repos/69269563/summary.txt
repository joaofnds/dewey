`go-vgo/robotgo` is a cross-platform Go library providing Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and GUI automation capabilities. Its core functionality centers around interacting with the operating system to control the mouse, keyboard, read the screen, and manage windows, including image and bitmap manipulation and event handling. The library is built in Go and leverages C bindings for interacting with OS-specific APIs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (X11), utilizing dependencies like OpenCV for image processing and GoHook for event listening. As a library, it targets developers looking to automate desktop tasks and build automation tools.
