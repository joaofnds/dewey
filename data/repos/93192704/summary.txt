This repository contains a comprehensive Linux desktop configuration package (dotfiles) designed for power users and system administrators who prefer minimalist, keyboard-driven workflows. The configuration targets the suckless software ecosystem, integrating window manager (dwm), terminal emulator (st), and status bar (dwmblocks) with shell scripting, Vim/Neovim text editing, zsh shell customization, and terminal-based applications for file management (lf), music playback (mpd/ncmpcpp), and media viewing (mpv, nsxiv). Deployed through the LARBS (Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstrapping Scripts) automation system, it addresses the problem of manual Linux desktop environment setup by providing a curated, XDG-compliant configuration that emphasizes terminal-based productivity tools over graphical applications. The target users are Linux enthusiasts, system administrators, and developers seeking an efficient, scriptable desktop environment with minimal resource overhead and maximum customization control.
