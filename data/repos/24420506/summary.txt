V8 is Google's open-source JavaScript engine that implements the ECMAScript specification (ECMA-262) and serves as the runtime foundation for executing JavaScript code in web browsers and server-side applications. Written primarily in C++, it features a sophisticated compiler pipeline, bytecode interpreter, and virtual machine architecture that transforms JavaScript source code into optimized machine code. V8 powers Google Chrome's JavaScript execution and can be embedded into C++ applications, making it essential for web development, Node.js server-side programming, and hybrid application frameworks. The engine targets web developers, browser vendors, and systems programmers who need high-performance JavaScript execution capabilities, addressing the critical need for fast, standards-compliant JavaScript interpretation and compilation in modern web applications and runtime environments.
