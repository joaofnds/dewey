This repository provides community-maintained Helm charts for ArgoProj ecosystem tools, serving the DevOps and Kubernetes infrastructure domain. It packages GitOps and workflow automation tools including Argo CD (continuous deployment), Argo Workflows (container-native workflow engine), Argo Events (event-driven workflow automation), and Argo Rollouts (progressive delivery) as deployable Helm charts. The charts utilize Mustache templating and Helm's capabilities API to handle Kubernetes version compatibility and custom resource definitions (CRDs). Target users are platform engineers, DevOps engineers, and Kubernetes administrators who need to deploy and manage GitOps toolchains and CI/CD pipelines in Kubernetes clusters. The repository addresses the challenge of standardized, repeatable deployment of complex ArgoProj applications with configurable parameters and proper CRD management across different Kubernetes environments.
