The `argoproj/argo-helm` repository provides community-maintained Helm charts for Argo Project applications. These charts facilitate the deployment and management of Argo CD, Argo Workflows, Argo Events, and Argo Rollouts within Kubernetes clusters. The project leverages the Helm templating engine, utilizes Helm's "Capabilities" object for Kubernetes cluster support, and includes features for custom resource definition (CRD) management, allowing users to deploy Argo components using standard Helm workflows. The charts are written in Mustache and target Kubernetes operators and system administrators deploying and managing Argo-based continuous delivery and workflow automation solutions.
