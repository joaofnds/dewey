clj-kondo is a static analyzer and linter for Clojure, ClojureScript, and EDN code that performs compile-time error detection and code quality analysis without executing programs. Built in Clojure and compiled to native binaries using GraalVM, it detects arity errors, unused variables, unresolved symbols, redundant expressions, namespace issues, type checking violations, and enforces style guide recommendations from the Clojure community. Targeting Clojure developers and development teams, it integrates with editors and build tools to provide real-time feedback on code quality, supports common macro syntax, analyzes configuration files like deps.edn, and offers extensibility through analysis data for custom linting rules, serving as a foundational development tool in the Clojure ecosystem.
