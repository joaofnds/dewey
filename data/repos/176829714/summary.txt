`clj-kondo` is a static analyzer and linter for Clojure, ClojureScript, and EDN files, designed to identify potential errors and enforce style guidelines during development. It provides features such as arity error detection across namespaces, unused variable detection, unresolved symbol identification, and style rule enforcement based on established Clojure coding standards. Built with Clojure and utilizing GraalVM for native compilation, `clj-kondo` is a standalone command-line tool and provides analysis data for custom linter creation. The target audience includes Clojure and ClojureScript developers seeking to improve code quality and maintainability through automated static analysis within their build and editor workflows.
