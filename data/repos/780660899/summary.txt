vlt is a TypeScript-based package manager for the Node.js ecosystem, designed as an alternative to npm, yarn, and pnpm for JavaScript/TypeScript developers. This monorepo implements a complete package management solution that handles dependency installation, workspace management, and package distribution workflows. Built primarily in TypeScript with Node.js, vlt targets web developers and JavaScript engineers working on both single packages and monorepo architectures. The CLI tool addresses common pain points in JavaScript dependency management by providing enhanced performance, better workspace support, and streamlined development workflows. As a comprehensive package manager, it competes directly with established tools like npm and yarn while offering modern features for contemporary JavaScript development practices including monorepo management and optimized dependency resolution algorithms.
