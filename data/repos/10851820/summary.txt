Ramda is a JavaScript library providing a practical functional programming toolkit. It emphasizes immutability and side-effect-free functions to facilitate the creation of functional pipelines, with automatic currying of functions and data-last parameter arrangement to streamline function composition.  Designed specifically for JavaScript, the library provides common functional programming utilities such as `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`, with a focus on API clarity and performance.  This project is a JavaScript library intended for use by JavaScript developers seeking to adopt or enhance functional programming paradigms in their projects.
