Ramda is a functional programming utility library for JavaScript that provides immutable, side-effect-free functions with automatic currying and data-last parameter ordering. Designed for web developers working in JavaScript/Node.js environments, it enables functional programming patterns through function composition and pipeline creation without mutating user data. The library offers alternatives to imperative JavaScript coding styles by providing pure functions that can be easily combined and reused. Unlike general-purpose utility libraries, Ramda specifically targets developers who want to implement functional programming paradigms in JavaScript applications, supporting both browser and server-side environments including Deno. It serves as a foundation for building complex data transformations through simple, composable function chains while maintaining JavaScript's native data structures and language features.
