`lazy-require.nvim` is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that implements lazy loading mechanisms for module imports to optimize editor startup performance. Targeting Neovim users and plugin developers in the text editor/IDE domain, it provides three core metatable-based functions: `require_on_index()` for deferring module loading until first table access, `require_on_module_call()` for loading when the module itself is invoked, and `require_on_exported_call()` for loading when specific exported functions are called. The plugin addresses the common performance bottleneck of eager module loading in Neovim configurations and plugins, where numerous Lua modules are imported at startup but may not be immediately used, causing unnecessary initialization overhead and slower editor launch times.
