`lazy-require.nvim` is a Lua library designed to optimize module loading within the Neovim text editor, focusing on delayed or "lazy" module initialization to improve startup performance and reduce memory footprint. It provides helper functions, including `require_on_index`, `require_on_module_call`, and `require_on_exported_call`, that defer module loading until a specific trigger, such as indexing a table, calling the module itself, or calling an exported function. This plugin acts as a utility, offering developers a means to configure lazy loading behavior in their Neovim configurations and plugins.
