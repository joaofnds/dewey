General.el is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a unified, declarative API for defining keybindings across different Emacs contexts and Evil mode states. Targeting Emacs power users and configuration enthusiasts, it abstracts the complexity of Emacs' multiple keybinding systems (global maps, local maps, Evil states, prefix keys) into a single `general-define-key` interface. The package integrates with Evil mode for Vim emulation, supports deferred loading with autoloading mechanisms, and includes utilities for key recording, simulation, and conditional dispatching. It solves the fragmented nature of Emacs keybinding configuration by offering consistent syntax across different scopes (normal, insert, visual states) while maintaining compatibility with existing Emacs and Evil keybinding paradigms, primarily serving experienced Emacs developers seeking streamlined configuration management.
