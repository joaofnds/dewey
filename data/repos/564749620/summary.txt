TreeSJ is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that leverages Tree-Sitter parsing to intelligently split and join code blocks across multiple programming languages. Targeting software developers working in polyglot environments, it automates code formatting transformations for data structures like arrays, objects, dictionaries, and function parameters, converting between single-line and multi-line representations. The plugin supports over 25 languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, and others, using Tree-Sitter's abstract syntax tree analysis to understand code structure contextually. It integrates with nvim-treesitter and provides configurable presets for language-specific formatting rules, cursor behavior management, and recursive nested node processing, solving the common developer workflow problem of manually reformatting code blocks during refactoring sessions.
