Kong is a cloud-native API Gateway and reverse proxy built on Lua/LuaJIT and Nginx, designed for managing microservices and API traffic in enterprise DevOps environments. It provides centralized API management capabilities including request/response routing, load balancing, authentication, rate limiting, SSL termination, and health checking through a plugin-based architecture. The platform targets DevOps engineers, platform architects, and backend developers managing distributed systems, offering both database-backed and DB-less deployment modes with native Kubernetes integration via ingress controllers. Kong addresses API orchestration complexity in microservices architectures while providing AI gateway functionality for multi-LLM implementations, supporting deployment across Docker, Kubernetes, and hybrid cloud-native infrastructure with extensibility through custom Lua plugins.
