`shopspring/decimal` is a Go library providing arbitrary-precision fixed-point decimal numbers, designed for financial calculations and other applications requiring precise numerical representation. It offers functionalities including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with specified precision, alongside database serialization/deserialization support. The library's architecture centers around a custom decimal type, providing safe zero-value handling and a user-friendly API to prevent common precision errors inherent in floating-point types. This library is primarily a utility library for Go developers focused on applications where accurate decimal arithmetic is critical, such as e-commerce or financial software.
