The shopspring/decimal repository provides an arbitrary-precision fixed-point decimal number library for Go, specifically designed to solve floating-point precision issues in financial and monetary calculations. Unlike Go's native float64 type which cannot accurately represent decimal numbers like 0.1, this library ensures exact decimal arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) without precision loss. It targets Go developers building e-commerce, billing, accounting, and financial applications where monetary accuracy is critical. The library offers immutable decimal types with built-in JSON/XML/database serialization support, providing a safer alternative to big.Rat for money calculations by maintaining exact decimal representations rather than rational fractions that can introduce rounding discrepancies in financial contexts.
