Vue Smooth Reflow is a JavaScript mixin library for Vue.js applications that provides smooth CSS transitions for element reflow operations in web development. It specifically addresses the challenge of transitioning dynamic layout changes, particularly `height: auto` and `width: auto` properties, which are typically not animatable with standard CSS transitions. The library registers CSS properties (height, width, transform) on DOM elements and automatically calculates transitions when component data changes trigger layout reflows. It operates independently of Vue's built-in `<transition>` components and includes features like CSS selector targeting, custom transition timing, and transitionend event handling. The mixin is designed for frontend developers building dynamic Vue.js interfaces requiring smooth animations during content expansion, repositioning, or responsive layout changes.
