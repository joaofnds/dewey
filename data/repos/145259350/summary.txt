`vue-smooth-reflow` is a JavaScript library designed as a Vue.js mixin to smoothly transition the reflow of HTML elements when their data changes. It facilitates animations for properties like `height`, `width`, and `transform`, enabling features such as transitioning `height: auto` and repositioning elements. The core functionality leverages CSS transitions, with options for customized transition durations and properties, including handling transitions triggered by external events using `transitionEvent`. This library is a frontend development tool, a Vue.js mixin, used to improve the visual experience of Vue.js applications by providing smooth transitions and handling reflows.
