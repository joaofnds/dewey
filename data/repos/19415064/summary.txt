The OSSU Computer Science repository is a comprehensive curriculum aggregator that provides a structured pathway for self-taught computer science education. It serves the academic/educational domain by curating and organizing existing online courses from institutions like MIT, Harvard, and Princeton into a cohesive undergraduate-equivalent computer science program. The curriculum covers core CS fundamentals including programming, algorithms, data structures, systems programming, computer architecture, databases, and software engineering, supplemented with mathematics and theoretical foundations. Built as an HTML-based resource with structured markdown documentation, it addresses the problem of fragmented online CS education by providing a validated, peer-reviewed learning sequence that follows CS 2013 curricular guidelines. The target users are self-directed learners, career changers, and autodidacts seeking systematic computer science knowledge without formal university enrollment, requiring approximately 2 years of dedicated study.
