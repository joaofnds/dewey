**nivo** is a TypeScript-based React component library for building interactive data visualization applications, targeting web developers and data analysts who need declarative charting solutions. Built on top of D3.js, it provides a comprehensive suite of customizable chart components that render to SVG, HTML, or Canvas with support for server-side rendering and HTTP APIs. The library addresses the gap in React-D3 integration by offering fully declarative, responsive charts with built-in theming, animations via react-spring, and isomorphic rendering capabilities. Developers can install modular packages like `@nivo/core` and specific chart types to create production-ready data visualization dashboards and applications without direct D3 manipulation, while maintaining the power and flexibility of D3's visualization primitives through a React-friendly API.
