`frog-jump-buffer` is an Emacs Lisp package that provides fast buffer navigation for Emacs text editor users through keyboard-driven selection. Built on top of the `avy` and `frog-menu` libraries, it enables developers and power users to switch between open buffers using 2-3 keystrokes via character-based jumping interface. The package targets software developers, writers, and other professionals who use Emacs for coding, text editing, or project management. It offers configurable buffer filtering options including same-mode buffers, file-backed buffers, project-specific buffers (via Projectile integration), and recently accessed files through `recentf`. The tool addresses the common workflow inefficiency of navigating between multiple open files in complex development environments, replacing slower mouse-based or menu-driven buffer switching with rapid keyboard shortcuts and visual selection overlays.
