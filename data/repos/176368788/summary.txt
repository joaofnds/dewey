`frog-jump-buffer` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to provide rapid buffer navigation, enabling users to switch between open buffers with minimal keystrokes. Leveraging `avy` and `frog-menu`, it offers a speed-optimized alternative to `ace-jump-buffer`. Key functionalities include buffer filtering based on mode, file association, recent history, project context (via `projectile`), and similarly named buffers, customizable through regular expressions and user-defined filter actions.  It also features integration with `all-the-icons-ivy` for enhanced visual identification of buffers. This is a developer productivity plugin/extension specifically for Emacs users.
