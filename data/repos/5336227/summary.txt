Busted is a comprehensive unit testing framework specifically designed for the Lua programming ecosystem, supporting Lua 5.1+, LuaJIT 2.0+, and MoonScript. It provides a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing interface with natural language constructs like `describe` and `it` blocks, chainable assertion methods, and extensible matchers for deep object comparisons. The framework includes advanced testing utilities such as spies, mocks, and test tagging for selective execution, along with multiple output formats including JSON, TAP, and terminal-based reporters for CI/CD integration. Targeting Lua developers and software engineers working on Lua-based applications, libraries, and embedded systems, Busted addresses the need for robust automated testing in the Lua development workflow where testing frameworks are traditionally limited compared to other programming languages.
