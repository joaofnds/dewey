Maccy is a native macOS clipboard manager application built in Swift that provides persistent clipboard history functionality for Mac users. The application targets productivity-focused macOS users who need to manage and reuse copied content efficiently. It implements a lightweight menu bar utility that monitors the system pasteboard, stores clipboard history, and provides keyboard-driven navigation with shortcuts for selecting, pasting, and managing clipboard items. Key features include search functionality, item pinning, formatted/unformatted paste options, and configurable ignore patterns for sensitive data types. The application integrates deeply with macOS system APIs for pasteboard monitoring and uses native Cocoa UI components, requiring macOS Sonoma 14+ and focusing on privacy-conscious clipboard management for power users, developers, and content creators.
