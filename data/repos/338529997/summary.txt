Grida is an open-source canvas-based platform that provides integrated database management, form building, and visual design tools specifically designed for Supabase-powered applications. Built with TypeScript, it combines PostgreSQL database administration capabilities with a drag-and-drop form builder supporting 30+ input types, real-time synchronization, and a technical preview canvas editor with SVG/bitmap editing and Figma import functionality. The platform targets web developers, database administrators, and no-code users who need to manage Supabase databases, create custom forms with complex logic, and design interfaces without switching between multiple tools. It leverages Supabase for backend services, Shadcn UI for components, TailwindCSS for styling, and includes WebGPU support for advanced canvas rendering, solving the fragmentation of database management, form creation, and design workflows in modern web development.
