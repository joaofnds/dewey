`CLOG` is a Common Lisp web framework enabling the creation of cross-platform graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and interactive web applications that run locally or remotely. It utilizes web technologies, specifically WebSockets, for communication between the server-side Lisp application and a browser-based frontend. Key functionalities include building GUIs with HTML bindings, a built-in GUI builder, and support for desktop, mobile, and embedded systems applications. The project is a framework with extensions for web page creation, database interaction, and authentication, targeting Common Lisp developers building both desktop and web-based interactive applications.
