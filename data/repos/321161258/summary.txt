CLOG (Common Lisp Omnificent GUI) is a cross-platform GUI framework that enables Common Lisp developers to build graphical applications using web technologies as the rendering layer. It establishes WebSocket connections between a Lisp server and browser clients, allowing developers to write GUI logic entirely in Common Lisp while leveraging HTML/CSS/JavaScript for presentation. The framework targets desktop application development, web application development, and cross-platform GUI creation, supporting deployment on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. CLOG includes an integrated IDE called CLOG Builder for visual GUI design and development. It solves the problem of limited native GUI options for Common Lisp by providing a web-based alternative that maintains real-time bidirectional communication between the Lisp backend and browser frontend, enabling developers to create modern interfaces without leaving the Lisp ecosystem.
