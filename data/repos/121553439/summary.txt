Orca is an esoteric, live-coding environment implemented in JavaScript, designed for creating procedural sequencers and audio/visual interfaces. The application functions as a live-coding tool, enabling users to generate MIDI, OSC, and UDP messages to control external audio and visual interfaces such as Ableton, Renoise, and VCV Rack. The project's core functionality revolves around an operator-based, grid-like programming paradigm, where each letter of the alphabet represents a specific operation, operating frame-by-frame or in response to "bang" signals. This standalone application leverages JavaScript and Electron for its desktop implementation, with additional versions written in C, Lua, and assembly for terminal, embedded, and Monome Norns environments respectively.
