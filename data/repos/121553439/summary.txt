Orca is an esoteric programming language implemented in JavaScript/Electron designed for live coding and procedural music sequencing. It operates on a 2D grid where each alphabetic character represents a specific operation, with lowercase letters executing on bang events and uppercase letters executing per frame. The language functions as a MIDI/OSC/UDP controller rather than a synthesizer, interfacing with external audio software like Ableton, Renoise, VCV Rack, and SuperCollider. It provides operators for mathematical calculations, timing control, pattern generation, and I/O operations including MIDI note transmission, control changes, and network messaging. The tool targets electronic musicians, live coding performers, and creative technologists who need real-time programmatic control over digital audio workstations and modular synthesis environments through a minimalist grid-based programming interface.
