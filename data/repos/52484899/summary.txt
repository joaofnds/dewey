This repository provided an SVGinOT (SVG in OpenType) color emoji font built from EmojiOne artwork, targeting Linux desktop users and web developers working with emoji rendering. The project used Makefile-based build processes to generate font files with full Unicode emoji support including ZWJ sequences, skin tone modifiers, and country flags. It addressed the problem of inconsistent emoji display across operating systems by providing a standardized color font that worked in Firefox, Thunderbird, and select applications, while maintaining B&W fallback compatibility. The font was primarily designed for Linux system administrators and desktop users who needed consistent emoji rendering, distributed through Ubuntu PPAs and manual installation scripts. The project has reached end-of-life due to upstream EmojiOne licensing changes and users are directed to migrate to the Twitter-based twemoji-color-font alternative.
