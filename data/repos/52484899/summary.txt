This repository, now marked End-of-Life, provided a color emoji font in the SVGinOT format, enabling color emoji rendering across various operating systems. Built from EmojiOne artwork, it supported features like ZWJ sequences, skin tone diversity, and country flags. The project utilizes the `Makefile` build system and depends on tools like Inkscape, Imagemagick, FontForge, and SCFBuild to generate and compile the font files. It was designed as a font library or utility for developers and users seeking to integrate and render color emoji within applications and operating systems, particularly targeting Linux, macOS, and Windows environments.
