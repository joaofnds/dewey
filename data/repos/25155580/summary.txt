The fastruby/fast-ruby repository is a comprehensive performance optimization resource that benchmarks and documents Ruby idioms to identify faster coding patterns. Built for Ruby developers focused on performance optimization, it uses benchmark-ips for precise performance measurements across various Ruby constructs including arrays, hashes, strings, enumerables, and general language features. The repository systematically compares alternative implementations of common Ruby operations (like `attr_accessor` vs manual getters/setters, `begin...rescue` vs `respond_to?`, string manipulation methods) providing quantified performance data with iterations per second metrics. Each idiom includes executable code examples and real-world performance benchmarks run against multiple Ruby implementations via GitHub Actions CI. This serves as both a reference guide and educational tool for Ruby developers seeking to write more performant code in web applications, APIs, and Ruby-based systems where execution speed is critical.
