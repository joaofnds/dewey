JS Paint is a web-based pixel-perfect recreation of classic Microsoft Paint built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Targeting web application development and digital art domains, it implements a complete raster graphics editor with drawing tools, image manipulation capabilities, and file I/O operations. The application serves nostalgic users, digital artists, and accessibility-focused use cases by providing cross-platform paint functionality through modern web technologies. Key technical features include canvas-based rendering, touch/mobile support, theme customization, accessibility integrations (dwell clicking, speech recognition), multi-user collaboration via web sessions, and animated GIF generation from document history. It addresses the need for a lightweight, browser-based alternative to desktop paint applications while maintaining feature parity with the original MS Paint interface and functionality.
