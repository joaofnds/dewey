Seesaw is a Clojure library that provides a functional DSL wrapper around Java Swing for building desktop GUI applications. Targeting desktop application developers in the Clojure ecosystem, it abstracts away Swing's complex object-oriented APIs through idiomatic Clojure functions and data structures. The library offers declarative widget construction, CSS-style selectors, unified event handling, layout management (including MigLayout and JGoodies Forms), widget binding, and internationalization support. It solves the problem of Swing's verbose and imperative programming model by providing a more functional, data-driven approach to desktop UI development. Seesaw is designed for Clojure developers who need to create cross-platform desktop applications without requiring deep knowledge of Java Swing internals, enabling rapid GUI development through functional programming paradigms while leveraging the mature Swing widget ecosystem.
