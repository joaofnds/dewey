Seesaw is a Clojure library providing a DSL for constructing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It abstracts the complexities of Swing, enabling developers to build desktop applications with simplified syntax and features like CSS-style selectors, an extensible event API, and widget binding. The library supports a wide array of Swing widgets, layout managers, and offers conveniences for property setting, as well as integration with Clojure's reference types. Seesaw is designed to reduce the reliance on Swing knowledge, making GUI development in Clojure more accessible and efficient, and is provided as a library for Clojure projects.
