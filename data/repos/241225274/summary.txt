This repository implements a macOS screensaver that recreates the vintage Apple rainbow logo using pure Objective-C graphics programming. Built specifically for the macOS desktop application domain, it leverages NSBezierPath for vector graphics rendering and Core Graphics masking techniques to achieve pixel-perfect reproduction of the classic Apple branding with smooth animations. The screensaver targets macOS systems from Mavericks onwards and addresses the niche use case of nostalgic Apple users seeking retro desktop customization. Developed as a native macOS application using Xcode and the Cocoa framework, it demonstrates advanced 2D graphics programming techniques including path-based drawing and layer masking. The project serves Mac enthusiasts and developers interested in screensaver development, showcasing how to create custom animated screensavers using Apple's native graphics APIs without external dependencies.
