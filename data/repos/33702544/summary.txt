Dash is a Python web application framework specifically designed for building interactive data visualization dashboards and analytical web applications without requiring JavaScript knowledge. Built on Flask, React, and Plotly.js, it enables data scientists and Python developers to create reactive web interfaces that connect UI components (dropdowns, sliders, graphs) directly to Python analytical code through a declarative programming model. The framework addresses the gap between data analysis workflows and web deployment by allowing users to build production-ready data applications using pure Python, targeting domains like finance, bioinformatics, and technical computing where interactive data exploration and visualization are critical requirements.
