Dash is a Python framework for building interactive web applications, primarily focused on data science and machine learning applications. It leverages Plotly.js, React, and Flask to connect modern UI elements like charts and controls to Python code without requiring JavaScript. Key functionalities include data visualization, interactive dashboards, and the ability to create custom application layouts with features like crossfiltering and data-driven UI components. This is a web application framework, offering deployment options for both local development and enterprise-scale deployment through Dash Enterprise, with features for application management, scaling via Kubernetes, authentication, and integrations with AI/ML workflows and big data backends, targeting data scientists and developers.
