org-modern is an Emacs Lisp package that enhances the visual presentation of Org-mode buffers through advanced font locking and text properties. Targeting Emacs users and productivity enthusiasts who work extensively with Org-mode for documentation, note-taking, and project management, it modernizes the appearance of headlines, keywords, tables, source blocks, tags, and timestamps without using resource-intensive SVG images. The package leverages Emacs' native text property system and box styling to create a clean, modern aesthetic while maintaining full text editability and interaction capabilities. It addresses the problem of Org-mode's default plain-text appearance by providing configurable styling options that work harmoniously with variable-pitch and fixed-pitch fonts, making documents more visually appealing and readable for knowledge workers and developers.
