This repository provides Common Lisp source code and related materials from the textbook "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming" by Peter Norvig. It serves as a code repository for educational purposes, containing implementations of AI algorithms and techniques discussed in the book, including programs for problem-solving, natural language processing, expert systems, and logic programming. Key functionalities include interpreters, compilers, and example programs demonstrating various AI concepts. The project is structured as a collection of Lisp files that can be loaded and used with a Common Lisp environment. The target audience is primarily students, researchers, and programmers interested in learning about and implementing AI concepts in Common Lisp.
