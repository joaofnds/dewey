This repository contains the complete Common Lisp source code for Peter Norvig's seminal 1992 textbook "Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming," targeting AI researchers, computer science students, and Lisp developers. The codebase implements classic AI algorithms and paradigms including the General Problem Solver (GPS), ELIZA chatbot, symbolic mathematics systems, logic programming interpreters, expert systems, natural language processing tools, constraint satisfaction solvers, and game-playing algorithms like Othello. It serves as both educational material for learning AI programming techniques and a reference implementation of foundational AI concepts using functional programming paradigms. The repository includes auxiliary utilities, pattern matching systems, search algorithms, and knowledge representation frameworks, making it essential for understanding historical AI development and functional programming approaches to artificial intelligence problems.
