Hammy.el is an Emacs Lisp package that provides programmable interval timers for productivity management within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. It implements a domain-specific language for defining custom timer workflows, commonly used for techniques like Pomodoro time management, work-rest cycles, and break reminders. The package integrates deeply with Emacs features including mode-line display, Org-mode clock integration, notification systems, and buffer management. It targets Emacs power users, developers, and knowledge workers who spend significant time in Emacs and want to implement time-boxing methodologies without leaving their editor environment. The system supports complex timer logic with programmable intervals, automatic advancement, pause/resume functionality, and extensible actions that can trigger other Emacs Lisp functions, making it suitable for workflow automation beyond simple timing.
