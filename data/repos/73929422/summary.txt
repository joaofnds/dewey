Oni is a cross-platform modal text editor that wraps Neovim with a modern GUI built using TypeScript, React, and Redux. It targets software developers who want Vim's modal editing capabilities combined with IDE features like code completion, syntax highlighting, quick info tooltips, and integrated debugging. The editor leverages RxJS for reactive programming patterns and provides JavaScript-based plugin development instead of VimL. Oni addresses the gap between terminal-based Vim's text manipulation efficiency and modern code editors' rich development features, offering fuzzy finding, embedded browser support, and Language Server Protocol integration. The project specifically serves developers across web development, systems programming, and general software engineering who require both Vim's keyboard-driven workflow and contemporary IDE functionality without compromising on performance or cross-platform compatibility.
