`Iosevka-Comfy` is a discontinued font project providing custom builds of the Iosevka typeface, focused on visual consistency and usability. It offers multiple variants, including sans-serif and serif styles with varying spacing (monospaced, duospaced) and ligature support. The project generates TrueType font files (.ttf) through a build process that leverages the upstream Iosevka repository, npm for dependency management, and build plans defined in TOML format. It is a collection of font files with the primary purpose to replace the default Iosevka typeface. The project is intended for users who want to customize the appearance of their text within various applications.
