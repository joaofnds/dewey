before.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that extends the editor's built-in changelist functionality by tracking edit locations across multiple buffers and providing navigation between them. Targeted at software developers and text editor power users, it addresses the limitation of Neovim's native changelist being restricted to single buffers, enabling cross-buffer edit history traversal. The plugin integrates with the Neovim ecosystem through telescope.nvim for fuzzy finding previous edit locations and quickfix lists for structured navigation. It maintains a configurable in-memory history of edit positions with wraparound support, solving the common developer workflow problem of quickly returning to recently modified code locations across different files during active development sessions.
