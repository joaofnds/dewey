Onefetch is a command-line Git repository analysis tool written in Rust that provides comprehensive project information and code statistics for local Git repositories without requiring network connectivity. Targeting software developers and DevOps engineers across all programming domains, it analyzes repository metadata to display code distribution, contributor statistics, lines of code, dependency counts, license detection, and project metrics directly in the terminal. The tool supports over 100 programming languages and offers customizable ASCII art output, multiple export formats (JSON, YAML), and extensive configuration options through command-line flags. It solves the problem of quickly obtaining detailed repository insights and project overviews during development workflows, serving as an enhanced alternative to basic git status commands for developers who need rapid project assessment and documentation.
