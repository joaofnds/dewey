`onefetch` is a command-line tool written in Rust designed to display Git repository information directly in the terminal. It provides project statistics such as code distribution, license detection, pending changes, dependencies, contributors, size on disk, and lines of code (LOC).  Users can customize the output via command-line flags, including formatting options, and format the output in JSON or YAML.  This standalone CLI application targets developers and utilizes Rust to deliver a performant and offline Git information display solution.
