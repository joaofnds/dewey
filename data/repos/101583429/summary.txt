graph.el is a graph layout and visualization library written in Emacs Lisp that renders hierarchical data structures as ASCII text diagrams within the Emacs editor environment. Targeting Emacs developers and data visualization use cases, it ports algorithms from the Clojure vijual library to provide tree and graph layout capabilities specifically for the Emacs ecosystem. The library solves the problem of visualizing complex nested data structures, organizational hierarchies, and tree-based data directly within Emacs buffers using customizable text rendering. Currently supporting trees and binary trees with planned expansion to directed and undirected graphs, it serves Emacs power users, Lisp developers, and anyone needing in-editor data structure visualization without external dependencies or graphical rendering engines.
