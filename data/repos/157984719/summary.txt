gitbatch is a command-line Git repository management tool written in Go that enables batch operations across multiple Git repositories from a single interface. Targeting DevOps engineers and software developers who maintain numerous local repositories, it provides a terminal-based UI for performing common Git operations like pulling updates, committing changes, stashing, and status checking across multiple projects simultaneously. The application leverages go-git for Git operations, gocui for the terminal user interface, viper for configuration management, and integrates with native Git commands for full functionality. It addresses the inefficiency of manually managing Git operations across multiple repositories by centralizing repository management into a single interactive batch processing tool, particularly useful for developers working on microservices architectures or maintaining multiple project codebases.
