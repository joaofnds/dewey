`gitbatch` is a Go-based command-line application designed for managing multiple Git repositories concurrently. Its core functionality revolves around batch operations such as pulling updates and performing other Git commands across numerous repositories from a single interface. Utilizing the `gocui` library for its user interface, it incorporates `go-git` for a Git interface, `viper` for configuration, and `kingpin` for command-line flag parsing. This project is a standalone CLI tool targeting developers working with multiple Git repositories who require enhanced productivity through streamlined batch operations.
