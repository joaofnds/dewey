Active Delivery is a Ruby notification framework designed for Rails web applications that provides a unified abstraction layer for managing multiple notification channels (email, push notifications, SMS, webhooks) through a single interface. It wraps ActionMailer and integrates with AbstractNotifier to consolidate notification logic, replacing scattered conditional notification code with centralized delivery classes that follow Rails naming conventions. The framework supports asynchronous delivery via ActiveJob, custom resolver patterns for different notifier types, and improved testability through unified notification handling. Targeted at Ruby on Rails developers building web applications with complex notification requirements, it simplifies notification architecture by decoupling business logic from specific delivery mechanisms while maintaining compatibility with existing Rails notification infrastructure.
