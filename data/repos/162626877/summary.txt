`active_delivery` is a Ruby framework designed to provide a unified interface for managing various notification types, including mailers and push notifications within Ruby on Rails applications. It centralizes notification logic, enabling better testability and organization of notification-related code. The framework employs a delivery class abstraction and supports custom "lines" for different notification channels, offering a flexible architecture based on Action Mailer conventions with parameterized deliveries, callback support, and built-in testing utilities using RSpec and Minitest. This is a Ruby library intended for developers building Rails applications that require a streamlined approach to handling user notifications.
