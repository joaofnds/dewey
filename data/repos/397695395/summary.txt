Eva is an Emacs Lisp-based virtual assistant framework designed for quantified self enthusiasts and productivity optimization within the Emacs ecosystem. Built around Org-mode integration, it provides automatic activity logging through buffer tracking and idleness detection, user polling for mood/habit data collection, and reminder systems for tasks and agenda items. The system maintains persistent memory state and aims to minimize decision fatigue through presumptive automation and intelligent prompting. Eva targets Emacs power users seeking automated time tracking and self-monitoring without manual intervention. The framework includes extensible functions for custom data collection, integrates with existing Org-mode workflows, and is designed as a foundation for building personalized productivity assistants rather than a monolithic solution.
