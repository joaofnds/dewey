JSON Crack is an open-source web application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript that provides interactive visualization and manipulation of structured data formats including JSON, YAML, XML, CSV, and TOML. The application transforms textual data into interactive graph representations using Reaflow for visualization and Monaco Editor for code editing, enabling developers and data professionals to explore, validate, format, and convert between different data formats. It offers advanced features like TypeScript interface generation, Golang struct creation, JSON Schema validation, JWT decoding, and jq query execution, with all processing performed client-side for privacy. The tool addresses common developer workflows in web development, API design, and data analysis by providing a unified interface for data format manipulation and visualization without requiring server-side data transmission.
