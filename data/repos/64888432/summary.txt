`dlv` is a minimal JavaScript utility library that provides safe deep property access for nested objects using dot notation or array keypaths. Targeting web developers working with complex data structures, this 120-byte module prevents runtime errors when traversing object hierarchies by gracefully handling undefined intermediate properties and returning configurable default values. The library supports ES Modules, CommonJS, and global environments, making it suitable for both Node.js backend applications and browser-based frontend development. It solves the common problem of safely accessing deeply nested object properties without throwing TypeError exceptions, eliminating the need for verbose conditional checks or optional chaining polyfills in JavaScript applications that manipulate JSON data, API responses, or configuration objects.
