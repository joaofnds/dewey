`prescient.el` is an Emacs Lisp library providing efficient sorting and filtering capabilities for Emacs completion frameworks such as Ivy, Company, Corfu, Vertico, and Selectrum. Its core functionality involves sorting candidates based on recency, frequency, and length, coupled with a filtering system employing multiple methods including substring, regexp, and initialism matching, enhancing completion speed and predictability. Extension packages integrate `prescient.el` with various Emacs completion systems, offering configurable filtering styles and sorting behaviors. This project is a library designed to improve the Emacs user experience by enhancing completion candidate management, particularly for developers using Emacs as a primary text editor.
