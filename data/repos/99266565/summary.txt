`prescient.el` is an Emacs Lisp library that provides intelligent sorting and filtering algorithms for completion frameworks in the Emacs text editor ecosystem. It integrates with popular Emacs completion systems including Ivy, Company, Vertico, Corfu, Selectrum, and Icomplete through dedicated extension packages. The library implements frequency-based and recency-based ranking using statistical analysis of user selection patterns, combined with flexible filtering methods including substring matching, regex matching, and initialism matching (e.g., "ffap" matching "find-file-at-point"). It maintains persistent usage statistics across Emacs sessions and supports configurable decay rates for frequency scoring. The target users are Emacs power users, developers, and system administrators who rely on Emacs for code editing and want enhanced autocomplete and candidate selection experiences with predictive ranking based on historical usage patterns.
