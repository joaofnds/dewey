Gmail-to-SQLite is a Python application that indexes Gmail messages into a local SQLite database for data analysis and archival purposes. Built for data scientists and analysts, it leverages the Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 authentication to perform incremental or full synchronization of email data. The tool features multi-threaded processing, exponential backoff retry logic, and comprehensive error handling for robust data extraction. It stores structured email metadata including sender/recipient information, labels, timestamps, and message content in a queryable SQLite schema with JSON fields. Primary use cases include email analytics, personal data archiving, and research workflows requiring SQL-based analysis of Gmail communication patterns and content.
