OkHttp is a high-performance HTTP client library for JVM, Android, and GraalVM platforms, written in Kotlin and targeting mobile and backend developers. It implements modern HTTP specifications including HTTP/2, WebSockets, and server-sent events, providing efficient networking through connection pooling, transparent GZIP compression, response caching, and automatic recovery from connection failures. The library offers both synchronous and asynchronous APIs with fluent builder patterns for constructing requests and handling responses. Built on Okio for high-performance I/O operations, OkHttp supports TLS 1.3, certificate pinning, and integrates with security providers like Conscrypt/BoringSSL, making it essential infrastructure for Android applications and Java-based services requiring robust HTTP communication capabilities.
