RUTILS is a comprehensive utility library for Common Lisp that provides syntactic enhancements and developer productivity tools for Lisp programmers. It targets Common Lisp developers working in both REPL-driven development and large-scale system development, offering a "modern" readtable with literal syntax for hash-tables, lambdas, and heredoc-strings, along with extensive collection manipulation utilities for lists, hash-tables, sequences, arrays, and strings. The library includes essential Lisp macros like WITH-GENSYMS and ONCE-ONLY, anaphoric macros, Clojure-style threading operators (-> and ->>), generic data structure access via GENERIC-ELT, and an ITER macro with keyword support. Built on NAMED-READTABLES and CLOSER-MOP dependencies, RUTILS solves the problem of verbose Common Lisp syntax by providing abbreviations, literal notations, and streamlined utilities that radically simplify day-to-day Lisp programming tasks without covering concurrency, functional programming paradigms, or advanced collections.
