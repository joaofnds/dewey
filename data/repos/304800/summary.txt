`rutils` is a Common Lisp library providing radical syntactic utilities and macro-based extensions to simplify Lisp programming, particularly for REPL-driven development and system development.  It introduces novel literal notations and abbreviations while offering an extensive suite of utilities for common tasks, including list, hash-table, sequence, array, string, and tree manipulation, along with generic access and Clojure-style threading macros.  Key dependencies include `NAMED-READTABLES` and `CLOSER-MOP`.  This is a library project designed to enhance developer productivity within the Common Lisp environment.
