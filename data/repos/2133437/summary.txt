Projectile is an Emacs Lisp library designed to enhance project interaction within the Emacs text editor. It provides project-level features such as file navigation, buffer management, code searching, and command execution (e.g., grep, make) tailored to the active project. Core functionalities include rapid file and test switching, project-aware completion, and integration with popular minibuffer completion systems. This project is a plugin/library leveraging Emacs Lisp, with an architectural focus on portability and extensibility for Emacs users managing code projects.
