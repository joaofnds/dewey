Martian is an HTTP abstraction library for Clojure/ClojureScript that simplifies API client development by generating type-safe client interfaces from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. It eliminates manual HTTP request construction by automatically handling URL building, route parameters, query parameters, request encoding, and validation through an interceptor-based architecture. The library supports multiple HTTP client implementations (clj-http, hato, httpkit) across JVM, JavaScript, and Babashka environments, with specialized modules for re-frame integration and testing workflows. Targeted at Clojure web developers building microservices and API-driven applications, Martian reduces boilerplate code and prevents runtime errors by leveraging API schemas for compile-time validation. It includes martian-test for mock testing and martian-vcr for HTTP interaction recording, making it particularly valuable for teams maintaining multiple API integrations in distributed systems.
