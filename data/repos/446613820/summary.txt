dsq is a command-line tool written in Go that enables SQL querying across heterogeneous data formats including JSON, CSV, Excel, Parquet, TSV, and OpenOffice Calc files. Built on SQLite as its SQL engine, it targets data scientists, analysts, and developers who need to perform ad-hoc data analysis and transformation tasks without importing data into dedicated databases. The tool supports complex operations like multi-file joins, nested object querying with JSON path notation, piped data processing, and schema inference. Users can output results as JSON or ASCII tables, leverage caching for performance, and access an interactive REPL mode. The project addresses the common data engineering challenge of querying structured data across different file formats using familiar SQL syntax, eliminating the need for format-specific tools or ETL processes for exploratory data analysis workflows.
