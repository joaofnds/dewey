Bullet is a Ruby gem designed for web application performance optimization in Rails and MongoDB environments, specifically targeting N+1 query problems and inefficient eager loading patterns. It provides real-time database query monitoring and analysis for Ruby on Rails applications using ActiveRecord (4.0+) and Mongoid (4.0+) ORMs. The gem integrates into development workflows to detect when developers should add eager loading to eliminate N+1 queries, identify unnecessary eager loading that wastes resources, and recommend counter cache implementations. It offers multiple notification channels including browser alerts, console logging, integration with error tracking services (Sentry, Honeybadger, Airbrake), and communication platforms (Slack, XMPP). Targeted at Rails developers and web application engineers, Bullet serves as a development-time profiling tool to identify and resolve database performance bottlenecks before they reach production environments.
