Bullet is a Ruby gem designed to optimize ActiveRecord and Mongoid applications by identifying and alerting developers to potential performance bottlenecks. It detects N+1 query problems, unused eager loading, and situations where counter caches should be employed. The gem integrates with development environments, providing notifications through browser alerts, console logging, Rails log entries, and integrations with various notification services (e.g., XMPP, Slack, Honeybadger). Bullet is a developer productivity tool, primarily a library, intended for Ruby on Rails developers to enhance the performance and efficiency of their database interactions within their applications.
