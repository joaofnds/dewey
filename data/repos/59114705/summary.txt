Cleave.js is a JavaScript input formatting library designed for web developers to automatically format user input text as they type. The library specializes in real-time formatting of credit card numbers, phone numbers (with internationalization), dates, and numerals within HTML input fields. Built using vanilla JavaScript with support for CommonJS, AMD, and ES modules, it provides React components, AngularJS directives, and TypeScript definitions for seamless integration into modern web applications. The library addresses the common frontend development challenge of improving input field UX without requiring complex regular expressions or custom masking logic, targeting web developers building forms and data entry interfaces that need consistent, readable input formatting across different data types.
