Cleave.js is a JavaScript library designed to automatically format input text content, primarily for user input fields in web applications. It provides features for formatting credit card numbers, phone numbers (with i18n support), dates, and numerals, employing custom delimiters, prefixes, and block patterns to enhance readability. The library supports common module formats (CommonJS, AMD, ES Module) and frameworks including ReactJS and AngularJS via dedicated components and directives, respectively, with TypeScript type definitions available. Primarily a frontend developer utility, it streamlines input formatting tasks and improves user experience in web forms.
