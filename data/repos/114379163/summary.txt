rivo/tview is a comprehensive Go library for building terminal-based user interfaces (TUIs), targeting developers creating command-line applications across DevOps, system administration, and CLI tooling domains. The library provides rich interactive widgets including input forms, navigable tables, tree views, text areas, modal dialogs, and flexible layout systems (grid, flexbox) that render directly in terminal environments. Built specifically for Go applications, it serves as a foundation for sophisticated terminal applications like Kubernetes management tools (K9s), database browsers, file managers, and monitoring dashboards. The library addresses the need for professional-grade terminal interfaces beyond basic CLI tools, enabling developers to create full-featured TUI applications with complex interactions, multiple views, and responsive layouts while maintaining cross-platform terminal compatibility.
