Tilex is a knowledge-sharing web application built with Elixir and Phoenix Framework that enables development teams to catalog and share short-form technical learnings. The system implements a "Today I Learned" (TIL) platform with 200-word post limits, Google OAuth authentication via Ueberauth, PostgreSQL database persistence, and deployment to Heroku. It serves the web development and software engineering domain by providing a structured way for development teams to document and disseminate incremental technical knowledge, insights, and discoveries. The application targets software developers, engineering teams, and technical consultancies who want to systematically capture and share daily learning experiences. Originally migrated from a Ruby on Rails implementation, it demonstrates modern Elixir web development practices while solving the problem of knowledge silos within development organizations through lightweight, accessible technical content sharing.
