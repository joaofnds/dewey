Sail was a developer tooling solution that automated the creation of containerized VS Code development environments for software projects. Built in Go with Docker integration, it enabled developers to launch pre-configured, reproducible development environments directly from GitHub/GitLab repositories through browser extensions or CLI commands. The tool addressed environment consistency issues in software development teams by allowing projects to define their development stack (dependencies, tooling, configuration) as code, eliminating "works on my machine" problems. Targeting software developers and development teams across web development, backend services, and general programming projects, Sail provided instant workspace provisioning with VS Code (via code-server) running in Docker containers, ensuring all team members worked in identical environments regardless of their local machine setup.
