FitNesse is a Java-based acceptance testing framework that combines a wiki-style interface with automated test execution capabilities for software development teams. It serves the software testing and quality assurance domain by enabling collaborative creation and maintenance of acceptance tests through a web-based wiki interface. The framework integrates test documentation with executable test cases, allowing business stakeholders and developers to define requirements as living documentation that can be automatically verified against the system under test. Built with Java and distributed via Maven Central, FitNesse targets development teams practicing behavior-driven development (BDD) and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) methodologies. It solves the common problem of maintaining synchronization between business requirements, test documentation, and automated test execution by providing a unified platform where specifications serve as both documentation and executable tests, making it particularly valuable for agile development environments requiring continuous stakeholder collaboration.
