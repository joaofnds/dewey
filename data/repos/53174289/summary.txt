Terratest is a Go-based testing library designed for infrastructure-as-code validation and automated testing in the DevOps domain. It provides helper functions and patterns for testing Terraform configurations, Packer templates, Docker images, and Helm charts, while supporting integration with major cloud platforms including AWS, Azure, and GCP APIs. The library enables infrastructure engineers and DevOps teams to write automated tests that can execute SSH commands on servers, make HTTP requests, interact with Kubernetes clusters, and run shell commands for comprehensive infrastructure validation. Terratest addresses the critical need for reliable, repeatable testing of infrastructure deployments before production, allowing teams to catch configuration errors and validate infrastructure behavior programmatically rather than through manual testing processes.
