The `snyk/cli` repository provides a command-line interface (CLI) for the Snyk platform, enabling security vulnerability scanning and monitoring of software projects. Built with TypeScript, the CLI supports scanning for open-source vulnerabilities, application code issues, container image security flaws, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configuration problems. Functionality includes scanning projects, monitoring for new vulnerabilities, and providing remediation guidance. This standalone application is primarily used by developers to integrate security testing into their development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
