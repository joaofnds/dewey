The Snyk CLI is a TypeScript-based command-line security tool that integrates vulnerability scanning into development workflows for DevOps and security teams. It provides automated security analysis across four domains: open-source dependencies (Snyk Open Source), application source code (Snyk Code), container images and Kubernetes deployments (Snyk Container), and infrastructure-as-code configurations in Terraform/Kubernetes (Snyk IaC). The CLI supports multiple package managers, programming languages, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines and IDEs to identify, monitor, and remediate security vulnerabilities throughout the software development lifecycle. Target users include developers, DevOps engineers, and security professionals who need to implement shift-left security practices by scanning projects locally or in automated build processes.
