Evilginx2 is a standalone man-in-the-middle attack framework written in Go that implements reverse proxy phishing techniques to intercept login credentials and session cookies, effectively bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) protections. The tool operates in the cybersecurity and penetration testing domain, featuring built-in HTTP and DNS servers that proxy traffic between victims and legitimate websites while capturing authentication tokens. It targets security professionals, red team operators, and penetration testers conducting authorized security assessments. The framework uses configurable "phishlets" to define proxying rules for specific target services, enabling real-time credential harvesting and session hijacking attacks that traditional phishing methods cannot achieve due to modern 2FA implementations.
