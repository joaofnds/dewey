Passport is an Express-compatible authentication middleware library for Node.js web applications that provides a modular, strategy-based approach to user authentication. It serves the web development domain by offering a lightweight, unopinionated framework that integrates with various authentication protocols including OAuth, OAuth2, OpenID, OpenID Connect, and SAML through extensible plugins called strategies. The library abstracts authentication logic without imposing specific routing or database schema requirements, allowing developers to maintain architectural flexibility while implementing secure user login systems. Passport primarily solves the complexity of integrating multiple authentication providers and protocols into Node.js/Express applications, targeting backend developers who need to implement authentication flows for web applications and APIs without being locked into specific implementation patterns or data storage solutions.
