XGo is an AI-native programming language built in Go that serves as a simplified, educational alternative to Go while maintaining full compatibility with the Go ecosystem. Targeting STEM education, data science, and engineering domains, XGo introduces Python-like syntax simplifications including command-style function calls, string interpolation with `${expr}`, simplified list/map literals, and lambda expressions using `=>` syntax. The language eliminates boilerplate code by allowing omission of `package main` and `func main`, while providing enhanced list operations with `<-` append syntax and built-in functions like `echo`. XGo supports hybrid Go/XGo programming within the same package, integrates with C/Python libraries through LLGo, and offers domain-specific friendliness through classfiles and domain text literals, making it suitable for educators, students, data scientists, and engineers seeking a more approachable systems programming language.
