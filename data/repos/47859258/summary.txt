The `goplus/gop` repository provides the Go+ programming language, designed for engineering, STEM education, and data science. Go+ extends Go with features simplifying syntax for improved readability and ease of use, including command-style code, list and mapping literals, and simplified expression of common tasks. It supports hybrid Go/Go+ programming, integrates with the C ecosystem through LLGo, enabling access to C/C++ and Python libraries, and offers a classfile system for abstracting domain knowledge. Go+ is a standalone programming language and ecosystem, with related tools like a web framework (YAP), a 2D game engine (SPX), and DevOps utilities, targeting engineers, educators, and data scientists.
