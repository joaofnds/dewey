Reagent is a ClojureScript library that provides a minimalistic interface to React.js for building web frontend applications. It enables functional programming developers to create React components using ClojureScript functions and Hiccup-style markup syntax instead of JSX, bridging the gap between React's component model and Clojure's functional paradigms. The library features reactive state management through Reagent atoms that automatically trigger component re-renders when dereferenced, eliminating manual state synchronization. Targeted at ClojureScript developers in web development, Reagent compiles to JavaScript and integrates with the React ecosystem while maintaining functional programming principles. It supports React 18 compatibility mode and works with various React renderers, offering an alternative to traditional JavaScript-based React development for teams preferring Lisp-based functional programming approaches in frontend web applications.
