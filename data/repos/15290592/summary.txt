Reagent is a ClojureScript interface designed to create React.js components using ClojureScript functions, enabling the development of frontend web applications. It provides a concise and efficient way to write React components using Hiccup-like markup instead of JSX, offering features such as component state management with Reagent's atom implementation, and lifecycle methods through metadata attachment to component functions. This library allows for automatic re-rendering of components when atom values change, leveraging ClojureScript's strengths for performant rendering and is intended for frontend developers seeking a ClojureScript-based approach to React development. The project is a ClojureScript library that integrates with React, offering a component-based frontend development approach.
