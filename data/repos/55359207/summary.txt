The `cmalcor` project is a standalone C++ application designed to customize the LED color of the CM Storm Alcor gaming mouse, which lacks native color control. It allows users to select custom RGB colors, brightness, and LED modes via a Windows GUI or a Linux CLI, interacting with the mouse through USB commands. The application supports both GUI and CLI interfaces on Windows, and a CLI interface on Linux utilizing the `hidapi` library. This project provides functionality to restore LED color settings on Windows startup and includes troubleshooting steps for potential issues related to firmware limitations and flash memory endurance.
