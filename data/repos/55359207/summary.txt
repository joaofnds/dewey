This C++ application enables LED color customization for CoolerMaster CM Storm Alcor gaming mice by exploiting shared firmware with the Mizar model that officially supports LED control. The tool communicates directly with the USB HID device to send RGB color commands, bypassing the lack of official software support for the Alcor. It provides both Windows GUI (requiring .NET Framework 4.5) and cross-platform CLI interfaces, with Linux support via hidapi. The application targets PC gaming enthusiasts and hardware modders who want to customize their peripheral RGB lighting. Key features include real-time color changes, brightness control, LED mode selection, color palette storage, and Windows startup restoration. The solution addresses hardware vendor software limitations through reverse-engineered USB protocol communication and firmware manipulation.
