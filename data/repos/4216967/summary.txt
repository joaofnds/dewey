StumpWM is a tiling window manager written entirely in Common Lisp, targeting system administrators, power users, and developers who prefer keyboard-driven desktop environments. It operates in the Linux/Unix X11 ecosystem, managing application windows through programmatic tiling layouts rather than traditional floating windows with GUI decorations. The system eliminates conventional desktop elements like title bars, buttons, and toolbars, instead providing a text-based, keyboard-controlled interface similar to Emacs or GNU Screen. Built on dependencies including SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp), CLX (Common Lisp X11 interface), and cl-ppcre for pattern matching, StumpWM offers extensive customization through Lisp scripting. It addresses the need for highly efficient, programmable window management in developer-focused workflows where mouse interaction is minimized and workspace organization is automated through code.
