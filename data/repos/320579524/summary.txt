GO Feature Flag is a self-hosted feature flag management system written in Go, designed for DevOps and continuous deployment workflows. The library enables developers to implement feature toggles and A/B testing capabilities in applications, supporting multiple programming languages through OpenFeature standardization and a relay proxy API server. It provides flexible flag configuration storage across various backends (HTTP, S3, Kubernetes) with support for JSON, TOML, and YAML formats. The system offers complex user targeting rules, rollout strategies, and real-time flag evaluation without requiring external SaaS dependencies. Targeted at software engineers and DevOps teams implementing continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines, it facilitates controlled feature releases, experimentation, and risk mitigation in production environments through programmatic feature toggling and gradual rollout mechanisms.
