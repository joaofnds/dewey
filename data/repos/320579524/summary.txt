`go-feature-flag` is a self-hosted, open-source feature flag solution providing a lightweight, complete implementation primarily for Go applications, but also supporting multiple languages via an Open Feature API proxy. The project enables developers to manage feature toggles, facilitating continuous delivery and experimentation through functionalities such as flag evaluation, A/B testing, scheduled rollouts, and data export.  It allows users to store configuration in various formats (YAML, JSON, TOML) and locations (file, HTTP, cloud storage), leveraging Go as its core language and utilizing libraries for rule parsing and integration with various cloud platforms and notification services like Slack and Webhooks. The project provides both a Go module and Open Feature SDKs and is a developer productivity tool primarily targeting DevOps and backend developers.
