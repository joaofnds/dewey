libqrencode is a C library designed for encoding data into QR Code symbols, implementing the QR Code model 2 specification (JIS X0510:2004/ISO/IEC 18004). The library generates raw bitmap arrays rather than image files, allowing developers to directly integrate QR Code generation into applications across mobile, web, and embedded systems domains. It supports multiple encoding modes including numeric, alphanumeric, Japanese kanji (Shift-JIS), and 8-bit binary data, with optimized encoding algorithms and structured-append capabilities. The library includes experimental Micro QR Code support and a command-line utility for generating QR Code images in various formats. Built with minimal dependencies (core library is dependency-free), it targets software developers needing efficient QR Code generation functionality in C/C++ applications, embedded systems, and cross-platform projects requiring fast, compact QR Code encoding capabilities.
