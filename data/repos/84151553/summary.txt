**yj** is a Go-based CLI tool that performs bidirectional data format conversion between YAML v1.2, TOML v1.0.0, JSON (RFC 7159), and HCL v1 configuration files while preserving map key ordering. Built for DevOps, infrastructure-as-code, and configuration management workflows, it addresses the common need to transform configuration data between different serialization formats used across various tools and platforms. The tool leverages standard Go libraries (encoding/json) and established third-party packages (gopkg.in/yaml.v3, github.com/BurntSushi/toml, github.com/hashicorp/hcl) to ensure format compliance. Target users include DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers working with configuration files, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure-as-Code tools like Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, and multi-format configuration management systems requiring seamless data interchange.
