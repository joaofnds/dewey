`yj` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Go for converting between YAML, TOML, JSON, and HCL data formats while preserving map order. Functionality includes format conversion via stdin or file input, with options for indentation, HTML escaping (JSON output), and handling of special numeric values. The project provides binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows, as well as a Docker image, and also offers a Go package exposing the conversion logic for integration into other Go projects. The target audience is likely developers and system administrators who require data format conversions in their workflows.
