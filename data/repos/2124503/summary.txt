`clojure.math.combinatorics` is a functional Clojure library providing efficient, lazy-sequence algorithms for mathematical combinatorial operations including permutations, combinations, subsets, cartesian products, selections, and partitions. Targeting mathematics, computer science, and data analysis domains, it offers optimized functions for generating and manipulating combinatorial sequences with intelligent handling of duplicate elements and multiset operations. The library includes performance-optimized utilities like `count-permutations`, `nth-combination`, and `permutation-index` that avoid full sequence computation. Designed for Clojure developers working on algorithmic problems, statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, or any application requiring systematic enumeration of discrete mathematical structures, it serves as a foundational tool for combinatorial computing in functional programming environments.
