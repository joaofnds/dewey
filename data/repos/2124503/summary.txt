`clojure.math.combinatorics` is a Clojure library providing efficient, functional algorithms for generating lazy sequences related to combinatorial functions.  It offers functions for permutations, combinations, subsets, cartesian products, selections, and partitions, handling duplicate items intelligently and providing optimized counting/nth access.  The library utilizes Clojure and returns lazy sequences to enhance performance.  This is a library intended for Clojure developers needing combinatorial tools.
