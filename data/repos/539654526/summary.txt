**noice.nvim** is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that completely replaces the default UI components for messages, command line interface, and popup menus within the Neovim text editor. Targeting software developers and power users in the code editor customization domain, it leverages Neovim's experimental `vim.ui_attach` API along with dependencies like nui.nvim for rendering, nvim-notify for notifications, and nvim-treesitter for syntax highlighting. The plugin addresses the limitation of Neovim's default messaging system by providing configurable views, message routing through filters, preserved syntax highlighting, and enhanced command line experience with icons and real-time syntax highlighting for Vim and Lua commands. It eliminates the traditional "more-prompt" interruptions and integrates with telescope.nvim and fzf-lua for searchable message history, primarily serving developers who extensively customize their Neovim development environment.
