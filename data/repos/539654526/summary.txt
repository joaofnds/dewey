`folke/noice.nvim` is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that fundamentally alters the user interface for messages, the command line, and the popup menu. It provides highly configurable views, including splits, popups, and virtual text, for displaying messages and command output. Key features include message filtering and routing, preservation of message highlights, a customizable cmdline with syntax highlighting, and integration with tools like Telescope and FzfLua for message history. This plugin is designed as a developer productivity tool, heavily utilizing the Neovim UI attach API and dependent on libraries such as `nui.nvim` and, optionally, `nvim-notify` and `nvim-treesitter`.
