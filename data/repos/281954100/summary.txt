The nvim-treesitter/playground is a deprecated Neovim plugin that provided interactive visualization and debugging tools for Tree-sitter parsers within the editor environment. Written in Lua, it enabled developers to inspect abstract syntax trees (AST), highlight groups, and syntax nodes in real-time, along with a query editor for writing and testing Tree-sitter queries with live preview capabilities. The plugin included a query linter for validating Tree-sitter query syntax and omnifunc completions for query development. Targeted at plugin developers, language tool creators, and advanced Neovim users working with syntax highlighting and code analysis, it solved the problem of debugging Tree-sitter grammars and understanding parser behavior. The functionality has since been integrated directly into Neovim core through commands like `:InspectTree`, `:Inspect`, and `:EditQuery`, making this standalone plugin obsolete.
