`core.async` is a Clojure library providing asynchronous programming facilities, primarily focused on concurrent communication and data flow within Clojure and ClojureScript applications. It introduces channels, go blocks (using the `go` macro), and related operations to manage concurrent processes, handling communication and synchronization. This library enables developers to write asynchronous and reactive code, including support for transducers, with features like `alts!` for concurrent operation selection. A library, it targets Clojure and ClojureScript developers seeking to build concurrent and responsive applications, leveraging the Clojure language's functional and immutable data structures.
