core.async is a Clojure library that provides asynchronous programming primitives and communication mechanisms through channels, modeled after Go's concurrency approach. It implements Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) patterns with channels for message passing, go blocks for lightweight threading, and async/await-style operations. The library targets Clojure and ClojureScript developers building concurrent applications, web services, reactive systems, and event-driven architectures where non-blocking I/O and coordinated communication between independent processes are essential. It solves the problem of managing complex asynchronous workflows without callback hell or traditional thread-based concurrency issues, offering higher-level abstractions like alts (select operations), timeouts, and buffered channels for building scalable, maintainable concurrent systems in functional programming environments.
