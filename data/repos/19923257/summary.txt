Exordium is a comprehensive Emacs configuration framework designed to transform Emacs into a full-featured IDE for C++ and Lisp/Clojure development. Built entirely in Emacs Lisp, it integrates essential development tools including Projectile for project management, Magit for Git operations, LSP for language server protocol support, and specialized C++ formatting utilities for Bloomberg's BDE code style. The framework incorporates completion engines (Company, Auto Complete), navigation tools (Helm, IDO, Avy), and syntax highlighting via Treesitter, targeting experienced developers who prefer Emacs over traditional IDEs. It addresses the complexity of configuring Emacs for modern software development by providing a modular, portable configuration that works across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, specifically optimized for systems programming and functional programming workflows.
