vim-abolish is a Vim editor plugin that provides advanced text manipulation capabilities for developers working with code refactoring and text editing tasks. Written in Vim Script, it addresses three core functions: intelligent abbreviation expansion that handles multiple word variants and case forms simultaneously, sophisticated search-and-replace operations using brace expansion syntax for batch substitutions across different word forms (singular/plural, case variants), and case coercion commands that convert between naming conventions like camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, and UPPER_CASE. The plugin primarily serves software developers, technical writers, and anyone performing extensive text manipulation in Vim, solving the tedious problem of manually handling multiple word variants during code refactoring, spell correction, and variable naming convention changes across codebases.
