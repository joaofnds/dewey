`futures-rs` is a Rust library providing foundational components for zero-cost asynchronous programming. It defines key traits like `Stream` and offers utilities such as `join!` and `select!`, along with various combinator methods, enabling expressive asynchronous control flow. This library facilitates the development of concurrent applications by enabling asynchronous operations and is a crucial component for building reactive and non-blocking systems in Rust. It targets Rust developers seeking to implement efficient and scalable concurrent code, functioning as a core building block for asynchronous applications and frameworks within the Rust ecosystem.
