The `futures-rs` repository provides foundational asynchronous programming primitives for Rust, serving as the core infrastructure for async/await functionality in the language ecosystem. This library targets systems programming, web development, and network service domains where non-blocking I/O and concurrent execution are critical. It implements key traits like `Stream` and `Future`, along with utilities such as `join!`, `select!` macros and combinator methods for composing asynchronous operations. The library enables zero-cost abstractions for async programming, supports `#[no_std]` environments for embedded systems, and solves the fundamental problem of efficient concurrent programming without runtime overhead. It primarily serves Rust developers building async applications, web servers, network services, and embedded systems requiring high-performance asynchronous execution patterns.
