**vim-pathogen** is a Vim script plugin manager that simplifies `runtimepath` manipulation for organizing and loading Vim plugins from individual directories. Targeting software developers and system administrators who use Vim as their primary text editor, it addresses the pre-Vim 8 challenge of managing multiple plugins by automatically loading them from a `~/.vim/bundle` directory structure. The tool provides runtime path manipulation functions, automatic help tag generation via `:Helptags`, and supports custom directory configurations through glob patterns. Written entirely in Vim Script, pathogen.vim serves as a lightweight package manager that predates Vim's native package management system, enabling developers to maintain clean, modular Vim configurations with Git submodules and organized plugin hierarchies for enhanced development workflows.
