Clair is an open-source vulnerability scanner designed for static security analysis of container images in DevOps and container orchestration environments. Built in Go, it provides REST API endpoints for indexing OCI and Docker container images and matching them against known vulnerability databases. The system targets DevOps engineers, security teams, and platform administrators managing Kubernetes clusters and container registries who need automated vulnerability assessment in CI/CD pipelines. Clair integrates with container infrastructure tooling like Quay registry and supports both OCI Image Specification and Docker image formats. It addresses the critical security challenge of identifying known vulnerabilities in container layers before deployment, enabling proactive security scanning as part of container image build and deployment workflows in cloud-native environments.
