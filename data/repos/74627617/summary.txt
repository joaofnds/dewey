openpilot is an open-source robotics operating system that provides advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionality for over 300 supported vehicle models. Built primarily in Python, it implements autonomous driving capabilities including adaptive cruise control, lane keeping, and traffic-aware cruise control through computer vision and machine learning models. The system runs on comma.ai's dedicated hardware (comma 3/3X devices) that connects to a vehicle's CAN bus via custom harnesses, enabling real-time vehicle control and sensor data processing. It follows ISO26262 automotive safety standards with safety-critical code implemented in C within the panda firmware. The platform targets automotive enthusiasts, researchers, and developers working on autonomous vehicle technology, providing a comprehensive software stack for retrofitting existing cars with self-driving capabilities.
