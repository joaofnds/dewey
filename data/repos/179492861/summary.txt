HTTPX is a Python library providing a next-generation HTTP client with both synchronous and asynchronous APIs, and integrated command-line interface. This project facilitates HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests with a requests-compatible API, supporting features such as connection pooling, SSL verification, and WSGI/ASGI application integration. Leveraging `asyncio` and `trio` for asynchronous operations, it depends on libraries like `httpcore`, `certifi`, and `idna`. This is a developer productivity library focused on providing an HTTP client for Python applications.
