HTTPX is a modern HTTP client library for Python 3.8+ that serves as an enhanced alternative to the popular `requests` library. Built for web developers and backend engineers, it provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs using asyncio and trio frameworks, supporting HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols. The library addresses limitations in existing HTTP clients by offering native async/await support, strict timeout handling, full type annotations, and direct integration with WSGI/ASGI applications for testing. Core dependencies include httpcore for transport, h11 for HTTP/1.1, and optional h2 for HTTP/2 support. HTTPX maintains requests-compatible APIs while adding modern Python features like async context managers, making it ideal for contemporary web applications, API integrations, microservices, and async web scraping workflows.
