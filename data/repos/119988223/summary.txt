git-chglog is a command-line tool implemented in Go that automatically generates CHANGELOG files from Git repository commit history and tags. Designed for software development teams practicing continuous integration and release management, it parses Git commit messages, tag information, and repository metadata to produce structured changelog documentation in Markdown format. The tool supports multiple commit message conventions (conventional commits, keep-a-changelog), integrates with issue tracking systems like Jira, GitHub, and GitLab, and provides extensive customization through YAML configuration files and Go templates. It addresses the problem of maintaining consistent, automated release documentation by eliminating manual changelog creation, supporting semantic versioning workflows, tag-based filtering, and flexible output formatting. Primary users include DevOps engineers, release managers, and development teams requiring automated documentation generation as part of their CI/CD pipelines and release processes.
