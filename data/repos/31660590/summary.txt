`gods` is a Go library providing a comprehensive set of generic data structures and algorithms. It implements fundamental data structures like sets, lists, stacks, maps, trees (AVL, Red-Black, B-Tree), and queues, along with associated iterator, comparator, and enumerable function interfaces. The library enables efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data, supporting features such as sorting, JSON serialization, and deserialization. This library is intended for Go developers seeking robust and performant data structures for building applications and other software projects, offering no external dependencies.
