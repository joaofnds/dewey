Flipper is a Ruby library providing feature flag management and control for Ruby and Rails applications. It enables developers to enable or disable features based on various criteria, including user actors, groups, percentages, and time. Functionality includes integration with multiple datastores via adapters (e.g., ActiveRecord, Redis, Memcached, MySQL, Postgres, Mongo), and offers a cloud-based service (Flipper Cloud) with features such as multiple environments, user permissions, audit history, and rollbacks. This project is a Ruby library targeting Ruby on Rails developers, intended to facilitate controlled feature releases.
