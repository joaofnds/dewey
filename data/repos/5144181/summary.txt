Flipper is a Ruby feature flag management library designed for web application development, particularly Ruby on Rails applications. It provides programmatic control over feature toggles through conditional logic that enables/disables functionality for specific users, user groups, or percentage-based rollouts. The library supports multiple storage adapters including Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Memcached for persistent flag state management. It offers both code-based configuration and web UI administration, with optional cloud-hosted management for multi-environment deployments, audit trails, and team collaboration. Target users are Ruby/Rails developers and DevOps teams implementing continuous deployment strategies, A/B testing, and gradual feature rollouts in production web applications without requiring code deployments for feature state changes.
