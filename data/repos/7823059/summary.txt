Vimmy is a JavaScript-based Safari extension providing Vim-like keyboard navigation and text editing behaviors within the web browser. It allows users to scroll, navigate tabs, interact with elements, and manipulate the browser history using familiar Vim keybindings such as `hjkl`, `gg`, `f`, and `shift-f`. This abandoned project, designed for Safari, incorporates features including customizable website blacklists for shortcut conflicts and offers high-contrast or chevron-based hint display options. Primarily a browser extension, it is built with JavaScript and targets users familiar with Vim keybindings seeking enhanced web browsing productivity.
