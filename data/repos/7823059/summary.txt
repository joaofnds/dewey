Vimmy is an abandoned Safari browser extension that implements Vim-style keyboard navigation and shortcuts for web browsing. Built in JavaScript using Safari's extension APIs, it provides modal keyboard controls including hjkl scrolling, f/F for link selection with visual hints, tab management (gt/gT, x, t), history navigation (H/L), and page scrolling (ctrl-d/u/f/b). The extension targets web power users and developers who prefer keyboard-driven workflows over mouse interaction for browser navigation. It features configurable domain blacklists via regex patterns, customizable hint styling, and fluid scrolling animations. The project addresses the common need for Vim keybindings in web browsers, allowing users to navigate web pages and manage browser tabs using familiar Vim modal editing paradigms without requiring mouse input.
