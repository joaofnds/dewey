Huginn is a Ruby-based automation platform that enables users to create intelligent agents for monitoring web content and executing automated workflows. Built on Rails with support for MySQL/PostgreSQL backends, it provides a self-hosted alternative to IFTTT/Zapier for developers and system administrators who require data sovereignty. The platform implements a directed graph architecture where agents consume and produce events, supporting web scraping, RSS feed monitoring, social media tracking, webhook processing, and API integrations with services like Twitter, Slack, and email providers. Users can deploy custom JavaScript/CoffeeScript logic, create notification systems, and build complex multi-step automation workflows. Designed for DevOps professionals and developers comfortable with Ruby deployment, Huginn addresses enterprise automation needs where third-party SaaS solutions pose privacy or compliance concerns.
