The Web Almanac repository hosts HTTP Archive's annual "State of the Web" report, serving as a comprehensive data-driven analysis platform for web performance and technology trends. Built primarily with HTML and leveraging BigQuery for large-scale web data processing, it combines HTTP Archive's crawl data with expert analysis to produce detailed chapters covering page content, user experience, publishing, and distribution metrics. The platform targets web developers, performance engineers, and web technology researchers who need authoritative insights into global web trends, browser adoption, performance patterns, and emerging technologies. The repository supports a collaborative workflow for writing, analysis, translation, and development contributions, enabling the web community to collectively analyze and interpret billions of web pages' worth of data into actionable intelligence for the web development industry.
