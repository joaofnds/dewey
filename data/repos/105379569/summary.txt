Actix Web is a high-performance HTTP web framework for Rust developers building web applications and APIs. Built on the Tokio async runtime, it provides comprehensive web server functionality including HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 support, WebSocket connections, request routing with macro-based handlers, middleware integration, and SSL/TLS encryption via OpenSSL or Rustls. The framework targets backend web developers who need enterprise-grade features like content compression (gzip, brotli, zstd), multipart streams, static asset serving, session management, and CORS handling. It integrates with the awc HTTP client and supports database connectivity through Diesel, MongoDB, SQLite, and PostgreSQL adapters, positioning itself as a complete solution for building production web services in Rust's systems programming ecosystem.
