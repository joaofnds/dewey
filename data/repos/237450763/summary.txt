Gnomock is a Go-based integration and end-to-end testing toolkit designed for software developers who need to test applications against real dependencies without writing mocks. It leverages Docker containers to create ephemeral instances of popular services including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, MongoDB, and AWS services via LocalStack. The library provides preset configurations for each supported service, enabling developers to programmatically spin up containerized dependencies, initialize their state with schema or test data, and automatically clean up resources after tests complete. Gnomock targets backend developers working on microservices, distributed systems, and data-intensive applications who require reliable integration testing against actual database and messaging systems rather than mock implementations, streamlining the testing workflow in Go applications and supporting HTTP-based access for non-Go projects.
