Gnomock is a Go library and standalone application designed for integration and end-to-end testing of software systems. It leverages ephemeral Docker containers to provision and manage dependencies like databases (Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) and other services (Kafka, Redis, Elasticsearch, etc.) for testing purposes, eliminating the need for mocks. Key functionalities include preset configurations for various services, automated setup and teardown of test environments, and support for testing code written in Go and other languages via an HTTP API, making it a developer productivity tool focused on simplifying integration testing.
