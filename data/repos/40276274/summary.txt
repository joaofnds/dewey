The `ziglang/zig` repository provides a general-purpose programming language and toolchain designed for creating robust, optimal, and reusable software. It functions as a compiler, facilitating the compilation of Zig source code into optimized machine code and offering a standard library. The project's primary focus is on system programming and development, with features encompassing build system integration through CMake and optional LLVM integration for enhanced code generation capabilities. This is a standalone programming language and compiler project, targeting developers seeking a modern alternative to C and C++ for systems-level tasks and general-purpose software development.
