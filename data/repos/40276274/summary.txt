Zig is a general-purpose systems programming language and compiler toolchain designed for low-level software development, targeting domains like operating systems, embedded systems, game engines, and performance-critical applications. Built with LLVM backend integration and featuring a self-hosted compiler architecture, Zig provides manual memory management, compile-time code execution, and cross-compilation capabilities across multiple architectures. The language emphasizes explicit error handling, no hidden control flow, and C interoperability with features like `@cImport` and `zig translate-c` for seamless integration with existing C/C++ codebases. Targeting systems programmers and performance-oriented developers, Zig solves problems around undefined behavior, hidden allocations, and complex build systems while providing a simpler alternative to C++ with modern language features and robust toolchain integration for maintaining optimal, cross-platform software.
