The `exercism/common-lisp` repository hosts a collection of Common Lisp programming exercises designed for the Exercism platform. It facilitates learning and practicing the Common Lisp language through concept and practice exercises, providing testing and validation mechanisms. The project utilizes Common Lisp with dependencies on QuickLisp and ASDF, incorporating build and testing workflows managed via GitHub Actions. It provides a development environment using SBCL and offers tools for track structure validation and exercise testing. This project acts as a curated set of learning materials and tests tailored for Common Lisp developers.
