**themer** is a TypeScript-based theme generation tool that automates the creation of consistent color schemes across development environments and applications. It takes user-defined color palettes and programmatically generates theme files for popular developer tools including VS Code, Vim, Sublime Text, iTerm, Hyper terminal, Slack, and others, while also producing matching desktop wallpapers. The system provides multiple interfaces: a progressive web app at themer.dev, a command-line interface for dotfiles integration, and a JavaScript API for programmatic usage. Built for software developers and UI/UX designers, it solves the tedious problem of manually creating and maintaining cohesive color schemes across multiple development tools, supporting both built-in color sets and custom template creation for extensibility.
