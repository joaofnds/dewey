OTS is a Go-based command-line tool for secure secret sharing in DevOps and development workflows. It implements end-to-end encryption to generate one-time URLs for sharing sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and configuration secrets with team members or third parties. The tool features automatic secret destruction after viewing or expiry, configurable retention periods, regional data residency options, and pipeline integration for automated workflows. Built as both a CLI utility and web service, it addresses the common security challenge of transmitting credentials and sensitive configuration data without exposing them through insecure channels like email or chat. The solution targets developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who need secure, ephemeral secret distribution capabilities integrated into their deployment and collaboration processes.
