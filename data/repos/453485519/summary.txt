PgCat is a high-performance PostgreSQL connection pooler and proxy written in Rust, designed for database infrastructure management in production environments. Built on Tokio's asynchronous runtime, it serves as a next-generation alternative to PgBouncer, offering advanced features like automatic sharding, load balancing across read replicas, failover handling, and query mirroring. The system supports both transaction and session pooling modes, implements PostgreSQL wire protocol compatibility with MD5/SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication, and provides Prometheus metrics integration. Target users include database administrators, DevOps engineers, and backend developers managing high-throughput PostgreSQL deployments who need sophisticated connection management, horizontal scaling capabilities, and high availability features beyond traditional connection pooling solutions.
