Nativefier is a command-line tool enabling the creation of cross-platform desktop applications from any website. Built with TypeScript and leveraging Electron (Chromium), it generates OS-specific executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Core functionalities include automatic retrieval of application icons and names, alongside custom JavaScript and CSS injection capabilities. This standalone application project targets developers needing to package web content as native-looking desktop applications, utilizing Node.js as a dependency and supporting optional integration with tools like ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick, and Wine for icon conversion and Windows build support.
