Nativefier is a Node.js command-line tool that wraps web applications into cross-platform desktop executables using Electron and Chromium. Built with TypeScript, it targets web developers and end-users who need to convert websites into native-looking desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The tool automatically handles app metadata extraction, icon retrieval, and supports custom JavaScript/CSS injection, Docker deployment, and cross-platform building via Wine. It addresses the workflow inefficiency of managing web applications across multiple browser tabs by creating standalone desktop apps from any URL, eliminating the need for complex Electron boilerplate setup while providing a streamlined desktop experience for web-based services.
