`kelseyhightower/envconfig` is a Go library designed for simplifying configuration management by mapping environment variables to Go struct fields. It enables developers to easily load configuration data from environment variables, supporting various data types, including strings, integers, booleans, slices, maps, and custom types implementing `encoding.TextUnmarshaler` or `Decoder` interfaces. The library provides features like struct tag support for specifying variable names, default values, required fields, and auto-splitting of words for improved usability, as well as custom decoders for advanced type handling, making it a versatile tool for Go projects relying on environment-based configuration. It is a Go library targeted at developers working on Go applications that need to read configurations from environment variables.
