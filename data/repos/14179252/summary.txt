**envconfig** is a Go library designed for application configuration management through environment variable binding. It enables Go developers to automatically populate struct fields from environment variables using reflection and struct tags, supporting complex data types including slices, maps, time.Duration, and custom decoders implementing encoding.TextUnmarshaler or encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler interfaces. The library addresses the common DevOps pattern of twelve-factor app configuration by providing automatic camelCase-to-snake_case conversion, prefix-based variable grouping, default values, required field validation, and custom deserialization logic. Targeted at backend Go developers building cloud-native applications, microservices, and containerized systems, it eliminates boilerplate configuration parsing code while maintaining type safety and supporting embedded structs for hierarchical configuration management.
