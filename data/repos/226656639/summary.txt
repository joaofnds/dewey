This repository provides an official configuration module for the NestJS framework, enabling Node.js server-side application developers to manage environment variables and application settings in a structured, type-safe manner. Built with TypeScript and leveraging the dotenv library for environment variable loading, it addresses the critical need for centralized configuration management in enterprise-grade web applications and microservices. The module integrates seamlessly with NestJS's dependency injection system, allowing backend developers to inject configuration values throughout their application while maintaining separation of concerns between development, staging, and production environments. This solution targets Node.js developers building scalable server-side applications, APIs, and microservices who require robust configuration management capabilities within the NestJS ecosystem.
