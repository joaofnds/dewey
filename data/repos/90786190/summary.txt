This repository serves as a reference implementation demonstrating the integration of TypeScript with Node.js for full-stack web development. It provides a complete working example of a Node.js API server with frontend components, utilizing Express.js for server routing, MongoDB for data persistence, and modern TypeScript tooling including ESLint for code quality. The project targets web developers transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript in Node.js environments, offering practical examples of project structure, build configuration, debugging setup, and deployment workflows to Azure App Service. It addresses the common challenge of establishing proper TypeScript development practices in Node.js applications, providing a battle-tested starter template with comprehensive documentation covering development, testing, and production deployment patterns for enterprise-ready web applications.
