`charmbracelet/bubbletea` is a Go framework designed for building terminal user interfaces (TUIs) based on The Elm Architecture. It provides a functional and stateful approach to creating interactive CLI applications, offering features such as a framerate-based renderer, mouse support, and focus reporting.  Bubble Tea enables developers to create both simple and complex terminal applications, suitable for inline, full-window, or mixed-mode use cases.  This library project utilizes Go as its primary language, and integrates with related libraries like Bubbles, Lip Gloss, and Harmonica to provide common UI components, styling, and animation capabilities within the terminal environment.
