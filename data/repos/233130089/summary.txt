Bubble Tea is a Go framework for building Terminal User Interface (TUI) applications using functional programming principles based on The Elm Architecture. It targets CLI/terminal application developers who need to create interactive command-line tools, system administration utilities, and developer tooling with rich text-based interfaces. The framework implements a Model-View-Update pattern where applications define state models, initialization functions, update handlers for events, and view renderers for terminal output. It includes performance optimizations like framerate-based rendering, mouse support, and focus reporting for both simple inline applications and complex full-window terminal programs. The framework serves developers building modern CLI tools, DevOps utilities, and interactive terminal applications who want stateful, event-driven interfaces beyond basic command-line argument parsing.
