egui is an immediate mode GUI library written in pure Rust that enables cross-platform application development for native desktop and web environments. It targets game developers, Rust application developers, and GUI tool creators who need responsive, portable user interfaces that compile to both native executables and WebAssembly. The library uses a triangulated rendering approach that integrates with various graphics backends including OpenGL, Vulkan, and web canvas, allowing deployment across Windows, macOS, Linux, and browsers. egui solves the problem of creating consistent, performant GUIs in Rust without complex retained-mode state management, offering immediate-mode rendering where UI elements are redrawn each frame based on current application state, making it particularly suitable for real-time applications, development tools, and game interfaces.
