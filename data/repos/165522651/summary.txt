`egui` is a Rust library providing an easy-to-use, immediate mode GUI for both web and native applications, particularly well-suited for game development and interactive applications. It enables the creation of user interfaces with features like widgets (buttons, sliders, text editing), layouts, and image support, operating on the principle of redrawing the entire UI each frame. The library's architecture is designed to be portable, modular, and safe, supporting integrations with various rendering backends through mechanisms such as `eframe` for web and native apps and `egui_glow` for OpenGL rendering. This library project is a user interface library, targeting Rust developers building interactive and graphical applications.
