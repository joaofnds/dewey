`database.build` is a web application providing an in-browser Postgres sandbox with AI assistance, allowing users to create and interact with Postgres databases directly within their web browser. It leverages PGlite, a WebAssembly (WASM) implementation of Postgres, to enable in-browser database instances, persisting data with IndexedDB. Core functionalities include CSV import with on-the-fly table generation, report generation, chart creation, and database diagramming, all enhanced by integration with a large language model (LLM). The project is a monorepo built with TypeScript and Next.js, employing technologies like pg-gateway and WebSockets for proxying connections, with Supabase and OpenAI integration. This standalone web application is designed for developers and potentially data enthusiasts, offering a streamlined way to experiment with and utilize Postgres databases.
