database.build is an in-browser PostgreSQL sandbox platform that leverages PGlite (WebAssembly-compiled Postgres) to run fully functional PostgreSQL databases directly in web browsers without server infrastructure. Built as a TypeScript/Next.js monorepo, it integrates OpenAI's LLM APIs to provide AI-assisted database operations including automated CSV-to-table conversion, query generation, and report creation. The platform uses IndexedDB for persistent storage, pg-gateway for TCP connection proxying via WebSockets, and supports deployment to cloud platforms like Supabase. Targeted at database developers, data analysts, and educators, it solves the friction of setting up PostgreSQL environments for prototyping, learning, and data exploration by eliminating installation requirements while maintaining full SQL compatibility and ACID transaction support.
