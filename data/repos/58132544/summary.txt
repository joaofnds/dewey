It enables functionalities including full-text indexing, exact-phrase and fuzzy matching, numeric and geospatial filtering, vector similarity search, and aggregations. The module supports advanced features such as stemming, phonetic matching, and auto-complete suggestions. This project functions as a database extension, enriching Redis with search-engine features, and targets developers seeking to incorporate search and vector similarity search into Redis-based applications.
