RediSearch is a C-based Redis module that extends Redis with advanced search and indexing capabilities for database and backend developers. It implements compressed inverted indexes to provide full-text search, vector similarity search (KNN), geospatial queries, and secondary indexing on Redis data structures. The engine supports complex boolean queries, BM25 scoring, phonetic matching, auto-complete, aggregations, and multi-language stemming using Snowball. Primarily targeting web developers and data engineers building search-enabled applications, RediSearch transforms Redis from a simple key-value store into a comprehensive search engine and vector database, enabling real-time search functionality without requiring separate search infrastructure like Elasticsearch or Solr.
