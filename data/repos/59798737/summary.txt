Randoma11y is a web accessibility tool built in JavaScript that generates random color combinations meeting WCAG accessibility contrast requirements and collects user voting data to improve algorithmic recommendations. The application targets web developers, UI/UX designers, and accessibility professionals who need to select color palettes that comply with accessibility standards. Users can vote on randomly generated color combinations, creating a crowdsourced dataset that trains machine learning models to better predict aesthetically pleasing accessible color schemes. The tool addresses the common challenge in web development where designers struggle to find visually appealing color combinations that simultaneously meet accessibility contrast ratio requirements for users with visual impairments, combining accessibility compliance validation with user preference data collection.
