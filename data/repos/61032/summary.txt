rails.vim is a comprehensive Vim plugin designed specifically for Ruby on Rails web application development. It provides intelligent navigation through Rails MVC directory structures with context-aware file jumping between models, views, controllers, and tests using commands like `:A` (alternate) and `:R` (related). The plugin offers enhanced Ruby on Rails syntax highlighting, integrated Rails command-line tool execution (`:Rails console`, `:Generate`), automated test running with focused execution capabilities, and code extraction utilities for partials and concerns. It features a customizable projection system for defining navigation patterns and integrates with other Vim plugins like dispatch.vim for asynchronous execution and dadbod.vim for database access. Target users are Ruby on Rails developers seeking enhanced productivity within the Vim editor environment for full-stack web development workflows.
