The `dwmkerr/hacker-laws` repository provides a curated, HTML-formatted reference for laws, theories, principles, and patterns relevant to software developers and technologists. It functions as an educational resource, compiling definitions and related examples, including laws such as Amdahl's Law, Conway's Law, and the SOLID principles. The project's content is organized as a compendium, offering downloadable PDF eBook versions and supporting materials like a podcast episode. The repository's HTML structure supports static site generation and is designed to be browsable online via its dedicated website, targeting software engineers and technical professionals seeking a comprehensive understanding of core computing principles.
