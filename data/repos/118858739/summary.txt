This repository serves as a comprehensive reference collection of software engineering laws, principles, and patterns specifically curated for developers and technologists. Built as an HTML-based documentation site, it catalogs fundamental computer science concepts including Conway's Law, Brooks' Law, CAP Theorem, SOLID principles, Moore's Law, and Amdahl's Law, among dozens of others. The project addresses the knowledge gap in understanding foundational software development principles that govern system design, team dynamics, performance optimization, and architectural decision-making. Targeting software engineers, system architects, engineering managers, and computer science students, it provides practical insights into development patterns, distributed systems fallacies, optimization principles, and organizational behavior in technology teams. The resource is available as both a web interface and PDF eBook for offline reference.
