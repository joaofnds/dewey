CloudQuery is a cloud governance platform built in Go that functions as an ELT/ETL framework for extracting configuration and security data from cloud infrastructure providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and other APIs, then loading it into SQL databases for analysis. The platform uses Apache Arrow and gRPC for high-performance data streaming, with a plugin-based architecture supporting source and destination connectors written in multiple languages. It primarily serves DevOps engineers, security teams, and cloud architects for Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM), cloud asset inventory management, attack surface monitoring, and FinOps use cases. The system enables SQL-based querying of cloud resources across multi-cloud environments, eliminating data silos between infrastructure, security, and compliance teams through standardized data collection and normalization.
