dockerc is a container compilation tool written in Zig that transforms OCI/Docker container images into standalone executable binaries, eliminating runtime dependencies on Docker daemon or container runtimes. Targeted at DevOps engineers and software distributors, it addresses application distribution complexity by enabling rootless container execution through native binaries. The tool leverages Skopeo for image handling, supports x86_64 and ARM64 architectures, and implements core Docker run functionality including environment variables and volume mounting. It uses a patched Zig compiler for cross-compilation capabilities and integrates with existing container ecosystems while producing portable executables that can run without containerization infrastructure, simplifying deployment workflows for containerized applications.
