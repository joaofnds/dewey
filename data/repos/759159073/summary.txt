`dockerc` is a command-line tool that compiles Docker container images into standalone, executable binaries. Written in Zig, it enables users to execute containerized applications without the need for a Docker runtime or dependency management systems, simplifying deployment. Key features include support for rootless containers, x86_64 and arm64 architectures, argument and environment variable passing, and volume mounting, with support for image loading via Skopeo. This project is a developer productivity tool, offering a streamlined method for distributing and running containerized applications as portable executables.
