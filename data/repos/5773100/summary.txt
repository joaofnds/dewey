The Great Suspender is a Chrome extension, implemented in JavaScript, designed to conserve system resources by automatically suspending inactive browser tabs. Its core functionality involves freeing memory and CPU usage associated with idle tabs, which helps prevent Chrome crashes and improve system performance. The extension supports user-configurable settings via Windows Group Policies, including whitelisting URLs, and integrates with an external API to allow suspension requests from other extensions. As a browser extension, it targets Chrome users experiencing high resource consumption.
