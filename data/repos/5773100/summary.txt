The Great Suspender is a Chrome browser extension built in JavaScript that automatically suspends inactive tabs to reduce memory consumption and prevent browser crashes. Targeting web browser users experiencing resource constraints, it implements tab lifecycle management through Chrome's extension APIs, automatically suspending tabs after configurable time periods while preserving tab state through screenshots via html2canvas library and persistent storage using IndexedDB with db.js wrapper. The extension addresses Chrome's notorious memory usage issues by providing automated tab suspension, whitelist management, and recovery mechanisms. It supports enterprise deployment through Windows Group Policies and offers external API integration for other Chrome extensions, serving end-users seeking browser performance optimization.
