Alpine.js is a lightweight JavaScript framework for web development that enables developers to add reactive behavior and interactivity directly within HTML markup using declarative attributes. Targeting frontend web developers, it serves as a minimal alternative to larger frameworks like Vue.js or React for projects requiring simple DOM manipulation, state management, and event handling without complex build processes. The monorepo architecture includes the core Alpine.js library plus modular plugins for specific functionality like form input masking, element intersection detection, state persistence, and DOM morphing. Built with ESBuild and distributed as both CDN-ready scripts and ES/CommonJS modules, Alpine.js addresses the need for lightweight client-side interactivity in server-rendered applications, progressive enhancement scenarios, and projects where full SPA frameworks would be overkill.
