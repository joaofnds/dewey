dropbar.nvim is a Neovim plugin that provides IDE-style breadcrumb navigation through winbar integration, targeting software developers working in code editors. Built in Lua, it leverages Neovim's LSP framework, TreeSitter parsers, and native UI components to display hierarchical code context (functions, classes, modules) in a breadcrumb bar above editor windows. The plugin solves code navigation challenges by offering clickable breadcrumbs with dropdown menus, fuzzy search capabilities, and multiple backend sources (LSP, TreeSitter, markdown, file paths) for symbol extraction. It supports mouse interactions, keyboard shortcuts, and automatic truncation for long symbol paths. The tool serves developers across various programming languages who need efficient code structure navigation and context awareness while editing files in Neovim.
