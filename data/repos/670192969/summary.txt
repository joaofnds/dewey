`pgmq/pgmq` is a PLpgSQL-based extension providing a lightweight message queue functionality, similar to AWS SQS and RSMQ, built entirely within a PostgreSQL database. It enables asynchronous communication and task management within a PostgreSQL environment, offering a queuing solution for applications needing reliable message delivery. The project facilitates message storage, retrieval, and potentially management operations via its integration with the PostgreSQL database, operating as a standalone extension. The target audience is likely developers using PostgreSQL who require a message queue for their application backend.
