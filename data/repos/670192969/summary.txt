PGMQ is a PostgreSQL extension that implements a lightweight message queue system directly within the database, providing an alternative to cloud-based solutions like AWS SQS and Redis-based RSMQ. Built entirely in PLpgSQL, it targets backend developers and system architects working on distributed systems, microservices, and asynchronous processing workflows. The extension creates queue tables within PostgreSQL and provides SQL functions for message operations including send, read, delete, and archive with guaranteed exactly-once delivery semantics and configurable visibility timeouts. It supports message persistence, partitioned queues for scalability, and maintains API compatibility with existing message queue services, making it suitable for applications requiring reliable message processing without external dependencies or infrastructure complexity.
