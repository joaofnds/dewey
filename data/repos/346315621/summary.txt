go.nvim is a comprehensive Neovim plugin that provides a complete Go development environment for software developers working with the Go programming language. Built in Lua with asynchronous operations, it integrates core Go development tools including the gopls language server, treesitter for syntax parsing, nvim-dap for debugging with Delve, and nvim-lsp for language server protocol support. The plugin addresses the full Go development workflow by providing code formatting (gofmt/goimports), test execution and coverage analysis, struct tag management, code generation, refactoring tools, and debugging capabilities. It supports modern Go development practices including build tag detection, mock generation with mockgen, unit test framework integration (gotests/ginkgo), and LSP-powered features like goto definition, references, and code actions. Target users are Go developers seeking an integrated IDE-like experience within Neovim for backend development, microservices, and systems programming projects.
