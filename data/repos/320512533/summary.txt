This repository implements a trie (prefix tree) data structure in Emacs Lisp, providing efficient storage and retrieval operations for string-based datasets within the Emacs ecosystem. The implementation serves software developers working with text processing, autocomplete functionality, dictionary lookups, and prefix-based search operations in Emacs packages and configurations. As part of the Emacsmirror collection, it targets Emacs Lisp developers building text editors, IDE features, or linguistic tools that require fast prefix matching and string traversal capabilities. The trie structure enables O(m) insertion and lookup operations where m is the string length, making it particularly valuable for implementing features like symbol completion, spell checkers, or command suggestion systems within Emacs-based development environments and text manipulation workflows.
