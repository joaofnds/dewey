Aleph.js is a full-stack web development framework built specifically for the Deno runtime environment, targeting modern web developers who want to build React-based applications with TypeScript. The framework provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and REST API capabilities using Deno's native ESM module system and SWC for fast compilation. It integrates with React 18, UnoCSS for styling, and supports deployment to Deno Deploy, addressing the need for a cohesive full-stack solution in the Deno ecosystem. The framework enables developers to build both frontend React applications and backend APIs within a single TypeScript codebase, leveraging Deno's security model and built-in tooling while providing modern web development features like component-based architecture and multiple rendering strategies.
