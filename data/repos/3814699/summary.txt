benchmark-ips is a Ruby performance measurement library that provides iterations-per-second (IPS) benchmarking capabilities for Ruby developers. It enhances Ruby's standard Benchmark library by automatically determining optimal iteration counts and measuring code execution frequency rather than total runtime, making it particularly useful for microbenchmarking and performance optimization tasks. The library targets Ruby developers working on performance-critical applications, offering features like automatic warmup phases, statistical analysis with standard deviation reporting, overhead reduction techniques, and comparative analysis between multiple code implementations. It supports advanced configurations including custom test suites, garbage collection control, and independent benchmarking across separate Ruby processes, making it essential for developers who need precise performance measurements when optimizing algorithms, comparing implementation alternatives, or conducting detailed performance analysis in Ruby applications.
