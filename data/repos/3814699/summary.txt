`benchmark-ips` is a Ruby library providing an enhanced iteration-per-second benchmarking utility. It allows precise measurement of code performance by automatically determining iteration counts for accurate results, particularly for short code snippets, reporting iterations per second (i/s) with standard deviation and offering features to reduce overhead through direct code integration. Functionality includes configuration options for warmup and calculation phases, support for custom suites to disable garbage collection, and the ability to share results online and output to JSON. This library is primarily a developer tool, aimed at Ruby developers focused on performance optimization.
