This repository is a comprehensive web framework benchmarking platform that systematically evaluates and compares the performance of various HTTP web frameworks across multiple programming languages. Built primarily with Ruby tooling, it uses Docker containerization to isolate each framework implementation, wrk for load testing and performance measurement, and PostgreSQL for result storage. The system automates the build, deployment, and benchmarking process for frameworks like PHP/Lumen and others, collecting standardized performance metrics to determine relative speed and throughput capabilities. Targeting web developers, framework maintainers, and software architects in the web development domain, it solves the critical problem of objective framework selection by providing data-driven performance comparisons, helping developers make informed decisions about technology stack choices based on empirical benchmarking data rather than subjective preferences.
