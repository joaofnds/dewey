Freeze is a Go-based command-line tool that generates PNG, SVG, and WebP images from source code files and terminal output for documentation and presentation purposes. Targeting developers, technical writers, and educators in software development domains, it addresses the common need to create visually appealing code screenshots for documentation, tutorials, blogs, and presentations. The tool features syntax highlighting with customizable themes, ANSI terminal output capture via the `--execute` flag, and extensive styling options including fonts, shadows, borders, and window decorations. It includes an interactive TUI mode for configuration and supports automatic language detection. Freeze solves the manual screenshot workflow problem by providing programmatic image generation with consistent formatting, making it particularly valuable for DevOps documentation, educational content creation, and technical communication workflows.
