`freeze` is a Go-based command-line application designed to generate images of code snippets and terminal output. It enables users to capture and visually represent code blocks, including syntax-highlighted code, and the output of terminal commands, creating PNG, SVG, and WebP images. Featuring an interactive TUI for customization, `freeze` supports theming, font customization, window styling, and configuration via JSON files. This is a standalone CLI tool primarily for developers seeking to create visual documentation or share code examples.
