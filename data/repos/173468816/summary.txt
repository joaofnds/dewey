`JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action` is a TypeScript-based GitHub Action designed for automated deployment of project builds to GitHub Pages. It enables continuous deployment (CI/CD) by pushing production-ready code to any specified branch, including `gh-pages` and `docs`, and supports cross-repository deployments and GitHub Enterprise. The action leverages GitHub Actions workflows, utilizing the `actions/checkout` step and configured with a `folder` input specifying the build directory, and can be customized with options for SSH keys, custom commit messages, and branch selection. This project is a developer productivity tool, specifically a GitHub Action, intended for use by developers deploying static websites or project documentation.
