SuperTest is a Node.js testing library that provides a fluent API for testing HTTP servers and REST APIs in web development. Built on top of SuperAgent, it enables developers to write integration tests by making HTTP requests to Express applications, Koa servers, or any Node.js HTTP server without managing ports or server lifecycle. The library offers chainable assertion methods for validating response status codes, headers, body content, and custom validation functions, supporting both callback and Promise/async-await patterns. It integrates seamlessly with testing frameworks like Mocha, Jest, and Jasmine, allowing web developers and QA engineers to perform end-to-end API testing, authentication flows, file uploads, and cookie persistence scenarios. SuperTest abstracts the complexity of HTTP testing while maintaining access to low-level SuperAgent functionality for advanced use cases.
