This repository provides an Emacs Org-mode document for solving alternating current (AC) electrical circuit calculations in both rectangular and polar complex number forms. Targeting electrical engineering education and practice, it enables computation of impedance, current, and voltage parameters across nine classic AC circuit topologies including pure resistive/inductive/capacitive circuits, RL/RC/RLC combinations in both series and parallel configurations. Built entirely on Emacs' native capabilities (Org-mode and Calc), the tool allows engineers and electrical engineering students to input circuit parameters as complex numbers and execute calculations through Org-mode's literate programming features. The solution addresses the common need for systematic AC circuit analysis without requiring specialized electrical engineering software, making it accessible to anyone with standard Emacs installation across Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms.
