`ac-circuits` is an Emacs-based project providing a solution for analyzing and solving basic monophasic Alternating Current (AC) circuits. It allows users to calculate impedance, current, and voltage for various circuit configurations, including series and parallel arrangements of resistors, inductors, and capacitors, supporting both rectangular and polar complex number representations. The core functionality is implemented within an Org-mode file, leveraging built-in Emacs features such as `calc` for computations, and facilitates exporting to HTML for result presentation. This project functions as a developer productivity tool designed for electrical engineering calculations.
