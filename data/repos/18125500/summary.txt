Source Serif is an open-source serif typeface repository designed for digital typography and web development, serving as a complementary font family to Source Sans. Built using AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType) and distributed in multiple formats including OTF, TTF, and variable font formats, it targets web developers, graphic designers, and typographers who need professional serif fonts for cross-platform text rendering. The repository provides font source files, build instructions, and releases for implementing serif typography in web applications, print media, and digital interfaces. It addresses the need for high-quality, open-source serif fonts that maintain readability across various sizes, weights, and language support, particularly in professional publishing and web design workflows.
