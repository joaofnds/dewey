`adobe-fonts/source-serif` is an open-source typeface family designed for typesetting text in various sizes, weights, and languages, intended to complement the Source Sans font. This repository provides the source files and build instructions for the Source Serif typeface, including OTF and TTF font formats and potentially variable fonts. The project leverages the `afdko` toolkit for font development and targets designers and developers focused on typography, offering a resource for integrating the font into various design projects. It is primarily a library for font usage and distribution.
