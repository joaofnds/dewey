Axon is a deep learning framework for Elixir that provides neural network construction and training capabilities built on top of the Nx numerical computing library. Targeting data scientists and machine learning engineers working in the Elixir ecosystem, it offers three core APIs: a functional API with numerical definitions (defn) for layers, activations, and loss functions; a high-level model creation API for building neural network architectures; and a PyTorch Ignite-inspired training API. The framework leverages Nx's compiler backends for JIT/AOT compilation and hardware acceleration, enabling models to be compiled to formats like TensorFlow Lite and ONNX. Axon integrates with Polaris for optimization algorithms and addresses the need for native deep learning capabilities in functional programming environments.
