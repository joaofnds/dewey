Axon is an Elixir library providing a neural network framework powered by Nx. It offers functional APIs for deep learning with modules for activations, initializers, layers, losses, and metrics, built using numerical definitions for flexible backend compatibility. Axon includes a model creation API and a training API inspired by PyTorch Ignite, enabling model construction, initialization, and training loops. The project is a library intended for use by Elixir developers in the domain of deep learning and machine learning, enabling the creation and training of neural networks.
