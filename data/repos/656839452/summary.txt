Pop is a Go-based command-line email client designed for terminal-centric workflows in DevOps and developer productivity domains. It provides both TUI (text-based user interface) and CLI modes for sending emails directly from the terminal, supporting SMTP and Resend API integration for email delivery. The tool addresses the need for scriptable email functionality in automation pipelines, allowing developers and system administrators to send emails with attachments, markdown content, and environment-based configuration. Pop integrates seamlessly with other CLI tools for creating automated email workflows, supporting use cases like programmatic notifications, invoice delivery, and AI-generated email content distribution in development and operations environments.
