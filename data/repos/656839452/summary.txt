`pop` is a Go-based command-line application for sending emails directly from the terminal. It allows users to compose and send emails with attachments, supporting both Resend and SMTP configurations for delivery. The application features a text-based user interface (TUI) and a command-line interface (CLI) with options for specifying recipients, subjects, and email bodies.  `pop` integrates with other command-line tools like `mods` (for AI-powered email body generation), `gum` (for interactive contact selection), and `invoice` (for invoice attachment), demonstrating a focus on developer productivity and command-line workflow enhancement. It is designed to streamline email sending within a terminal environment, targeting developers.
