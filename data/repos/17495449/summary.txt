`ydiff` is a standalone command-line application designed for structural comparison of Lisp family language programs. It parses code to provide language-aware comparisons, insensitive to formatting, and capable of detecting refactored code, generating a human-friendly HTML output. Implemented in Emacs Lisp and built using Racket, the tool supports comparing code files and highlights differences. The project's architecture relies on language-specific parsers and utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the interactive user interface, enabling developers to visually inspect code changes.
