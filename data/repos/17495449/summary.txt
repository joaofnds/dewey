ydiff is a structural diff tool specifically designed for Lisp family languages, implemented in Racket with experimental support for C++ and JavaScript. It performs semantic-aware code comparison by parsing program structure rather than treating code as plain text, enabling detection of refactored, moved, or renamed code blocks while remaining insensitive to formatting changes like whitespace and indentation. The tool generates HTML output with interactive navigation for visualizing differences between code files. Targeted at Lisp developers and programming language researchers, ydiff addresses the limitation of traditional text-based diff tools that produce noisy results when comparing structurally similar but syntactically different code, particularly useful for code review, version control analysis, and understanding program evolution in functional programming environments.
