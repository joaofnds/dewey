WTFJS is an educational JavaScript reference repository that catalogs counterintuitive behaviors, edge cases, and unexpected quirks in JavaScript's type coercion, operator precedence, and language semantics. Targeting web developers and JavaScript engineers, it serves as a comprehensive handbook documenting tricky examples like array equality comparisons, NaN behavior, implicit type conversions, and prototype chain anomalies. The repository functions as both a learning resource for developers seeking to understand JavaScript's underlying mechanics and a debugging reference for identifying common pitfalls in production code. Available as an NPM package for command-line access, it addresses the critical need for developers to comprehend JavaScript's complex type system, automatic semicolon insertion, and coercion rules that can lead to unexpected runtime behavior in web applications and Node.js environments.
