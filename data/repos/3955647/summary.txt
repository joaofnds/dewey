Lodash is a comprehensive JavaScript utility library that provides modular, performance-optimized helper functions for common programming tasks in web development and Node.js applications. It addresses the limitations and inconsistencies of native JavaScript methods by offering a consistent API for array manipulation, object transformation, string processing, function composition, and data type validation. Available in multiple module formats including UMD, ES modules, functional programming variants, and individual per-method packages, Lodash supports tree-shaking and custom builds for optimal bundle sizes. The library serves JavaScript developers across frontend and backend environments who need reliable, cross-browser compatible utilities for data manipulation, iteration, and functional programming patterns, reducing boilerplate code and improving development productivity in modern JavaScript applications.
