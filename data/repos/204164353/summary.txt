Kestra is a Java-based, event-driven workflow orchestration platform designed for DevOps and data engineering teams to automate complex pipelines and processes. Built as an alternative to Apache Airflow and similar tools, it uses declarative YAML configurations to define workflows that can be triggered by schedules or real-time events. The platform features a comprehensive plugin ecosystem with 600+ integrations for databases, cloud services, and APIs, supporting script execution in multiple languages including Python, Node.js, and Shell. Kestra targets system administrators, data engineers, and DevOps professionals who need to orchestrate data pipelines, automate infrastructure tasks, and manage microservice workflows with built-in fault tolerance, version control integration, and scalable distributed execution across Docker and Kubernetes environments.
