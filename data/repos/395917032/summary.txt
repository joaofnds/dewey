`viddy` is a command-line interface (CLI) application, a modern replacement for the `watch` command, written in Rust. It enables periodic execution of commands with colorized output and diff highlighting, offering features such as a "time machine" mode for navigating command history, text search within output, pager integration, and customizable keybindings. The application supports installation via Cargo, Homebrew, and package managers for various Linux distributions and macOS. `viddy` is targeted at developers and system administrators who need to monitor command outputs in a terminal environment.
