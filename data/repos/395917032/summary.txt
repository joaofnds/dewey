Viddy is a Rust-based terminal utility that modernizes the traditional Unix `watch` command for system administrators and DevOps engineers. It provides enhanced command monitoring capabilities including periodic command execution with diff highlighting, a "time machine" feature for rewinding through command output history, integrated paging functionality, and Vim-like navigation keybindings. The tool operates as a TUI (Terminal User Interface) application that saves execution history, supports text search, customizable color schemes, and configurable keymappings through TOML configuration files. Viddy addresses the limitations of the standard `watch` command by adding temporal navigation, persistent history, and improved user interaction patterns, making it particularly useful for monitoring system processes, log files, and command outputs in terminal-based workflows.
