Pratica is a TypeScript library that implements functional algebraic data types (ADTs) including monads and monoids for JavaScript/TypeScript web development. It provides pragmatic functional programming constructs like Maybe monads for safe null handling, Either types for error management, and other FP utilities that prevent runtime errors through compile-time safety. The library targets JavaScript/TypeScript developers seeking to incorporate functional programming patterns into web applications without the complexity of academic FP libraries. Key features include chainable operations, short-circuit evaluation for null values, and a simplified API that maintains data integrity while being accessible to developers transitioning from imperative to functional programming paradigms in frontend and Node.js environments.
