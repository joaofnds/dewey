`pratica` is a TypeScript library providing functional programming utilities focused on algebraic data types to enhance developer productivity. It offers `Maybe` and `Result` monads for handling nullable data and conditional logic, respectively, along with functions like `parseDate`, `encase`, and safe data retrieval methods (`get`, `head`, `tail`, `tryFind`) to prevent runtime errors. The library also includes functions for safely collecting values from arrays of results or maybes and utilizes algebraic data types for enhanced type safety. This is a developer productivity library, intended for TypeScript developers seeking to incorporate functional programming patterns into their projects.
