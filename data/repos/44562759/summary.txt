`mount` is a Clojure library designed for managing application state, specifically focusing on making state reloadable within a REPL environment for efficient development workflows. Its core functionality revolves around defining and controlling application state components (using `defstate`), managing their lifecycles with start/stop functions, and handling dependencies through Clojure's `require`. Featuring support for ClojureScript and a `cljc` mode,  it offers advanced features like state swapping, selective application startup/shutdown, and automatic state restart on code changes, making it a developer productivity tool. It's targeted towards Clojure and ClojureScript developers building applications that require easy state management and rapid iteration.
