Lustre is a web development framework built in Gleam for creating frontend applications including HTML templates, single-page applications, and real-time server components. It implements an Elm-inspired Model-View-Update (MVU) architecture with managed side effects for state management, targeting web developers building small-to-medium scale applications. The framework provides a declarative functional API for HTML construction without templates or macros, supports server-side rendering, and features universal components that can run across multiple environments (client, server, Web Components). Lustre compiles to JavaScript for browser execution and includes development tooling for hot reloading, addressing the complexity of modern frontend development by providing opinionated, batteries-included solutions for web application architecture and component composition.
