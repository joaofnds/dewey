`test-runner` is a lightweight Clojure library that provides standardized test discovery and execution for projects using native Clojure deps tooling (deps.edn) without heavyweight build tools like Leiningen or Boot. Built for Clojure software development, it integrates with `clojure.test` and Clojure 1.9+'s dependency resolution system to automatically discover and run unit tests and property-based tests. The library supports both `clojure -X` (exec) and `clojure -M` (main) invocation styles, offering flexible test filtering through namespace patterns, directory scanning, metadata-based inclusions/exclusions, and specific test variable targeting. Targeting Clojure developers who prefer minimal, decomplected tooling, it solves the gap between Clojure's built-in testing capabilities and the lack of a standard test runner for deps-based projects.
