evil-embrace.el is an Emacs Lisp package that integrates embrace.el functionality with evil-surround for Vim emulation users in Emacs. It targets developers and technical writers using Emacs with Evil mode (Vim keybindings) who need enhanced text manipulation capabilities. The package addresses evil-surround's limitation in handling custom surrounding pairs that lack predefined text objects, particularly useful for LaTeX markup, Markdown, and other structured text formats. It delegates standard delimiters (parentheses, brackets, quotes) to evil-surround while routing custom pairs through embrace.el's extensible system, enabling consistent add/change/delete operations for any user-defined surrounding pairs. The solution is specifically designed for Emacs power users working with domain-specific markup languages requiring custom text object definitions beyond evil-surround's built-in capabilities.
