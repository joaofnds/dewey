`evil-embrace.el` is an Emacs Lisp package providing integration between the Evil and embrace.el packages. It enhances the functionality of Evil mode by incorporating features from embrace.el, presumably related to text manipulation or editing within Emacs. As an Emacs Lisp plugin, it extends the capabilities of Evil mode, improving the editing experience for users who utilize both packages within the Emacs environment. This project's target audience is Emacs users employing the Evil and embrace.el modes.
