ts.el is a high-performance Emacs Lisp library for timestamp and date-time manipulation within the Emacs ecosystem. Designed for Emacs package developers and power users, it provides a structured alternative to Emacs' native time functions like `format-time-string` through object-oriented accessors, adjustors, and comparators. The library implements lazy evaluation and caching of formatted date parts to optimize performance, avoiding expensive string-to-number conversions. Key features include parsing various timestamp formats (including Org-mode timestamps), duration calculations, human-readable formatting, and comprehensive date arithmetic operations. It targets Emacs developers building productivity tools, calendar applications, or any time-sensitive functionality, offering a more intuitive API than raw Emacs time primitives while maintaining compatibility with existing Emacs time representations and Unix timestamps.
