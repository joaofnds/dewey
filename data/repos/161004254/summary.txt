This Emacs Lisp library, named ts.el, is a specialized date and time solution for the Emacs environment. It aims to simplify date manipulation by providing easy-to-use accessors like `(ts-year (ts-now))`, improving upon traditional patterns such as `(string-to-number (format-time-string "%Y"))`. To enhance performance, formatted date parts are computed lazily and cached for later access, reducing the number of expensive `(string-to-number (format-time-string...`)` calls. The library offers various functionalities including accessors, adjustors, comparators, duration calculations, formatting, parsing, and miscellaneous utilities. This library is a valuable addition for Emacs users dealing with date and time manipulations in their workflows.
