This repository provides educational materials and sample code for learning Datomic, a distributed database system that treats data as immutable facts. Built in Clojure, it contains interactive tutorials covering core Datomic concepts including datalog queries, data provenance, transaction functions, and graph traversal. The samples demonstrate practical implementations of database operations, schema design, and temporal data modeling using Datomic's functional programming approach. Targeted at Clojure developers and database engineers interested in immutable data architectures, the tutorials address learning curve challenges when adopting Datomic's unique paradigm of separating reads, writes, and storage. The codebase serves as hands-on training material for understanding how to leverage Datomic's time-aware, append-only database model in real applications requiring audit trails, historical queries, and consistent distributed data access.
