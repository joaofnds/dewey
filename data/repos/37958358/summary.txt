Tesseract.js is a JavaScript library that provides Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities for web browsers and Node.js environments, targeting web developers building text extraction applications. It wraps the Tesseract OCR engine through WebAssembly to enable client-side text recognition from images in over 100 languages without server dependencies. The library supports both browser environments (via CDN, webpack, or ES modules) and server-side Node.js applications, utilizing WebAssembly for performance and deep learning models for text recognition. It solves the problem of extracting machine-readable text from images, documents, and real-time video streams directly in JavaScript applications, making OCR accessible to frontend and full-stack developers without requiring specialized OCR infrastructure or APIs.
