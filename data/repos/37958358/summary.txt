Tesseract.js is a JavaScript library providing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality directly within web browsers and Node.js environments. It leverages a WebAssembly port of the Tesseract OCR engine to extract text from images in over 100 languages. Key features include image recognition within the browser using CDN or webpack, and server-side processing via Node.js, with real-time video recognition capabilities also demonstrated. This library functions as an OCR solution, targeting developers seeking to integrate text extraction directly into their JavaScript applications, primarily for frontend and Node.js development.
