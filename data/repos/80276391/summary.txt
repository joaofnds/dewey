eDEX-UI is a cross-platform terminal emulator built with Electron and Node.js that provides a science fiction-themed interface for system administration and development tasks. The application combines a fully-featured terminal with real-time system monitoring (CPU, RAM, network), touchscreen support, and customizable themes inspired by TRON Legacy aesthetics. Built in JavaScript, it targets developers, system administrators, and Linux enthusiasts who want a visually distinctive alternative to traditional terminal applications while maintaining full functionality for command-line workflows. The software supports curses applications, features directory navigation that follows terminal CWD, and includes advanced customization options through CSS theming, making it suitable for both practical development work and demonstration purposes in the "unixporn" community.
