Bento is a high-performance, resilient stream processor written in Go, designed for connecting various sources and sinks in diverse brokering patterns while performing hydration, enrichments, transformations, and filters on payloads. It offers a powerful mapping language, easy deployment, monitoring, and cloud-native capabilities through static binaries, Docker images, or serverless functions. Bento's declarative approach allows users to define stream pipelines in a single config file, supporting sources like AWS, Azure, GCP, Kafka, NATS, MQTT, AMQP, Redis, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, HDFS, HTTP, MongoDB, SQL, and more. It guarantees at-least-once delivery with an in-process transaction model, ensuring reliability even during crashes or unexpected server faults. This repository is a fork of the original project before the license was changed.
