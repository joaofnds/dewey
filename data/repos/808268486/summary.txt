Bento is a high-performance stream processing framework written in Go that enables real-time data pipeline orchestration across diverse sources and sinks including Kafka, AWS services (S3, Kinesis, SQS), GCP Pub/Sub, Redis, databases, and messaging systems. It targets DevOps engineers and data engineers building cloud-native data infrastructure, providing declarative YAML-based configuration for connecting inputs, applying transformations through its Bloblang mapping language, and routing to outputs with at-least-once delivery guarantees. The system offers extensive monitoring via Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, and health check endpoints, while supporting deployment as static binaries, Docker containers, or serverless functions. Bento addresses the operational complexity of building resilient, scalable data pipelines by abstracting connection management and providing a unified interface for heterogeneous data systems.
