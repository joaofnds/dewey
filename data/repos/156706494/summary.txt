Pampy is a Python library that implements pattern matching functionality for Python 2 and 3, addressing the language's lack of native pattern matching constructs found in functional programming languages like Haskell or Scala. The 150-line library enables developers to write more declarative code by matching against various data structures including primitives, tuples, lists, dictionaries, class hierarchies, Python 3.7 dataclasses, and typing annotations. It supports advanced pattern matching features like HEAD/TAIL destructuring for sequences, nested structure matching, wildcard operators, and REST parameters. Targeted at Python developers working in functional programming paradigms or those seeking cleaner conditional logic, Pampy transforms complex if-elif chains into readable pattern-based expressions, particularly useful for implementing parsers, state machines, data transformations, and recursive algorithms like the demonstrated Fibonacci sequence and Lisp interpreter examples.
