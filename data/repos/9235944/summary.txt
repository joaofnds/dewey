vim-smooth-scroll is a VimL plugin that enhances the text editor's scrolling behavior by implementing animated transitions for vertical navigation commands. Built specifically for the Vim/Neovim ecosystem, it addresses the jarring user experience of standard page scrolling operations (Ctrl-f, Ctrl-b, Ctrl-u, Ctrl-d) by providing configurable smooth animation effects. The plugin exposes two core functions, `smooth_scroll#up` and `smooth_scroll#down`, with parameters for controlling scroll distance, frame duration in milliseconds, and animation speed (lines per frame). Target users are software developers, system administrators, and technical writers who spend significant time in Vim-based text editors and want improved visual continuity during code navigation and document editing workflows.
