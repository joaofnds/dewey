`vim-smooth-scroll` is a Vim plugin designed to enhance the user experience by implementing smooth scrolling animations. It addresses the jarring visual effect of standard Vim scrolling, particularly when using commands like `Ctrl-f` and `Ctrl-b`. The plugin provides functions `smooth_scroll#up` and `smooth_scroll#down`, allowing users to customize scrolling behavior through parameters for distance, duration (in milliseconds), and speed. Written in VimL, it integrates with existing Vim configurations via common package managers such as Pathogen, Vundle, and Neobundle. The primary function of the plugin is to improve developer productivity and visual comfort within the Vim text editor environment.
