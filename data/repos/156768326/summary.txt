Watermill is a Go library for building event-driven applications through message streaming and publish-subscribe patterns. Targeting backend developers and distributed systems architects, it provides a unified interface for implementing event sourcing, CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), sagas, and stream processing architectures. The library abstracts multiple message brokers including Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, Redis Streams, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, and SQL databases through a common Publisher/Subscriber interface. It addresses the complexity of building resilient, scalable microservices by offering middleware support, routing capabilities, and standardized message handling patterns. Watermill enables developers to implement reactive systems and real-time data processing without deep knowledge of underlying messaging infrastructure, making event-driven architecture accessible for Go applications requiring asynchronous communication, webhook processing, database synchronization, and distributed transaction management.
