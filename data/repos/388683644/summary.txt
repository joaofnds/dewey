Explorer is a data science library for Elixir that provides Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrame (two-dimensional) data structures for fast data exploration and manipulation. Built with Rust NIF bindings to the Polars library backend, it targets data scientists and Elixir developers working with structured data analysis. The library supports multiple data formats (CSV, Parquet, NDJSON, Arrow IPC), integrates with external databases via ADBC, and offers a constrained API inspired by R's dplyr and Tidy Data principles. It solves the problem of efficient data processing in the Elixir ecosystem by providing high-performance dataframe operations while maintaining Elixir's functional programming paradigms and immutability, bridging the gap between Elixir's concurrency model and modern data science workflows.
