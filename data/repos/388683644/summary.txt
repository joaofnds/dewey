This Elixir repository, named `elixir-explorer/explorer`, offers a fast and elegant data exploration solution for one-dimensional series (dataframes in two dimensions) within the Elixir programming language. The library is designed for data science tasks, focusing on dataframes manipulation, with support for CSV, Parquet, NDJSON, and Arrow IPC formats. It integrates with external databases via ADBC and file storages such as S3, providing a uniform API whether working in-memory or remotely. The library's backend is based on NIF bindings to the blazing-fast Polars library, offering efficient data manipulation. The API is heavily influenced by Tidy Data principles and dplyr design, aiming for simplicity, efficiency, and Elixir-like programming experience. Users can expect a constrained yet powerful API that encourages elegant data manipulation while maintaining speed and performance.
