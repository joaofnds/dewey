LiveKit is an open-source WebRTC-based Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) media server written in Go, designed for building real-time video, audio, and data communication applications. Built on the Pion WebRTC implementation, it provides scalable multi-user conferencing infrastructure for web and mobile developers. The platform offers advanced WebRTC features including simulcast, selective subscription, speaker detection, end-to-end encryption, and SVC codec support (VP9, AV1). It targets software developers building video conferencing, live streaming, and real-time collaboration applications, providing comprehensive client SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, Flutter, React Native, Unity, and other platforms. The solution includes distributed deployment capabilities, JWT authentication, webhook integration, and complementary services for ingress/egress processing, addressing the complexity of implementing production-ready WebRTC infrastructure.
