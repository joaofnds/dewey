`kubethanos` is a standalone command-line application written in Go designed to introduce chaos engineering to Kubernetes clusters. Its core functionality is to randomly terminate a specified percentage of pods, enabling users to test the resilience of their deployments. The application accepts various parameters, including namespace restrictions, pod name filters, node selections, and an interval for pod termination, leveraging Kubernetes API access. This project serves as a developer tool, allowing system administrators and DevOps engineers to proactively identify and mitigate potential failure points within their Kubernetes environments.
