kubethanos is a chaos engineering tool written in Go that implements controlled failure injection for Kubernetes environments by randomly terminating a configurable ratio (default 50%) of pods across specified namespaces. Designed for DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering teams, it enables systematic resilience testing by simulating production failures in a controlled manner. The tool integrates with the Kubernetes API to select pods based on configurable filters including namespace, node names, and pod name patterns, while providing safety features like dry-run mode and exclusion lists. It supports both in-cluster and external cluster deployment modes, offers health check endpoints for monitoring integration, and includes interval-based execution scheduling. The primary use case is validating system fault tolerance, disaster recovery procedures, and identifying single points of failure in distributed Kubernetes applications before they manifest in production environments.
