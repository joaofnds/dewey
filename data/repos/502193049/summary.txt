Gum is a command-line utility toolkit written in Go that enhances shell scripting and terminal automation by providing interactive components for bash and shell environments. Built on the Charm ecosystem (Bubbles and Lip Gloss frameworks), it offers pre-built terminal UI primitives including input prompts, selection menus, confirmation dialogs, file pickers, spinners, tables, and text formatting utilities. The tool targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, and shell script developers who need to create sophisticated interactive command-line interfaces without writing Go code. Gum addresses the complexity of building user-friendly shell scripts by providing ready-to-use components that can be easily integrated into existing bash workflows, dotfiles, and automation scripts. Each component outputs to stdout, enabling seamless integration with traditional Unix piping and variable assignment patterns in shell scripting environments.
