`tinykeys` is a lightweight TypeScript library for web developers implementing keyboard shortcuts and hotkey functionality in browser applications. The 650-byte library provides a modern API for binding complex key combinations including modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Meta), sequential key presses, and regex pattern matching against DOM KeyboardEvent properties. It handles cross-platform keyboard differences between Windows and macOS, supports both ES modules and CDN distribution, and integrates seamlessly with React hooks and other frontend frameworks. The library solves the common web development problem of implementing robust keyboard navigation and shortcuts without bloating bundle size, targeting frontend developers building interactive web applications requiring keyboard-driven user interfaces and accessibility features.
