**yazi.nvim** is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that integrates the yazi terminal file manager directly into the Neovim editor environment. Designed for software developers and power users who work extensively within Neovim, it addresses the need for efficient file navigation and management without leaving the editor context. The plugin opens yazi in floating windows, synchronizes file operations (rename, move, delete) with Neovim buffers and LSP servers, and provides seamless integration with popular Neovim ecosystem tools like telescope.nvim, fzf-lua, and snacks.nvim. Key features include multi-file selection with quickfix list support, visual file highlighting, customizable keybindings, and automated buffer synchronization. It targets the developer tooling domain, specifically enhancing the Neovim-based development workflow by bridging terminal-based file management with editor functionality, eliminating context switching for developers who prefer terminal-centric environments.
