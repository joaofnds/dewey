JJ is a command-line JSON stream editor written in Go that provides fast reading and updating of JSON documents through path-based queries. Built on GJSON and SJSON libraries, it enables developers and system administrators to extract, modify, and delete JSON values without parsing entire documents, optimizing performance by skipping irrelevant sections. The tool supports JSON Lines format, raw value handling, array manipulation, nested object updates, and pretty-printing capabilities. Targeting DevOps workflows, API development, and data processing pipelines, JJ serves as a lightweight alternative to complex JSON parsing tools for shell scripting, configuration management, and automated data transformation tasks where efficient JSON manipulation is required without the overhead of full parsing libraries.
