Nuxt is a full-stack web application framework built on top of Vue.js for creating production-ready web applications and websites. Written in TypeScript, it targets web developers building modern JavaScript applications with multiple rendering strategies including server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), client-side rendering (CSR), and hybrid rendering approaches. The framework provides automated routing with code-splitting, built-in SEO optimization, data fetching utilities, and seamless TypeScript integration with zero configuration. It addresses the complexity of configuring Vue.js applications for production by offering convention-over-configuration architecture, automatic component imports, and extensibility through 200+ modules, enabling developers to build scalable, SEO-friendly web applications with minimal setup overhead.
