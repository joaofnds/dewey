`@japa/core` is a TypeScript-based testing framework library that provides fundamental primitives and building blocks for constructing custom test runners in the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem. Targeting web developers and JavaScript engineers, it serves as the foundational layer for the Japa testing framework, offering core abstractions for test execution, assertion handling, and test lifecycle management. The library enables developers to build specialized test runners similar to `@japa/runner` by providing low-level APIs for test discovery, execution orchestration, and result reporting. It addresses the need for flexible, extensible testing infrastructure in modern JavaScript applications, particularly for developers who require custom testing workflows beyond standard testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
