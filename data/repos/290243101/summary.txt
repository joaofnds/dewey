Hurl is a Rust-based command-line HTTP client and API testing tool that executes HTTP requests defined in plain text format. Targeting web developers, DevOps engineers, and QA testers, it serves as both a data fetching utility and comprehensive HTTP testing framework for REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and HTML APIs. Built on libcurl for reliable HTTP transport, Hurl enables request chaining, response validation through XPath/JSONPath queries, performance testing, and CI/CD integration with multiple report formats (JUnit, TAP, HTML). The tool addresses the need for scriptable, version-controllable API testing workflows by combining curl's networking capabilities with a human-readable DSL for assertions, captures, and test automation in web application development and API integration testing pipelines.
