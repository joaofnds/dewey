Hurl is a command-line tool written in Rust for running and testing HTTP requests defined in a simple plain text format. It supports chaining requests, capturing values, and evaluating queries on headers and body responses, making it suitable for fetching data and testing HTTP sessions. The tool is versatile and can handle HTML content, REST/SOAP/GraphQL APIs, or any other XML/JSON-based APIs. Hurl offers performance testing capabilities, assertion checks on status codes, response headers, and response bytes, and supports various query types such as XPath, JSONPath, and GraphQL. It is well-adapted for REST/JSON APIs, SOAP APIs, and can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines with text, JUnit, TAP, and HTML reports. Hurl's core features include chaining requests, capturing values, query evaluation, performance testing, and assertion checks on various aspects of HTTP responses. It is a tool primarily used for API testing and integration testing in web development projects.
