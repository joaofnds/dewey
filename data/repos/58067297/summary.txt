This repository serves as a companion resource for Emacs tutorials and educational content, primarily written in Emacs Lisp for developers and power users seeking to master the Emacs text editor ecosystem. The repository supports a series of instructional posts and videos hosted at cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs, targeting software developers, system administrators, and technical writers who want to leverage Emacs as their primary development environment. The codebase demonstrates practical Emacs configuration, customization techniques, and workflow optimization through Lisp scripting. It addresses the common problem of Emacs's steep learning curve by providing structured, example-driven guidance for configuring and extending the editor's functionality across various programming languages and development workflows, making it particularly valuable for developers transitioning from other IDEs to Emacs-based development environments.
