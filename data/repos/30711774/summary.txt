The go-playground/validator is a comprehensive Go validation library designed for struct and field validation in web development and API applications. It implements tag-based validation rules for Go structs, supporting cross-field validation, nested struct validation, and deep diving into slices, arrays, and maps. The library integrates with popular Go web frameworks like Gin and provides advanced features including custom validators, internationalized error messages, SQL driver Valuer support, and alias validation tags. It solves the critical problem of input validation and data integrity in Go applications by offering a declarative approach through struct tags rather than imperative validation code. The library targets Go developers building web APIs, microservices, and data processing applications who need robust validation capabilities with minimal boilerplate code, particularly those working with JSON APIs and form data validation.
