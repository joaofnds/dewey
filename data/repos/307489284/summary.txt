Remix is a full-stack web framework built in TypeScript that enables developers to create server-rendered React applications with enhanced performance and user experience. Targeting web developers in the frontend/fullstack domain, it leverages web fundamentals like HTTP caching, progressive enhancement, and nested routing to deliver fast, resilient web applications. The framework supports deployment to Node.js servers and edge environments like Cloudflare Workers, addressing the problem of building modern web applications that maintain performance across varying network conditions. Remix has transitioned development focus to React Router v7, with this repository now in maintenance mode for critical security issues and upgrade-blocking bugs only.
