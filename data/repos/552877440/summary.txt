Hyperswitch is an open-source payments orchestration platform written in Rust that provides a unified API for integrating multiple payment processors and managing complex payment workflows. Built for the fintech domain, it targets businesses and developers who need to handle payment processing at scale with features like intelligent routing, fallback mechanisms, fraud detection integration, and multi-PSP support. The platform uses a modern tech stack including Rust for the backend API server, PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for caching, and provides RESTful APIs with SDKs for web, Android, and iOS integration. It solves payment fragmentation by abstracting away the complexity of managing multiple payment gateways, supporting various payment methods (cards, wallets, BNPL, bank transfers), and offering enterprise-grade features like retry logic, 3DS authentication, chargeback handling, and comprehensive analytics through its Control Center dashboard.
