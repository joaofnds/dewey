Fx is a dependency injection framework for Go applications that eliminates global state and promotes modular, testable code architecture. Developed by Uber for enterprise Go services, it provides a declarative system for managing application dependencies, component lifecycles, and service initialization without relying on global variables or init() functions. The framework targets backend Go developers building microservices, web APIs, and distributed systems who need to structure complex applications with multiple interdependent components. Fx enables constructor-based dependency injection, automatic dependency resolution, and graceful application startup/shutdown sequences. It's particularly suited for teams developing large-scale Go services that require loose coupling between components, testability, and code reusability across different services within an organization's service-oriented architecture.
