Sorbet is a static type checker for Ruby designed to add gradual type safety to existing Ruby codebases. Built with C++ and Bazel for performance, it analyzes Ruby code to detect type errors and provide IDE features like hover information, go-to-definition, and autocompletion through Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration. The tool targets Ruby developers and software engineering teams working on large-scale Ruby applications who want to improve code reliability and maintainability without rewriting existing code. Sorbet uses Ruby's existing syntax with type annotations in comments, enabling incremental adoption across teams. It includes a comprehensive test suite with expectation tests, CLI tests, and LSP tests, and provides both command-line tooling and editor integration for web application development environments.
