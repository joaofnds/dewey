Dozer is a macOS utility application built in Swift that provides system-level menu bar management functionality for desktop productivity optimization. The application integrates with macOS's status bar system to allow users to selectively hide and show menu bar icons through a toggle-based interface, addressing visual clutter in the system UI. It implements native macOS APIs to manipulate menu bar icon visibility states, offering both standard click and option-click interactions for managing two separate groups of hidden applications. The tool targets macOS power users, system administrators, and productivity-focused professionals who need to maintain clean desktop environments while preserving access to background system utilities and third-party applications that populate the menu bar.
