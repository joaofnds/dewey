Maiko is a virtual machine implementation for the Medley Interlisp system, serving as a bytecode interpreter for the historical Lisp programming language variant. Built in C, it targets computer science researchers, language enthusiasts, and developers working with legacy Lisp systems. The VM provides low-level system integration including display rendering through X11 or SDL2, filesystem access, and network connectivity. It supports cross-platform deployment on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, Solaris) and Windows across multiple architectures (x86, x86_64, ARM, SPARC). The project addresses the preservation and modernization of the Interlisp computing environment, enabling execution of historical Lisp applications on contemporary hardware while maintaining compatibility with the original bytecode instruction set and development paradigms.
