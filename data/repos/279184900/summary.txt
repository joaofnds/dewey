`Maiko` implements the Medley Interlisp virtual machine, providing an environment for executing byte-coded Lisp instructions. Written in C, it includes low-level functions for interacting with displays (X11 or SDL), the local filesystem, and network subsystems. The project is a standalone virtual machine application, offering a platform for running and developing within the Medley Interlisp environment. It targets developers and researchers working with Lisp and virtual machine technology, with build support for multiple operating systems (macOS, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, and Windows) and processor architectures.
