Vue CLI is a webpack-based command-line tooling system for Vue.js web application development, designed to streamline project scaffolding, build configuration, and development workflows. Targeting frontend developers in the web development domain, it provides standardized project templates, plugin architecture, and automated build processes for Vue.js applications. The tool integrates webpack module bundling, development servers, testing frameworks, and deployment optimizations through a unified CLI interface. Vue CLI addresses the complexity of modern JavaScript build toolchains by abstracting webpack configuration and providing opinionated defaults for Vue.js projects. Currently in maintenance mode, it has been superseded by create-vue with Vite for new project initialization, though it remains functional for existing Vue.js development workflows requiring webpack-based tooling.
