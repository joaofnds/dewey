The External Secrets Operator is a Kubernetes operator written in Go that synchronizes secrets from external secret management services such as AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and Azure Key Vault, injecting them as Kubernetes Secrets. This operator enables secure access to secrets within Kubernetes clusters by automatically retrieving and updating secret values from various external providers. Key functionalities include integration with multiple secret management systems, automated secret injection, and management of Kubernetes Secrets. This is a standalone application designed for Kubernetes administrators and developers managing sensitive configuration data within a Kubernetes environment.
