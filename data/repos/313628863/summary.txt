External Secrets Operator is a Kubernetes-native operator written in Go that bridges external secret management systems with Kubernetes Secret resources. It operates in the DevOps/cloud infrastructure domain, automatically synchronizing sensitive data from third-party services like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, Google Secrets Manager, and IBM Cloud Secrets Manager into native Kubernetes Secrets. The operator implements the Kubernetes controller pattern to continuously monitor and inject external secrets into clusters, eliminating manual secret management overhead. It targets platform engineers, DevOps teams, and Kubernetes administrators who need to securely manage application secrets across hybrid cloud environments while maintaining GitOps workflows and avoiding hardcoded credentials in container images or configuration files.
