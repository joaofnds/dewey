PureScript is a statically-typed functional programming language compiler that transpiles strongly-typed code to JavaScript, targeting web development and JavaScript ecosystem integration. Written in Haskell, it serves as an alternative JavaScript compiler (alt-js) that brings Haskell-inspired type safety, algebraic data types, and functional programming paradigms to frontend and Node.js development. The compiler addresses JavaScript's dynamic typing limitations by providing compile-time type checking, higher-kinded types, and advanced type system features while maintaining seamless interoperability with existing JavaScript libraries and frameworks. It targets functional programming enthusiasts, web developers seeking type safety, and teams requiring robust compile-time guarantees for complex JavaScript applications without sacrificing performance or ecosystem compatibility.
