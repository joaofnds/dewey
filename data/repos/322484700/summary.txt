Jujutsu (jj) is a Git-compatible version control system implemented in Rust that targets software developers across all domains who need advanced repository management capabilities. It abstracts version control algorithms from storage backends, currently using Git repositories for physical storage while providing enhanced user experience through features like automatic working-copy snapshots, first-class conflict resolution, operation logging with undo functionality, and a revset query language inspired by Mercurial. The system eliminates Git's staging area complexity, treats the working copy as a commit that's automatically amended, and maintains detailed operation logs for debugging and rollback scenarios. It serves developers seeking more intuitive VCS workflows while maintaining compatibility with existing Git-based toolchains and forges.
