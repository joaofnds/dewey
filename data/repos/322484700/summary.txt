Jujutsu (jj) is a Git-compatible version control system (VCS) designed to be both simple and powerful, acting as a developer productivity tool. Built in Rust, it provides a command-line interface (CLI) for managing software projects. Key functionalities include Git compatibility for interoperability, an automatic working-copy-as-a-commit approach, an operation log for undo/redo functionality, and automatic rebase with conflict resolution capabilities. The project is a standalone CLI application that draws inspiration from Git, Mercurial, and Darcs, utilizing Git repositories as a storage layer and offering features like revset language and first-class conflict objects.
