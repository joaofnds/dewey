NPlusOneControl is a Ruby testing library that provides RSpec and Minitest matchers for detecting and preventing N+1 query performance issues in database-driven applications. Designed for Ruby on Rails web developers, it integrates into existing test suites to automatically verify that database queries scale with constant O(1) complexity rather than linear O(N) complexity. The gem works by executing test code multiple times with different scale factors and measuring query count growth, offering matchers like `perform_constant_number_of_queries` and `perform_linear_number_of_queries`. Unlike traditional query counting libraries that require exact query number specifications, NPlusOneControl focuses on performance regression testing by analyzing query scaling patterns, making it particularly valuable for Rails applications using ActiveRecord ORM where N+1 queries commonly occur during eager loading scenarios.
