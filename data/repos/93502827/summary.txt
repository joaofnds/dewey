`n_plus_one_control` is a Ruby library providing RSpec and Minitest matchers designed to prevent the N+1 queries problem in database interactions within Ruby on Rails applications. It enables performance testing by verifying that the number of database queries scales as expected (e.g., O(1) or O(N)) instead of specifying exact query counts, using scale factors for more robust testing. The library integrates with testing frameworks, offering methods like `perform_constant_number_of_queries` and `perform_linear_number_of_queries` to assert query behavior and supports filtering specific queries. This is a developer productivity tool, specifically a testing library for Ruby developers aiming to improve the performance and maintainability of their database-driven applications.
