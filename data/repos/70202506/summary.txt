`golang/dep` was an official experimental dependency management tool for the Go programming language ecosystem, designed to solve package versioning and dependency resolution challenges that existed before Go modules. Built in Go and requiring Go 1.9+, it provided Go developers with capabilities for vendoring dependencies, creating reproducible builds, and managing project dependency graphs through manifest files and lock files. The tool addressed critical problems in Go's toolchain around dependency management, version pinning, and build reproducibility that were prevalent in enterprise Go development workflows. Targeted at Go developers and DevOps engineers working on Go applications, dep served as a package manager that enforced semantic versioning constraints and provided deterministic dependency resolution, though it has since been deprecated in favor of Go modules introduced in Go 1.11.
