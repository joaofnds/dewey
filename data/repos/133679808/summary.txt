RethinkDB is an open-source distributed NoSQL database system implemented in C++ designed specifically for real-time web applications. It stores schemaless JSON documents and provides a unique push-based query model where applications receive continuous updates instead of polling for changes. The database features automatic clustering, failover mechanisms, and horizontal scaling capabilities, targeting web developers building real-time applications like chat systems, collaborative tools, and live dashboards. RethinkDB exposes a JavaScript-like query language through client drivers for multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Go, and Java. The system addresses the complexity of building reactive web applications by eliminating the need for developers to implement custom change detection and notification systems, making it particularly valuable for modern web developers working on real-time, data-driven applications.
