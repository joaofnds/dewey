`actix/actix` is a Rust-based actor framework designed for concurrent and distributed systems development. It implements the actor model, enabling the creation of highly concurrent applications through message-passing semantics. Key functionalities include asynchronous message handling, built-in support for concurrency, and features that promote fault tolerance and scalability in Rust applications. This is a library intended for developers building backend systems and applications requiring efficient concurrency management.
