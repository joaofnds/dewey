Capitaine Cursors is an X11 cursor theme project targeting Linux desktop customization and theming enthusiasts. Built using Python build scripts, SVG source files created in Inkscape, and xcursorgen for compilation, it generates multi-DPI cursor sets (96-576+ DPI) compatible with X Window System environments. The project addresses desktop personalization needs by providing macOS-inspired cursors based on KDE Breeze, designed for GNU/Linux desktop environments and window managers. The build system supports multiple pixel densities and generates both dark and light variants, with distribution through standard Linux package managers and manual installation to ~/.icons directories. Target users include Linux desktop users, system administrators managing desktop environments, and rice/customization enthusiasts seeking cohesive visual themes for KDE, GNOME, and other desktop environments.
