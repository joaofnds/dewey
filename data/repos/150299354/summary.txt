This repository hosts the source code for Tuple's comprehensive pair programming guide, a static educational website targeting software developers and development teams. Built using Jekyll as the static site generator with Tailwind CSS for styling and PostCSS for asset compilation, the site serves as a technical resource covering pair programming methodologies, best practices, and implementation strategies. The content addresses software development workflow challenges by providing guidance on collaborative coding techniques, team pairing adoption, interview processes, and mob programming approaches. Deployed automatically via Netlify with continuous integration, the guide is accessible through multiple domain endpoints and serves as a reference for development teams looking to implement or improve their collaborative programming practices in professional software development environments.
