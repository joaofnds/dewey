Overtone is an open-source toolkit enabling collaborative, programmable music creation and synthesis. It provides a Clojure API to the SuperCollider synthesis engine, offering a musical functions library (scales, chords, rhythms), MIDI device I/O, an OSC client/server, and a concurrent event stream. This project is a library and environment designed for live coding and creating synthesized sounds, supporting features like pre-caching audio assets and integration with external services like freesound.org, primarily targeting musicians and developers interested in algorithmic music composition.
