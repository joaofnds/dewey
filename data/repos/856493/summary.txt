Overtone is a Clojure-based toolkit for live music programming and synthesis that provides a programmatic interface to the SuperCollider audio synthesis engine. Targeting musicians, live-coding performers, and audio developers, it offers real-time sound generation, MIDI device integration, Open Sound Control (OSC) client/server implementation, and a comprehensive library of musical functions including scales, chords, and rhythmic patterns. The framework enables collaborative music creation through its concurrent event streaming system and includes a metronome/timing system for live sequencing. Built on the JVM with Clojure, it integrates with external audio assets via freesound.org API and supports live-coding performances where musicians write and modify code in real-time to generate and manipulate audio, serving the intersection of software development and electronic music composition.
