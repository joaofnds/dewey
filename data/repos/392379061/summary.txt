`cmp-buffer` is a Lua plugin for `nvim-cmp`, providing a source for autocompletion of words present in the active buffer(s). It enables completion suggestions based on words found within the editor's current buffer, configurable via options for keyword matching and buffer selection. Key features include asynchronous indexing of buffer content for performance, locality-based sorting of completion results, and optimization settings such as indexing interval, batch size, and maximum line length to manage performance on large files. It is a library, designed for Neovim users seeking enhanced code completion capabilities.
