`cmp-buffer` is a Lua-based completion source plugin for nvim-cmp, Neovim's autocompletion framework, that provides intelligent word suggestions from buffer content. Targeting software developers and text editor power users, it asynchronously indexes words from current or multiple buffers using configurable regex patterns and offers distance-based sorting through locality bonus comparators. The plugin solves the problem of efficient text completion in large files by implementing optimized indexing with configurable batch processing, interval timing, and memory management for files up to several megabytes. It integrates seamlessly with Neovim's Lua ecosystem and nvim-cmp's completion engine, providing developers with context-aware autocompletion that improves coding productivity by suggesting relevant words based on proximity to cursor position and buffer content analysis.
