Karabiner-Elements is a macOS system utility written in C++ that provides advanced keyboard remapping and customization capabilities at the operating system level. Built using Xcode, CMake, and DriverKit frameworks, it integrates deeply with macOS through kernel extensions and virtual HID device drivers to intercept and modify keyboard input events in real-time. The application targets power users, developers, and system administrators who require sophisticated keyboard workflow customization beyond macOS's native capabilities. It supports both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs across recent macOS versions (Ventura through Sequoia), utilizing code signing for system-level access and Sparkle framework for updates. The tool addresses productivity needs by enabling complex key mapping scenarios, making it essential for users requiring ergonomic keyboard layouts or specialized input configurations.
