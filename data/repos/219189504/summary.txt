BLAWK is a 2D platformer game developed in GameMaker Studio for GitHub's Game Off 2019 competition themed "Leaps and Bounds." Built using Game Maker Language (GML), the game targets the indie game development domain and implements advanced visual effects including window manipulation and display capture functionality through third-party extensions. The project utilizes YellowAfterLife's native mouselock extension for enhanced input control, desktop screenshot capabilities for creating window transparency effects, and window freeze fix utilities for improved performance stability. The game incorporates custom pixel art assets including recolored tilesets and cloud graphics, targeting indie game developers and GameMaker Studio users interested in experimental window-based gameplay mechanics and competition-grade game development techniques.
