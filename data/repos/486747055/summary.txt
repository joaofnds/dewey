This is the official Go SDK implementation for OpenFeature, a vendor-agnostic specification for feature flag management in software development. The SDK provides Go developers with a standardized API to integrate feature flagging capabilities into applications without vendor lock-in, supporting dynamic configuration, A/B testing, and gradual rollouts. It implements core OpenFeature concepts including providers (abstraction layer for flag management systems), hooks (lifecycle event handlers), targeting (contextual flag evaluation), tracking (experimentation telemetry), and domains (multi-provider support). The SDK targets software engineers building Go applications who need feature flag functionality for deployment strategies, experimentation, and runtime configuration management across web services, microservices, and distributed systems.
