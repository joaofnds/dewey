`yay` is a command-line utility, written in Go, designed as an Arch User Repository (AUR) helper. Its primary function is to facilitate the installation, updating, and management of packages from the AUR, providing features such as advanced dependency resolution, PKGBUILD downloading, AUR package completion, and local PKGBUILD building. Users can perform system upgrades, search for packages, and vote on packages directly through `yay`. This standalone application streamlines the Arch Linux package management workflow by integrating with `pacman` and offering a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AUR.
