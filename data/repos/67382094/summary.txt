Yay is an AUR (Arch User Repository) helper written in Go that serves as a package management wrapper for Arch Linux systems. It extends the functionality of pacman by enabling seamless installation and management of AUR packages, which contain user-contributed PKGBUILD scripts for software not available in official repositories. The tool provides advanced dependency resolution, automated PKGBUILD downloading and building, development package tracking, and interactive package selection interfaces. Yay targets Arch Linux system administrators and power users who need to install software from both official repositories and the community-maintained AUR, solving the complexity of manually managing AUR package builds, dependencies, and updates through a unified command-line interface that integrates with the existing pacman ecosystem.
