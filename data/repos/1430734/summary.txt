Bunny is a mature Ruby client library designed for interacting with RabbitMQ, a message broker. It provides a feature-complete implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol, enabling Ruby applications to send and receive messages, supporting various RabbitMQ features. Key functionalities include message publishing, synchronous consumption, queue management, and connection handling. The library leverages the Ruby programming language and targets developers building applications that require asynchronous communication, such as event collectors, web applications integrating with backend services, and systems handling data processing workflows. This is a library intended for integration into other applications.
