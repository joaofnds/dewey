Bunny is a Ruby client library for RabbitMQ that implements the AMQP 0.9.1 messaging protocol, designed for building distributed messaging systems and inter-application communication. It targets Ruby developers working on enterprise applications, microservices architectures, and event-driven systems that require reliable message queuing and routing capabilities. The library enables asynchronous messaging patterns including work queues, publish/subscribe, RPC, and complex multi-stage data processing workflows across heterogeneous technology stacks. Bunny supports modern Ruby versions (3.2-3.4) and TruffleRuby, providing features like message acknowledgments, publisher confirms, TLS 1.3 encryption, and advanced RabbitMQ routing mechanisms. It serves developers building scalable web applications, real-time analytics platforms, CI/CD systems, and distributed processing pipelines that need robust message broker integration without heavyweight dependencies.
