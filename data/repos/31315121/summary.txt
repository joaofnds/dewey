Clap is a comprehensive command-line argument parsing library written in Rust that provides both declarative and procedural APIs for building CLI applications. It targets Rust developers across domains including systems programming, DevOps tooling, and application development who need to create command-line interfaces with features like subcommands, positional arguments, flags, and options. The library handles argument validation, help text generation, error reporting, and complex CLI patterns while leveraging Rust's type system for compile-time safety. Clap solves the common problem of robustly parsing and validating command-line arguments in Rust applications, offering both derive macros for simple cases and builder patterns for complex CLI tools, making it essential infrastructure for Rust-based command-line utilities and developer tools.
