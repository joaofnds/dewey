Eclipse Theia is a TypeScript-based IDE framework that enables developers to build custom cloud and desktop development environments. It provides an extensible architecture for creating multi-language IDEs that run in browsers or as Electron desktop applications, targeting software development teams and IDE vendors who need customizable development tools. The framework implements the Language Server Protocol for enhanced code intelligence and maintains compatibility with VS Code extensions, allowing developers to leverage existing VS Code ecosystem components. Theia addresses the need for flexible, web-based development environments that can be tailored to specific workflows while supporting modern web technologies and providing both browser-based and native desktop deployment options for development tool creators and enterprise teams.
