Bun is a high-performance JavaScript runtime and development toolkit written in Zig that serves as a drop-in replacement for Node.js in web development environments. Built on JavaScriptCore, it provides an all-in-one solution combining a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and npm-compatible package manager into a single executable. The project targets JavaScript and TypeScript developers by addressing performance bottlenecks in traditional Node.js toolchains, offering significantly faster startup times, reduced memory usage, and streamlined development workflows. Bun natively supports modern web technologies including JSX, TypeScript transpilation, hot module replacement, and comprehensive APIs for HTTP servers, WebSockets, database connectivity, and file operations, eliminating the need for multiple separate tools in JavaScript application development.
