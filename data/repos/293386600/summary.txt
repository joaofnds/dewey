This Flutter package provides a customizable multi-handle slider widget that extends the standard Flutter Slider to support multiple simultaneous values within a single control. Built in Dart for Flutter mobile applications, it enables developers to create range selectors, multi-point value pickers, and complex input controls where users need to set multiple ordered values on a continuous or discrete scale. The widget supports continuous and discrete modes with configurable divisions, custom trace patterns for visual styling, and maintains the familiar Flutter Slider API for easy integration. It targets mobile app developers working on data visualization, filtering interfaces, audio/video editing tools, or any application requiring multi-value range selection with an intuitive touch-based interface.
