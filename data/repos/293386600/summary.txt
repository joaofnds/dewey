The `flutter_multi_slider` repository provides a customizable Flutter widget for implementing sliders that accept multiple, ordered values. This library allows for both continuous and discrete slider behaviors, supporting options for custom trace patterns. It leverages the Dart programming language and is designed to be a simple and direct replacement for Flutter's built-in Slider widget, aimed at Flutter developers seeking more complex slider functionality within their applications. This is a Flutter library intended for UI development.
