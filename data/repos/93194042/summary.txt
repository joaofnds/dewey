`hlissner/emacs-solaire-mode` is an Emacs Lisp plugin that enhances the visual distinction between "real" and "unreal" buffers within the Emacs text editor environment, primarily for improved code readability and workflow. It achieves this by remapping and adjusting face attributes, such as background colors, based on buffer context. Core features include buffer-local face remapping via `solaire-mode-remap-alist` and global face swapping using `solaire-mode-swap-alist` when a supported theme is active, providing aesthetic customization options. This plugin integrates with Emacs themes and is designed for Emacs users who want to visually differentiate buffer types through face customization.
