Solaire-mode is an Emacs Lisp aesthetic plugin that provides visual buffer differentiation within the Emacs text editor environment. It distinguishes between "real" buffers (file-visiting code buffers) and "unreal" buffers (terminals, sidebars, logs, popups) by applying different background colors through face remapping using Emacs' `face-remapping-alist` mechanism. The plugin targets software developers and Emacs power users who work extensively within the Emacs ecosystem, particularly those using modern themes like doom-themes, modus-themes, and spacemacs-theme. It integrates with the MELPA package repository and Doom Emacs configuration framework, solving the visual clutter problem in complex Emacs workflows by creating clear visual hierarchy between primary coding buffers and auxiliary interface elements through configurable face swapping and buffer-local styling adjustments.
