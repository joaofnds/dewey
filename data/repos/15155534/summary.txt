GoCD is an open-source continuous delivery server designed for DevOps teams to automate build-test-release cycles and streamline software deployment pipelines. Built primarily in Java and TypeScript, it leverages Spring Framework, SparkJava, and MithrilJS for its core architecture, with Gradle and Webpack for build automation, running on Eclipse Jetty. The platform includes legacy JRuby on Rails components with jQuery for server-side rendering. GoCD addresses the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) domain, enabling development teams and system administrators to implement infrastructure-as-code practices, automate testing workflows, and manage complex deployment pipelines. It serves organizations requiring sophisticated release management, dependency tracking, and parallel execution capabilities for enterprise-scale software delivery processes.
