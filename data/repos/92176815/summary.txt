Jsonista is a high-performance Clojure library for JSON encoding and decoding, specifically designed for web development applications. Built on Jackson-databind with core components implemented in Java for optimal speed, it provides faster JSON processing than existing Clojure libraries like data.json and Cheshire while maintaining essential web development features. The library offers explicit configuration, customizable key transformation functions, streaming support, and tagged JSON for lossless data encoding. Designed for integration with Muuntaja and other web frameworks, it targets Clojure developers building web APIs, microservices, and data-intensive applications requiring efficient JSON serialization/deserialization with minimal performance overhead and maximum configurability.
