The avast/retry-go library provides a robust retry mechanism implementation for Go applications, primarily targeting backend web development and distributed systems engineering. Built with pure Go, it offers configurable retry strategies including exponential backoff, fixed delays, and random jitter for handling transient failures in HTTP requests, API calls, and other network operations. The library features flexible delay functions, unrecoverable error handling, infinite retry capabilities, and both simple function retry (`Do`) and data-returning retry (`DoWithData`) patterns. It solves the common problem of managing temporary failures in microservices, web APIs, and network-dependent applications where resilience is critical. The library targets Go developers building fault-tolerant systems, particularly those working on distributed architectures, web services, and cloud-native applications requiring reliable error recovery mechanisms.
