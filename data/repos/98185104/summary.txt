`retry-go` is a Go library providing a simple mechanism for implementing retry logic in Go applications. It enables developers to easily retry function calls, handling potential errors with configurable options such as backoff delay, fixed delay, and random jitter. The library allows for customization through options including the number of retries, custom delay functions, and hooks for actions on retry attempts. This library is designed to be a developer productivity tool, providing essential functionality for building robust and fault-tolerant Go applications.
