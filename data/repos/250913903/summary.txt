FightPandemics is a full-stack web application built to address pandemic response coordination and local information fragmentation. The platform uses a React frontend with Ant Design components and styled-components, backed by a Fastify/Node.js API server with MongoDB/Mongoose for data persistence and Redis for caching. Authentication is handled through Auth0, with Socket.io enabling real-time communication features. The application is containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS infrastructure using Terraform for infrastructure-as-code. It targets connecting community members, organizations, volunteers, and local leaders by providing a centralized platform for pandemic-related information sharing and resource coordination at both local and global levels, solving the problem of fragmented crisis response communication.
