KeyCastr is an open-source macOS keystroke visualization application built in Objective-C that captures and displays keyboard input and mouse clicks in real-time overlay windows. Targeting content creators, educators, and developers in screencasting and presentation domains, it leverages macOS Input Monitoring APIs and Accessibility frameworks to intercept system-level input events. The application integrates with the Sparkle framework for automatic updates and requires explicit macOS Security & Privacy permissions to access keystroke data. KeyCastr solves the problem of making keyboard shortcuts and typing actions visible during screen recordings, live demonstrations, and collaborative coding sessions, particularly valuable for technical tutorials, software training, and developer presentations where showing exact key combinations enhances viewer comprehension.
