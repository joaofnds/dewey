SMCKit is a Swift library and command-line tool for interfacing with Apple's System Management Controller (SMC) on Intel-based Macs through the private AppleSMC.kext kernel extension driver. Designed for system monitoring and hardware management applications, it enables developers to programmatically read temperature sensors, control fan speeds (RPM), monitor power states, and access other low-level hardware metrics. The library targets macOS system administrators and Swift developers building system monitoring tools, performance dashboards, or hardware diagnostic utilities. Built with Swift 4.0+ and requiring macOS 10.9+, SMCKit solves the problem of accessing private hardware APIs for system health monitoring, making it suitable for development tools but incompatible with Mac App Store distribution due to its use of private kernel interfaces.
