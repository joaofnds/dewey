SMCKit is a Swift library and command-line tool designed to interact with the System Management Controller (SMC) on Intel-based macOS systems. It allows users to read sensor data (e.g., temperatures), control fan speeds, and retrieve system power and misc information by communicating with the AppleSMC.kext kernel extension. The project provides a command-line interface (SMCKitTool) built using the CommandLine library for CLI and ronn for manual page generation. This library targets developers building system utilities and command-line tools for macOS, enabling low-level hardware interaction.
