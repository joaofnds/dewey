Orgit is an Emacs Lisp package that bridges Org-mode document management with Git version control workflows by enabling bidirectional linking between Org documents and Magit buffer states. It defines three specialized link types (orgit, orgit-log, orgit-rev) that capture Git repository paths, revisions, and arguments, allowing developers to reference specific Magit status, log, and revision buffers directly from Org files using org-store-link and org-insert-link commands. The package includes export functionality that transforms these internal links into web URLs for Git hosting platforms (GitHub, GitLab) during document export, with configurable remote repositories and URL patterns. Targeted at software developers and technical writers who use Emacs for both code management (via Magit) and documentation (via Org-mode), Orgit solves the problem of maintaining contextual references between project documentation and specific Git repository states, enhancing traceability in development workflows.
