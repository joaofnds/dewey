Docker-OSX is a containerized virtualization solution that enables running macOS virtual machines within Docker containers using KVM hypervisor technology. Built on Shell scripts and leveraging OSX-KVM, QEMU, and OpenCore bootloader, it provides near-native macOS performance with X11 forwarding for GUI applications. The project targets security researchers, penetration testers, and developers who need macOS environments for iOS/macOS security analysis, CI/CD pipelines, or cross-platform development on Linux hosts. It supports multiple macOS versions (Catalina through Ventura) and includes features like iPhone USB passthrough and iMessage functionality. The solution addresses the challenge of accessing macOS environments for security research and development without requiring dedicated Apple hardware, making it particularly valuable for cybersecurity professionals conducting mobile security assessments and macOS vulnerability research.
