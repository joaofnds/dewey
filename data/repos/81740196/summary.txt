Buttercup Mobile is a React Native password manager application that provides secure credential storage and management for iOS 13+ and Android 13+ devices. Built with TypeScript, React, Redux, and React Native Router Flux, it implements AES 256-bit encryption with 200k+ PBKDF2 iterations for on-device encryption/decryption of password vaults. The application supports cross-platform password vault synchronization, biometric authentication, auto-lock functionality, password generation, and Safari autofill integration on iOS. It utilizes native Objective-C/Java modules for performance-critical cryptographic operations while maintaining a primarily JavaScript codebase. The solution targets end-users requiring secure, cross-platform password management with offline access capabilities and enterprise-grade encryption standards.
