DuckDB is an in-process analytical database management system implemented in C++ designed for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads in data science and analytics domains. It provides a high-performance SQL engine optimized for analytical queries, supporting advanced SQL features including nested correlated subqueries, window functions, and complex data types (arrays, structs, maps). The system targets data scientists, analysts, and developers who need embedded analytical capabilities, offering native integrations with popular data science tools like pandas and dplyr, plus client libraries for Python, R, Java, and WebAssembly. DuckDB solves the problem of performing fast analytical queries on structured data without requiring separate database infrastructure, enabling direct querying of CSV and Parquet files while providing columnar storage optimization for analytical workloads.
