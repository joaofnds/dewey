Ghost Lang is a programming language specification and design project that aims to create a familiar, syntax-light language by synthesizing proven features from existing programming languages. The project targets general-purpose programming with a focus on developer ergonomics, featuring modern language constructs including algebraic data types (structs/enums), pattern matching, string interpolation, and expression-based control flow. Currently existing as a specification without implementation, Ghost combines syntax elements from languages like CoffeeScript, JavaScript, and Rust while eliminating semicolons and emphasizing vertical coding style. The language targets software developers seeking a more approachable alternative to existing systems programming languages, with planned features including static typing, memory safety, and familiar object-oriented and functional programming paradigms for general application development.
