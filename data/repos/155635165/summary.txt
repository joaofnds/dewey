`Ghost-lang` is a nascent programming language designed for ease of use, borrowing syntax and concepts from various existing languages. It outlines features including variable declaration, boolean and string literals, integer and float representation, regular expressions, struct and enum definitions, control flow constructs like `if-else`, `match`, and loops, as well as function definitions, named parameters, and iterable functions. The project aims to provide a "friendly" language, focusing on readability and familiarity for programmers, and currently exists as a language specification with example syntax; tools and a compiler are not yet implemented. The primary focus is language design and its specification rather than an immediately usable tool.
