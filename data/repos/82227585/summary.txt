This repository serves as an educational resource providing ultra-simplified explanations of fundamental software design patterns for developers and computer science students. It systematically covers all three categories of Gang of Four design patterns: Creational (Simple Factory, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton), Structural (Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy), and Behavioral (Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, Visitor, Strategy, State, Template Method). Each pattern is explained through real-world analogies, plain English descriptions, and PHP-7 code examples, making complex object-oriented programming concepts accessible to software engineers across different programming languages. The repository addresses the common problem of design patterns being difficult to understand and remember, targeting developers who need practical guidance on implementing reusable solutions to recurring software architecture problems in their applications.
