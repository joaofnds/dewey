jsonapi-rspec is a Ruby testing library that provides specialized RSpec matchers for validating JSON:API specification compliance in web API responses. Targeting Ruby web developers building REST APIs, it offers comprehensive matchers for testing JSON:API document structure including resource attributes, relationships, links, metadata, and error objects. The library integrates with RSpec testing framework and supports mixed string/symbol key documents, enabling developers to write precise assertions for JSON:API-compliant endpoints. It solves the problem of manually parsing and validating complex JSON:API response structures by providing semantic matchers like `have_jsonapi_attributes`, `have_relationships`, and `have_type`, streamlining API testing workflows for Ruby backend developers working with JSON:API standard implementations.
