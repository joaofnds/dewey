RedisGears/RedisGears is a Redis module written in Rust that provides a dynamic execution framework for running JavaScript (JS) functions directly within the Redis process. This framework enables server-side data processing and event handling, facilitating features like key-space triggers and stream processing, built using the V8 JS engine. Functionality includes registering JS functions, executing them via TFCALL commands, and interacting with Redis commands within those functions. This project is a Redis module, extending Redis's capabilities by allowing custom logic execution within the database server, primarily targeting Redis developers.
