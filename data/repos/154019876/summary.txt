RedisGears is a Redis module that enables serverless JavaScript execution within Redis processes using the V8 engine, targeting data engineers, backend developers, and database administrators working with real-time data processing. Built in Rust, it provides a triggers and functions framework for stream processing, analytics, and MapReduce operations directly on Redis data without external compute resources. The module supports keyspace and stream triggers, synchronous/asynchronous execution, and cluster deployments, allowing developers to implement complex data transformations, real-time analytics, and event-driven processing pipelines. It addresses the need for in-database computation to reduce data movement and latency in high-performance applications requiring immediate data processing capabilities.
