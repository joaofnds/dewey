Spotify TUI is a terminal-based Spotify client implemented in Rust that provides a text user interface for controlling Spotify playback and browsing music libraries. Built for the CLI/terminal application domain, it leverages the Spotify Web API to authenticate users and manage playback controls, playlists, and music discovery directly from the command line. The application uses Rust's ecosystem for TUI development and HTTP API integration, targeting developers, system administrators, and terminal enthusiasts who prefer keyboard-driven workflows over graphical interfaces. It solves the problem of needing a lightweight, keyboard-accessible alternative to Spotify's desktop application, particularly useful for users working in terminal-heavy environments or seeking minimalist music control without leaving their command-line workspace.
