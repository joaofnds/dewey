`spotify-tui` is a terminal-based application, written in Rust, providing a feature-rich Spotify client. Its core functionality involves interacting with the Spotify API to enable users to browse, search, and control their music playback directly from the command line. The application leverages libraries such as `tui-rs` for the terminal user interface and `rspotify` for interfacing with the Spotify API. This standalone CLI application targets users who prefer interacting with Spotify through the terminal.
