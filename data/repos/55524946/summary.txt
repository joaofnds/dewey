`fluxgui` is a Python-based GUI application designed to adjust screen color temperature based on time of day, mitigating eye strain and promoting better sleep, particularly on Linux systems. It functions as an indicator applet utilizing either `xflux` (deprecated) or `redshift` to control display colors, simulating warm light at night. Key features include automatic color adaptation and the ability to configure auto-start on login. The project is a standalone GUI application, heavily dependent on Python and integrates with system tray applets; it targets Linux users seeking to improve their digital well-being.
