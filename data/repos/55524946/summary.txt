fluxgui is a Python-based GUI application that provides a system tray indicator applet for controlling blue light filtering on Linux desktop systems. Built using GTK+ 3 and Python 3, it serves as a graphical frontend for xflux and Redshift backends, automatically adjusting display color temperature based on time of day to reduce eye strain and improve sleep quality. The application targets Linux desktop users and system administrators who need ergonomic display management, utilizing technologies including Python GObject introspection, AppIndicator libraries, and XDG desktop integration. It addresses the health and productivity domain by solving the problem of excessive blue light exposure during evening computer use, functioning as a Linux alternative to proprietary f.lux software with automatic startup capabilities and user-friendly configuration through a persistent system indicator.
