`webi-installers` is a shell script-based repository that provides installation packages for the `webinstall.dev` developer tool, enabling users to install software packages without needing `sudo` or package managers. It leverages a system of release APIs and installer templates to download, unpack, and configure software in the user's home directory, updating the `PATH` environment variable. This project primarily functions as a collection of installer scripts written in POSIX Shell, supporting packages for various operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows, with a focus on simplifying developer tool installations. Its architecture involves `releases.js` files to translate package release APIs, a `_webi/bootstrap.sh` template to configure the installation for different systems, and individual `install.sh` scripts for package-specific customizations.
