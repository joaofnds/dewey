This repository implements a cross-platform package manager system specifically designed for developer tools and utilities, targeting web developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who need to install development software without administrative privileges. Built primarily in Shell scripting with PowerShell support for Windows, the system provides a sudo-free alternative to traditional package managers like Homebrew by installing packages to user-local directories ($HOME/.local/). The architecture consists of JavaScript release fetchers that normalize package APIs from sources like GitHub into a common JSON format, POSIX shell templates for installation logic, and a bootstrap system that detects system architecture to deliver appropriate installers. It solves the common problem of managing development tool installations across Linux, macOS, Windows 10, and WSL environments without requiring system-level permissions or conflicting with existing package managers, making it particularly valuable for containerized development environments and restricted corporate systems.
