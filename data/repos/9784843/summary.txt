bcrypt.js is a pure JavaScript implementation of the bcrypt password hashing algorithm designed for web development and Node.js authentication systems. It provides a zero-dependency alternative to native C++ bcrypt bindings, offering cross-platform compatibility between server-side Node.js applications and browser environments. The library implements adaptive cryptographic hashing with configurable salt rounds for secure password storage, featuring both synchronous and asynchronous APIs with TypeScript support. It addresses the critical security requirement of protecting user credentials against rainbow table and brute-force attacks in web applications. Target users include JavaScript developers, full-stack engineers, and backend developers building authentication systems who need a reliable, portable password hashing solution without native dependencies.
