It functions as a pure JavaScript alternative to the C++ bcrypt binding, compatible with Node.js and browsers. Key functionalities include generating salts, hashing passwords synchronously and asynchronously, and comparing passwords against stored hashes, all designed for secure authentication practices. This is a library for JavaScript developers building applications requiring secure password storage.
