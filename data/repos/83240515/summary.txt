This repository provides Base16 color scheme configurations specifically formatted for the Alacritty terminal emulator, targeting developers and system administrators who use command-line interfaces. Built using Mustache templating, it automatically generates terminal color configurations from the Base16 color specification system, which provides consistent theming across development tools. The repository addresses the problem of terminal customization by offering pre-configured color schemes that can be directly copied into Alacritty's YAML configuration files. It includes standard 16-color variations and 256-color variants for compatibility with Base16 Shell scripts, serving developers in DevOps, systems programming, and general software development who require consistent, aesthetically pleasing terminal environments for their daily workflow.
