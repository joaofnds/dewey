`nginx-proxy` is a standalone application facilitating automated reverse proxy configuration for Docker containers. Utilizing `docker-gen`, it dynamically generates and reloads nginx configurations, enabling seamless routing based on container environment variables. The project, written in Python, leverages nginx for proxying HTTP traffic and integrates with the Docker API for container discovery and service discovery. It provides pre-built Docker images, targeting system administrators and DevOps engineers to streamline the deployment and management of containerized web applications, particularly those using a microservices architecture.
