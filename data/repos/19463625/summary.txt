nginx-proxy is a containerized reverse proxy solution that automatically generates nginx configurations for Docker environments using docker-gen. It monitors Docker container lifecycle events through the Docker socket and dynamically creates nginx virtual host configurations based on environment variables like VIRTUAL_HOST, eliminating manual proxy configuration. The system targets DevOps engineers and system administrators managing multi-container Docker deployments who need automatic load balancing and routing. Built on nginx web server with docker-gen for template generation, it operates by watching container start/stop events and reloading nginx configurations in real-time. The solution addresses the operational complexity of manually configuring reverse proxies in dynamic containerized environments, providing zero-downtime automatic discovery and routing for web applications and microservices architectures.
