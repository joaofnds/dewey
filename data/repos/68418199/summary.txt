Sorcery is a Ruby authentication library designed for Rails web applications, providing a minimalist alternative to more complex authentication solutions like Devise. It supports multiple ORMs including ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Mongoid, and MongoMapper, offering core authentication features through a modular architecture with optional components for HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth integration, remember-me functionality, password reset, user activation, session timeout, brute force protection, and activity logging. The library emphasizes developer control by providing simple methods for login/logout operations, session management, and external provider authentication (Facebook, Twitter) without imposing generated code or rigid MVC structures. However, the project is currently unmaintained and poses security risks, with maintainers recommending migration to actively supported alternatives like Clearance, Rodauth, or Devise for production Rails applications requiring robust user authentication systems.
