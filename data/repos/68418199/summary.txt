Sorcery is an unmaintained Ruby library designed for "magical" authentication within Rails applications. It provides a streamlined approach to user authentication, including core features like login/logout, password encryption, and session management. The library is modular, offering submodules for functionalities like user activation, password reset, remember-me, session timeouts, brute-force protection, HTTP Basic authentication, activity logging, and external authentication via OAuth1/OAuth2. As a Ruby gem, it integrates directly into Rails projects, allowing developers to customize authentication flows within their MVC architecture, targeting Ruby on Rails developers.
