`uni` is a command-line application written in Go for querying the Unicode database. It provides utilities to identify, search, and print Unicode characters, including support for Unicode 15.1 and extensive emoji handling. Key functionalities include character identification (like `hexdump`), search by name or CLDR data, printing character information by category/block, and an `emoji` command with skin tone and gender options. This standalone CLI application is targeted at developers and users who need to inspect or work with Unicode data from the command line.
