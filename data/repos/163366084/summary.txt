`uni` is a command-line Unicode database query tool written in Go that provides comprehensive Unicode character analysis and lookup functionality for developers and system administrators. Supporting Unicode 15.1 with enhanced emoji handling, it offers four core commands: `identify` for character-by-character analysis with UTF-8/HTML encoding details, `search` for Unicode database queries, `print` for character class/block enumeration, and `emoji` for emoji-specific searches. The tool integrates with terminal-based workflows through dmenu/rofi/fzf scripts and Vim plugins, outputting structured data including codepoints, UTF-8 bytes, HTML entities, and character names with customizable formatting options. It addresses the common developer need for Unicode debugging, character encoding analysis, and symbol lookup in text processing, internationalization, and web development contexts where precise character identification is critical.
