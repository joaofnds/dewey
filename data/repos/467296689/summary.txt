Bullet Train is an open-source Ruby on Rails SaaS application template designed to accelerate SaaS product development for web developers. Built on the Rails framework, it provides a pre-configured foundation with integrated authentication, team management, subscription billing, and multi-tenancy capabilities typically required in SaaS applications. The template includes deployment configurations for cloud platforms like Render and Heroku, development environment setup scripts, and Gitpod integration for cloud-based development. It targets Ruby on Rails developers who need to rapidly bootstrap SaaS applications without building common infrastructure components from scratch, eliminating months of foundational development work by providing battle-tested patterns for user management, billing integration, and scalable multi-tenant architecture.
