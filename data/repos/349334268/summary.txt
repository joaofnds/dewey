Ouch is a CLI tool written in Rust that provides unified compression and decompression functionality across multiple archive formats including tar, zip, 7z, gzip, xz, bzip2, lz4, zstd, and others. Targeted at system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who frequently work with compressed files in terminal environments, it eliminates the need to remember format-specific command syntax by automatically detecting file extensions and applying appropriate compression algorithms. The tool supports format chaining, parallel compression for certain formats, and provides streaming capabilities where possible. It serves as a replacement for multiple traditional Unix compression utilities (tar, gzip, unzip, etc.) with a consistent interface, making it particularly valuable for automation scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and daily terminal workflows requiring reliable archive manipulation.
