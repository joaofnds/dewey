Sneakers is a high-performance Ruby background job processing framework built specifically for RabbitMQ message queues, targeting Ruby web developers who need asynchronous task processing capabilities. The framework enables developers to create worker classes that consume messages from RabbitMQ queues, process I/O and CPU-intensive workloads, and handle job acknowledgments with built-in error handling and retry mechanisms. It integrates with Redis for metrics storage, supports Docker containerization, and provides configurable logging and monitoring through metrics providers. Sneakers addresses the common web development problem of offloading time-consuming operations (like email sending, image processing, or API calls) from the main application thread to background workers, ensuring responsive user experiences in Ruby applications while maintaining message durability and processing reliability through RabbitMQ's AMQP protocol.
