SonarLint Core is a Java-based static code analysis library that serves as the foundational engine for SonarLint IDE integrations across Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and Visual Studio Code via language server protocol. Operating in the software development and DevOps domain, it provides real-time code quality analysis and issue detection directly within developer environments. The library implements SonarSource's code analysis algorithms to identify bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells across multiple programming languages, enabling continuous code quality assessment during the development process. Built with Maven and requiring Node.js for certain plugin functionalities, it targets software developers and development teams seeking to integrate automated code quality checks into their IDE workflows, supporting the shift-left approach to code quality management.
