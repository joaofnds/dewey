This repository is a comprehensive educational tutorial for FFmpeg's libav libraries, targeting multimedia developers and video processing engineers. Written primarily in C with examples applicable across multiple programming languages, it teaches the fundamentals of digital video/audio processing, codecs, containers, and media manipulation operations including transcoding, transmuxing, and adaptive streaming. The tutorial progresses from basic media concepts to practical FFmpeg command-line usage, culminating in hands-on libav programming examples for building video players and media processing applications. It addresses the core problem of learning FFmpeg's complex API ecosystem for developers working in video streaming, media conversion, broadcast technology, and multimedia application development, providing practical code samples for common operations like format conversion, audio-video synchronization, and media container manipulation.
