The `leandromoreira/ffmpeg-libav-tutorial` repository provides a tutorial and example code in C for learning to use the FFmpeg library (libav) for multimedia processing. It focuses on core functionalities such as video and audio codec manipulation (encoding, decoding, transcoding), container format handling (remuxing), and common video operations like transrating and transsizing. The project demonstrates libav's architecture, offering examples of basic operations including "hello world" style video analysis, syncing of audio and video, and a basic transcoder converting H.264 to H.265, as well as examples of remuxing and generating fragmented MP4s. This serves as an example project and learning resource for developers interested in media processing and FFmpeg library integration.
