pipes.sh is a terminal screensaver application written in Bash that generates animated ASCII pipe graphics for Unix-like systems. Targeting system administrators, terminal enthusiasts, and command-line users, it leverages ncurses (tput) for terminal manipulation and supports 24-bit colors on compatible terminals. The screensaver renders continuously flowing pipe patterns using various Unicode and ASCII character sets, with configurable pipe types, colors, frame rates, and probability settings. Users can interactively adjust parameters like straightness probability and visual effects during runtime. Built for the DevOps and system administration domain, it serves as both a functional screensaver and terminal eye-candy tool, requiring Bash 4+ and ncurses libraries, with installation support via package managers like Homebrew.
