Jitsi Meet is an open-source WebRTC-based video conferencing platform built in TypeScript that enables scalable real-time communication through web browsers and mobile applications. Targeting the enterprise communication and web development domains, it implements SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) architecture to handle multi-party video calls with HD audio/video, screen sharing, chat, and end-to-end encryption. The platform serves developers and system administrators who need to integrate video conferencing capabilities into web applications or deploy self-hosted communication infrastructure. It provides cross-platform SDKs, Docker containerization, and Debian packages for deployment, solving the problem of implementing secure, browser-based video communication without requiring proprietary solutions or complex WebRTC protocol handling.
