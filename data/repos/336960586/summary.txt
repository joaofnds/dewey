`rune` is an Emacs Lisp project implementing a Rust virtual machine (VM) for use within the Emacs text editor. This extension integrates Rust code execution directly into the Emacs environment, potentially enabling faster or more efficient implementations of Emacs functionalities. The project leverages Emacs Lisp as the primary language and likely aims to extend Emacs' capabilities through the execution of compiled Rust code, offering a new approach for integrating Rust with Emacs. The primary function would likely be to execute rust code from within the emacs environment.
