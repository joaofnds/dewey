PKMDS is a web-based Pokémon save file editor built with Blazor WebAssembly and ASP.NET Core, targeting gaming enthusiasts and Pokémon players. The application leverages PKHeX.Core library to parse, modify, and export Pokémon game save files across multiple generations (from Red/Blue to Scarlet/Violet). Built as a client-side WebAssembly application, it operates entirely in the browser with offline functionality after initial caching. The solution addresses the need for cross-platform save file editing without requiring desktop software installation, supporting formats from handheld consoles, emulators, and modern Nintendo Switch games. Primary users include Pokémon players, speedrunners, and gaming community members who need to modify save data for legitimate gameplay purposes, excluding custom ROM support.
