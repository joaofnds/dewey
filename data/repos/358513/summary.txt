Hiccup is a Clojure library for programmatic HTML generation in web development, providing a domain-specific language that represents HTML elements as vectors and attributes as maps. It targets Clojure web developers building server-side rendered applications, offering automatic string escaping for XSS prevention, CSS-like shortcuts for id/class attributes, and intelligent HTML element rendering that accommodates browser-specific quirks. The library transforms Clojure data structures into valid HTML strings, supporting nested elements, sequence expansion for dynamic content generation, and raw HTML insertion when needed. Hiccup solves the problem of mixing HTML templating with functional programming paradigms, enabling developers to generate HTML programmatically while maintaining code composability and leveraging Clojure's data manipulation capabilities for dynamic web content creation.
