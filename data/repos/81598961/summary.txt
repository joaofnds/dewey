The `python/cpython` repository is the official implementation of the Python programming language. It provides the core interpreter, standard library, and runtime environment for executing Python code. As the foundation of the language, it enables the creation of various software applications, ranging from web development and data science to scripting and system administration. This is a foundational project, serving as the reference implementation and development platform for the Python language itself.
