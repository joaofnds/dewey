CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language interpreter, serving as the canonical Python runtime environment. This repository contains the core C-based interpreter that executes Python bytecode, implements the Python standard library, and provides the foundation for the entire Python ecosystem. It targets software developers across all domains including web development, data science, automation, and system administration. The codebase implements a virtual machine with garbage collection, object system, and extensive standard library modules written in C and Python. CPython solves the fundamental problem of translating high-level Python code into executable instructions while providing cross-platform compatibility across Unix, Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. It serves Python developers, language contributors, and anyone building Python-based applications or extending Python with C extensions.
