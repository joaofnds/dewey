Fluentd is an open-source unified logging layer designed for DevOps and infrastructure teams to collect, process, and route log data across distributed systems. Built in Ruby and operating under the CNCF, it functions as a centralized log collector that aggregates events from diverse data sources (applications, servers, containers) and forwards them to various destinations including databases (RDBMS, NoSQL), cloud platforms (IaaS, SaaS), big data systems (Hadoop), and file storage. The system addresses the critical challenge of log management in microservices and cloud-native architectures by providing a pluggable architecture for data ingestion, transformation, and output routing. Target users include system administrators, site reliability engineers, and DevOps teams who need to implement comprehensive logging infrastructure for monitoring, debugging, and compliance in enterprise environments.
