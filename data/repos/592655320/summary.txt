nvim-dbee is an interactive database client plugin for Neovim that enables developers and database administrators to execute SQL queries directly within their editor environment. Built with a Go backend and Lua frontend architecture, it provides native database connectivity without relying on external CLI tools, supporting multiple database systems through Go's database drivers. The plugin features a custom iterator-based result handling system for efficient query execution and result processing, along with a UI built on nui.nvim for managing database connections, query editing, and result visualization. Targeting developers who prefer terminal-based workflows and database professionals who want integrated query capabilities within their Neovim setup, it addresses the need for seamless database interaction without context switching between editor and separate database client applications. The cross-platform solution leverages CGO for database driver compatibility and includes automated binary distribution for various operating systems and architectures.
