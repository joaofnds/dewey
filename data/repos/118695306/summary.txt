urql is a TypeScript-based GraphQL client library designed for modern web application development, providing framework-agnostic GraphQL query execution and state management across React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, and Solid applications. The library implements a modular "exchange" architecture that enables developers to customize GraphQL request/response handling, caching strategies, and data fetching behaviors. It addresses the complexity of GraphQL client implementation by offering both simple document caching for basic applications and advanced normalized caching through @urql/exchange-graphcache for complex data relationships. The project targets frontend developers building GraphQL-powered web applications who need flexible client-side data management solutions that can scale from simple queries to sophisticated caching requirements in production applications.
