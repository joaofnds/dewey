`badges/shields` is a JavaScript-based web service and associated NPM library for generating concise, consistent, and legible badges in SVG and raster formats, primarily for use in project documentation and web pages. The project's core functionality centers on creating status indicators for various metrics, including build status, code coverage, version numbers, and package downloads, supporting integration with numerous CI services, package registries, and code analysis platforms. This repository hosts both the frontend server code and a badge-making NPM library, alongside a badge design specification, positioning it as a developer productivity tool specifically for generating visual status indicators.
