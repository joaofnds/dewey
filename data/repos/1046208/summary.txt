The Clojure Koans is an interactive learning platform designed to teach Clojure programming through hands-on exercises targeting software developers and functional programming newcomers. Built as a test-driven learning system using Leiningen build tooling and JVM infrastructure, it provides auto-running koans (practice exercises) that guide learners through Clojure language fundamentals by filling in code blanks to make failing tests pass. The platform supports multiple deployment environments including native JDK installations, Vagrant virtualization, and Docker containerization, while offering REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) integration for interactive experimentation. This educational tool addresses the domain of functional programming education by providing structured, progressive exercises that teach Clojure syntax, semantics, and idioms through practical application rather than theoretical instruction, making it accessible to developers transitioning from imperative to functional programming paradigms.
