The `clojure-koans` repository provides interactive exercises for learning the Clojure programming language. It guides users through a series of failing tests, requiring them to fill in code blanks to make the tests pass, thus teaching Clojure fundamentals and syntax. The project leverages Clojure and utilizes Leiningen as a build tool, with installation options including direct dependency installation, Vagrant, and Docker. This is an educational project and code tutorial intended for individuals seeking to learn Clojure.
