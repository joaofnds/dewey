This repository contains a shell script-based wireless network penetration testing tool designed for cybersecurity professionals and penetration testers. Built specifically for Kali Linux environments, it provides an automated interface for conducting wireless security assessments against WEP, WPS, WPA, and WPA2 encrypted networks. The script integrates existing Kali Linux wireless hacking tools like aircrack-ng, reaver, and related utilities into a unified command-line interface, streamlining the process of wireless network reconnaissance, packet capture, and credential cracking. Primary users include ethical hackers, security researchers, and network administrators performing authorized security audits to identify vulnerabilities in wireless infrastructure, eliminating the need to manually execute complex sequences of low-level wireless security testing commands.
