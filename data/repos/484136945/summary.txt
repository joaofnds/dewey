LiteFS is a FUSE-based file system designed for replicating SQLite databases across a cluster of machines. It intercepts write operations to SQLite databases and records changes on a per-transaction level within LTX files, enabling database replication. Implemented in Go, this project aims to facilitate consistent database access across distributed systems, functioning as a passthrough file system. It is currently in beta and is designed to work with SQLite databases.
