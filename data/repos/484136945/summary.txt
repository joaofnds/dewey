LiteFS is a FUSE-based distributed file system written in Go that enables SQLite database replication across machine clusters. Targeting distributed systems and cloud infrastructure domains, it operates as a passthrough file system that intercepts SQLite write operations to detect transaction boundaries and records changes in LTX format files. The system addresses the challenge of scaling SQLite deployments beyond single-machine limitations by providing automatic database synchronization without application-level changes. Primary users include DevOps engineers, system administrators, and backend developers building distributed applications who need SQLite's simplicity with multi-node availability, particularly in edge computing and microservices architectures where lightweight database replication is essential.
