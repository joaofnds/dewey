Feroxbuster is a high-performance web content discovery tool written in Rust, designed for cybersecurity professionals conducting penetration testing and security assessments. It performs forced browsing attacks by using brute force techniques combined with wordlists to enumerate hidden directories, files, and endpoints on web servers that aren't directly linked or referenced by applications. The tool recursively searches target web applications to discover sensitive resources like source code, configuration files, credentials, and internal system information that may be accessible but not publicly advertised. Built for penetration testers, security researchers, and ethical hackers, feroxbuster leverages Rust's performance characteristics to deliver fast, concurrent HTTP requests while providing comprehensive enumeration capabilities for web application security testing and vulnerability assessment workflows.
