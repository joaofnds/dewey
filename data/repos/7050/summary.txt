Prawn is a pure Ruby PDF generation library designed for programmatic document creation in web development and Ruby applications. It provides low-level PDF manipulation capabilities including vector graphics rendering, typography with TrueType font embedding, image insertion (PNG/JPG), text layout with internationalization support, and PDF security features like encryption. The library operates at the PDF object tree level, enabling custom extensions while maintaining performance through native Ruby implementation without external dependencies. Targeted at Ruby developers building reporting systems, document generators, or applications requiring dynamic PDF creation, Prawn serves as an alternative to HTML-to-PDF converters by offering direct PDF specification control for complex layout requirements in enterprise applications and content management systems.
