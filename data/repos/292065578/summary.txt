`czkawka` is a multiplatform, Rust-based standalone application designed for identifying and removing unnecessary files, including duplicates, empty folders, and similar images, music, and videos, to optimize disk space. The application offers both a GUI (GTK 4 and Slint) and a CLI frontend, providing features such as duplicate detection based on various criteria (filename, size, hash), similar image/music/video finding, and invalid symbolic link detection. Its architecture utilizes the Rust programming language, leveraging multithreading and caching for improved performance across Linux, Windows, macOS, and FreeBSD environments. The project is targeted towards end-users seeking a comprehensive file management tool.
