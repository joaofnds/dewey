Gitsigns.nvim is a Git integration plugin for Neovim that provides real-time visual Git status indicators and workflow commands directly within text buffers. Built in Lua specifically for Neovim 0.9+, it targets software developers working in Git-managed codebases by displaying added, modified, and deleted line markers in the sign column, enabling inline hunk staging/unstaging, blame annotations, and diff visualization without leaving the editor. The plugin integrates with Neovim's native UI components including sign columns, virtual text, quickfix lists, and popup windows to surface Git repository state and facilitate common version control operations like hunk navigation, staging workflows, and commit history inspection, streamlining the developer experience for Git-based source code management within the Neovim ecosystem.
