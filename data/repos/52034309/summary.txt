Zap is a high-performance structured logging library for Go applications, designed to address performance bottlenecks in enterprise-scale backend systems and microservices. It provides two APIs: a zero-allocation Logger for performance-critical hot paths and a SugaredLogger with printf-style convenience methods, both supporting leveled logging with structured key-value fields. The library features a reflection-free JSON encoder and minimizes memory allocations through strongly-typed field construction, making it significantly faster than standard library logging and competing packages like logrus or go-kit. Targeted at Go backend developers, DevOps engineers, and system architects building high-throughput services, zap solves the critical problem of logging overhead in production applications where every nanosecond and memory allocation impacts system performance and scalability.
