`uber-go/zap` is a Go library providing high-performance, structured, and leveled logging capabilities. It allows developers to implement efficient logging within their Go applications with features like strongly typed fields and a reflection-free JSON encoder. This library offers both a high-performance `Logger` optimized for structured logging and a `SugaredLogger` with a more familiar, `printf`-style API. It is designed as a developer productivity tool, offering performance advantages over existing structured logging packages, and is intended for use within Go applications.
