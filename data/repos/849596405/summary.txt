x86-64 Playground is a browser-based assembly editor and debugger that enables interactive x86-64 assembly programming and reverse engineering education through WebAssembly. Built for cybersecurity professionals, assembly programmers, and computer science educators, it leverages a WebAssembly port of the Blink x86-64-Linux emulator to provide client-side execution and debugging capabilities. The platform integrates multiple assemblers (GNU Binutils, FASM, NASM) with GDB-like debugging features including step execution, memory visualization, and register inspection. Compiled using Emscripten and deployable as a static web application, it addresses the accessibility barrier in assembly language tooling by eliminating local development environment setup requirements while maintaining offline-first functionality for binary exploitation research and reverse engineering workflows.
