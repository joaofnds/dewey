`x86-64-playground` is a web-based application providing an online assembly editor and debugger for the x86-64 architecture. It allows users to write, assemble (using GNU Binutils, Fasm, or Nasm), and debug assembly code directly within a web browser, emulating an x86-64-Linux environment using a WebAssembly (Wasm) port of the Blink emulator. Key features include a GDB-inspired debugger with disassembler, memory and register visualization, and the ability to share or embed assembly snippets. The project is a standalone, client-side web application written in C, leveraging Emscripten for Wasm compilation, with a TypeScript wrapper for the emulator APIs.
