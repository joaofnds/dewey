Beachball is a TypeScript-based semantic versioning automation tool designed for JavaScript/Node.js monorepo management in web development workflows. It integrates with Git repositories and npm registries to automate version bumping, changelog generation, and package publishing according to semantic versioning (semver) principles. The tool provides commands for creating change files, checking version requirements, bumping package versions, publishing to npm registries with dist-tags, and synchronizing published versions across monorepo packages. Targeted at JavaScript developers and DevOps engineers managing multi-package repositories, it solves the complex problem of coordinating version releases across interdependent packages while maintaining proper semantic versioning and automated changelog generation, particularly in large-scale monorepo environments where manual version management becomes impractical.
