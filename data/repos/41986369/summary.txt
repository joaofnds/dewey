TiDB is an open-source distributed SQL database system written in Go, designed for enterprise applications requiring horizontal scalability and high availability. It targets database administrators, backend developers, and DevOps engineers working with large-scale transactional workloads. The system implements a distributed architecture with separated compute and storage layers, using Raft consensus protocol for consistency and two-phase commit for ACID transactions. TiDB provides MySQL 8.0 wire protocol compatibility, enabling seamless migration from existing MySQL deployments. It features hybrid transactional/analytical processing (HTAP) capabilities through TiKV row-based storage and TiFlash columnar storage engines, supporting both OLTP and OLAP workloads within a single platform for cloud-native and Kubernetes environments.
