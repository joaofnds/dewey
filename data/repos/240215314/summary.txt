This repository is a curated collection of Docker Compose configuration samples designed for containerized application development and local environment setup. Targeting DevOps engineers, full-stack developers, and system administrators, it provides ready-to-use compose files for multi-service application stacks including web frameworks (React, Angular, Django, Flask, Spring), databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis), reverse proxies (Nginx), and monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack). The samples demonstrate service orchestration patterns for common technology combinations like NGINX/Node.js/Redis, React/Express/MySQL, and Go/PostgreSQL, solving the problem of complex multi-container application configuration and dependency management. Each sample serves as a starting point for local development environments, eliminating the need to manually configure Docker Compose files for standard application architectures.
