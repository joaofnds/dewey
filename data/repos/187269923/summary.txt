Malli is a high-performance data specification library for Clojure and ClojureScript, providing data-driven schema definitions for validation, value transformation, and value generation. It supports multiple syntaxes, including vector, map, and lite, enabling features such as error message generation, JSON Schema conversion, and schema inference.  Key functionalities include schema definitions as data, support for recursive schemas, function schemas with clj-kondo and Typed Clojure integration, and value parsing/unparsing. This library aims to facilitate dynamic data model management in Clojure and ClojureScript applications, making it a valuable tool for developers working with dynamic multi-tenant systems.
