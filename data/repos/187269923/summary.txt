Malli is a high-performance data specification and validation library for Clojure/ClojureScript applications, targeting backend and full-stack web developers building dynamic, data-driven systems. It provides schema-as-data definitions with validation, transformation, coercion, and code generation capabilities, addressing the need for runtime-editable, serializable data models that can be persisted and transmitted across network boundaries. The library supports JSON Schema interoperability, function schema validation with clj-kondo integration, property-based testing via generators, and schema inference from sample data. Malli solves the limitation of existing solutions like Prismatic Schema and clojure.spec by offering first-class schema serialization, multi-tenant system support, and comprehensive tooling for schema visualization, transformation, and error handling in enterprise Clojure applications.
