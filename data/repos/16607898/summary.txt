Harness Open Source is a comprehensive DevOps platform written in Go that provides end-to-end development infrastructure including source control management, CI/CD pipelines, hosted development environments (Gitspaces), and artifact registries. Built as the next-generation evolution of Drone CI, it targets DevOps engineers and development teams seeking an integrated alternative to fragmented toolchains like GitHub + Jenkins + Docker Hub. The platform leverages Docker containerization, Git SCM, gRPC APIs, and a React-based web interface, offering both REST APIs and container registry functionality with OCI compliance. It addresses the complexity of managing separate tools for code hosting, continuous integration/delivery, and artifact management by consolidating these capabilities into a single, self-hostable platform that can be deployed via Docker containers.
