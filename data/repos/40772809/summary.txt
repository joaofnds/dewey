AdonisJS Core is a TypeScript-first, full-stack MVC web framework for Node.js designed for building web applications and API servers. It targets web developers who need a comprehensive backend framework with built-in support for routing, database ORM, authentication, validation, and testing capabilities. The framework follows MVC architectural patterns and emphasizes developer ergonomics through TypeScript's static typing system, providing a Laravel-inspired development experience for the Node.js ecosystem. It addresses the complexity of modern web application development by offering an opinionated, batteries-included approach with official packages for common functionality like session management, file uploads, and database migrations, enabling developers to rapidly build scalable web services and full-stack applications.
