AskQL is a TypeScript-based query language and runtime that extends GraphQL syntax to enable server-side script execution within queries. Targeting web developers and API architects, it functions as a programmable alternative to traditional GraphQL and REST APIs, allowing frontend developers to embed executable code directly in queries without backend deployments. The system uses an isolated Virtual Machine for secure script execution and supports resource-based access control to data sources including eCommerce platforms (SFCC, Commercetools) and databases (MongoDB, MySQL). Built on Node.js with Express middleware integration, AskQL addresses the development bottleneck where frontend teams depend on backend release cycles for new API endpoints, enabling dynamic JAMstack and mobile applications with server-side data processing capabilities while maintaining security through controlled resource access.
