AskQL is a TypeScript-based query language and execution environment designed as an alternative to GraphQL and REST APIs, enabling server-side execution of scripts directly attached to queries. It provides a GraphQL-compatible syntax and features like resource management for controlled data access, with plans for access and secret management. Functionality includes a CLI interpreter for scripting and a playground for testing, offering built-in resources for integrating with various data sources such as e-commerce platforms and databases. This project is a standalone application, offering a query language, a CLI tool and a server endpoint primarily targeted at frontend developers seeking to simplify backend interactions and accelerate application development.
