Cloudflared is a command-line tunneling daemon written in Go that enables secure reverse proxy connections between Cloudflare's network and private origin servers without requiring firewall modifications or public IP exposure. Targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators, it implements zero-trust network access by establishing outbound-only connections that proxy HTTP/HTTPS and Layer 4 TCP traffic (SSH, RDP) through Cloudflare's edge network. The client supports both public DNS routing and private network access via WARP, eliminating traditional VPN requirements. Key use cases include exposing local development servers, securing production applications behind Cloudflare's security stack, and enabling remote access to internal services while maintaining strict network security postures through Cloudflare's Zero Trust architecture.
