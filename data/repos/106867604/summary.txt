`cloudflared` is a Go-based command-line client and daemon for Cloudflare Tunnel, facilitating secure and private origin connections. It acts as a reverse proxy, enabling secure traffic tunneling from the Cloudflare network to user origins, bypassing the need to expose firewall ports. Core functionalities include establishing tunnels, routing traffic via DNS or Cloudflare Load Balancers, and Layer 4 access for protocols like SSH and RDP. This standalone application, designed for system administrators and network engineers, allows secure access to private services, with support for Docker deployments and integration with Cloudflare's Zero Trust platform.
