ImageOptim is a standalone GUI application for macOS designed to optimize images through lossless compression. It leverages a suite of external tools, including Zopfli, OxiPNG, and MozJPEG, to reduce image file sizes. Built using Xcode, the project's functionality is heavily reliant on integrating and managing these third-party image optimization utilities. This project targets developers and designers seeking to improve website performance and reduce storage consumption by minimizing image file sizes without sacrificing image quality.
