Built with Objective-C/Swift using Xcode and integrating Rust components, it targets web developers, designers, and content creators who need to compress PNG, JPEG, GIF, and SVG files without quality loss for web performance optimization. The application automates the complex process of running multiple command-line optimization tools, providing drag-and-drop functionality to reduce file sizes for faster website loading times and improved user experience in web development workflows.
