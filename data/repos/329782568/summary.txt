Dioxus is a cross-platform UI framework written in Rust that enables developers to build applications for web, desktop, and mobile platforms using a single codebase. It implements a React-like component model with JSX-style syntax (rsx!), virtual DOM, and signals-based state management. The framework compiles to WebAssembly for web deployment, uses webview-based rendering for desktop applications, and supports native mobile development for Android and iOS. It includes server-side rendering capabilities, hot-reloading development tools, and an integrated CLI for building and bundling applications. Dioxus targets Rust developers seeking to create full-stack applications without JavaScript, leveraging Rust's type safety and performance for UI development across multiple platforms while maintaining familiar React development patterns.
