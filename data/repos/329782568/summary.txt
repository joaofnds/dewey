Dioxus is a fullstack, cross-platform application framework written in Rust for building web, desktop, and mobile user interfaces. It employs a virtual DOM and a component-based architecture, similar to React, with a focus on leveraging HTML and CSS for UI rendering across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and web (WASM). Key functionalities include integrated hot-reloading, signals-based state management, type-safe routing, and server functions for backend logic, enabling single-codebase deployment. This framework provides a CLI for building and bundling applications and is designed for frontend developers seeking to create performant and native-feeling applications in a unified codebase.
