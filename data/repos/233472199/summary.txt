Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS) is an open-source Windows license activation toolkit written primarily in Batchfile and PowerShell, targeting system administrators and end-users who need to activate Microsoft Windows and Office products. The repository implements multiple activation methods including HWID (Hardware ID), Ohook, TSforge, KMS38, and Online KMS protocols to bypass Microsoft's licensing validation systems. It provides both PowerShell-based remote execution via `irm` commands and traditional batch script deployment methods, supporting Windows Vista through Windows 11 and various Office versions including Microsoft 365. The toolkit includes advanced troubleshooting capabilities and unattended activation modes, serving the system administration and IT support domain by automating Microsoft product license activation processes that would otherwise require manual intervention or legitimate license keys.
