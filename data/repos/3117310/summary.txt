**mu** is a C++ email management toolkit designed for handling Maildir-format email archives through indexing and search capabilities. Built on Xapian full-text search engine with GMime and GLib dependencies, it provides command-line email indexing, querying via custom search syntax, and message manipulation functions. The repository includes **mu4e**, a complete Emacs-based email client written in Elisp, and **mu-guile** Scheme language bindings for programmatic email processing. Primary users are Linux/Unix system administrators, Emacs power users, and developers who need efficient email archival and retrieval solutions beyond traditional IMAP clients. The toolkit addresses email workflow optimization in technical environments where users manage large volumes of email and require fast, sophisticated search capabilities across message headers, body text, and attachments while maintaining local email storage control.
