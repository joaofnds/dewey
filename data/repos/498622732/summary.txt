nvim-ufo is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that modernizes code folding functionality for software developers using the Neovim text editor. It integrates with Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients, TreeSitter parsers, and fallback indentation-based folding to provide accurate code structure detection across multiple programming languages. The plugin addresses performance limitations of traditional Neovim folding methods by implementing asynchronous fold detection, visual enhancements like penetrating colors for folded regions, and preview capabilities for inspecting folded content without full expansion. It supports multiple fold providers including nvim-lsp, coc.nvim, and TreeSitter, with customizable fallback strategies. Target users are software developers, particularly those working in polyglot environments who require efficient code navigation and visualization tools within the Neovim ecosystem for improved development workflow and code comprehension.
