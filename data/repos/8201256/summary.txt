`websocketd` is a command-line tool written in Go that facilitates the creation of WebSocket servers from programs that utilize STDIN/STDOUT. It acts as a WebSocket server proxy, transforming standard input/output interactions into WebSocket communications, enabling any executable to function as a WebSocket endpoint. Key functionalities include accepting WebSocket connections, forking the specified process, and bi-directionally piping data between the WebSocket connection and the process's STDIN/STDOUT streams, providing features like a static file server and CGI server. This standalone application is designed to simplify the development of WebSocket-enabled applications, targeting developers seeking to quickly expose command-line utilities or scripts via WebSockets.
