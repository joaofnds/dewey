websocketd is a command-line proxy tool written in Go that bridges STDIN/STDOUT programs with WebSocket connections, functioning as an inetd-like daemon for WebSocket servers. It targets web developers and system administrators who need to expose existing CLI tools, scripts, or system utilities through WebSocket APIs without modifying the underlying programs. The tool forks processes on each WebSocket connection, pipes client messages to the program's STDIN, and streams STDOUT back as WebSocket messages line-by-line. This enables rapid prototyping of real-time web applications by wrapping shell scripts, system monitoring tools, or any executable that uses standard I/O streams, eliminating the need for developers to implement WebSocket networking libraries in their preferred scripting languages like Python, Bash, or Ruby for simple streaming data applications.
