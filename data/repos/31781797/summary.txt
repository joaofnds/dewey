`Lack` is a Common Lisp library providing modular components for building web applications, designed as the core of Clack. It defines application interfaces and middleware, facilitating request handling through an environment property list, and response construction using status codes, headers, and body data, with support for delayed and streaming responses.  Functionality includes session management, access logging, and static file serving via middleware, built with a flexible builder DSL for composing applications. This library is intended for Common Lisp developers building web applications, offering a performant and modular approach compared to alternative systems.
