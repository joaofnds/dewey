The mholt/archiver repository was a Go library designed for programmatic archive file manipulation, providing unified APIs for creating, extracting, and streaming various archive and compression formats including ZIP, TAR, 7-Zip, RAR, and compression algorithms like Gzip, Brotli, LZ4, and Zstandard. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and Go developers working on file processing pipelines, backup systems, and deployment automation, it solved the problem of handling multiple archive formats through inconsistent native libraries by offering a single, consistent interface. The library supported both streaming and traditional file operations, making it suitable for processing large archives in memory-constrained environments and CI/CD workflows that require reliable archive manipulation across different formats.
