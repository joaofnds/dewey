Asynq is a Go library for building distributed task queue systems that enables asynchronous background job processing in web applications and microservices architectures. Built on Redis as the message broker, it provides a robust framework for enqueueing, scheduling, and processing tasks across multiple worker nodes with features like automatic retries, task deduplication, priority queues, and failure recovery. The library targets Go developers building scalable web applications, APIs, and distributed systems who need to offload time-consuming operations like email delivery, image processing, data synchronization, and batch operations from their main request-response cycle. It includes monitoring capabilities with Prometheus integration, a web UI for queue management, and supports Redis Sentinel for high availability, making it suitable for production environments requiring reliable background task processing with horizontal scaling capabilities.
