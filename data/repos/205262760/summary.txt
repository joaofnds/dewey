**actions/github-script** is a GitHub Actions utility that enables developers to execute JavaScript code directly within CI/CD workflows with seamless GitHub API integration. Built in TypeScript, it provides a pre-authenticated Octokit REST client, workflow context objects, and access to the Actions toolkit packages (core, glob, io, exec) for comprehensive automation capabilities. The action addresses the common DevOps need for programmatic repository management by allowing developers to create comments, apply labels, manage issues and pull requests, and perform complex GitHub operations without writing separate Node.js applications. It targets DevOps engineers and workflow developers who need to automate GitHub repository interactions, implement custom CI/CD logic, and create dynamic responses to repository events while maintaining security through proper input handling and script injection prevention.
