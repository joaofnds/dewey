`actions/github-script` is a GitHub Action facilitating workflow scripting through JavaScript, enabling programmatic interaction with the GitHub API. It provides a pre-authenticated `octokit/rest.js` client, along with contextual data and access to the `@actions/core`, `@actions/glob`, `@actions/io`, and `@actions/exec` packages, allowing users to perform a wide range of GitHub operations directly within their workflows.  The action leverages TypeScript for its implementation, targeting developers who need to automate complex interactions with the GitHub platform, such as issue management, labeling, commenting, and interacting with pull requests, and supports both REST and GraphQL APIs. This project is an action/plugin for GitHub Actions, enhancing developer productivity within the GitHub ecosystem.
