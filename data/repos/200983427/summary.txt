This repository provides a refactoring Kata based on an example from Martin Fowler's "Refactoring" book. It offers a starting point for refactoring exercises, including a sample implementation and accompanying automated tests using an Approval testing approach. The project focuses on improving existing code by implementing changes like generating HTML output, and supports the addition of new play types. The core technology is Pascal, demonstrating the application of refactoring principles. This is an example/template project for software developers, facilitating practical refactoring practice.
