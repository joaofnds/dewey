This repository provides a multilingual implementation of the Theatrical Players refactoring kata from Martin Fowler's "Refactoring" book, designed for software engineering education and practice. The codebase simulates a billing system for theatrical companies that generates invoices for play performances, calculating costs based on play types (tragedy, comedy) and audience size. Built primarily in Pascal with implementations across multiple programming languages, it includes comprehensive approval tests to ensure refactoring safety. The kata targets software developers learning refactoring techniques, code quality improvement, and test-driven development practices. The main technical challenge involves restructuring legacy code to support new requirements like HTML output generation and additional play types (history, pastoral) while maintaining existing functionality through automated testing and incremental refactoring steps.
