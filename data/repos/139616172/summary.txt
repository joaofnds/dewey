Lunar is a macOS application designed to control the brightness, contrast, and volume of external monitors, leveraging the DDC/CI protocol where supported. It offers adaptive brightness based on external light sensors, built-in MacBook/iMac sensors, or location-based sunrise/sunset times, along with features like app-specific presets and hotkey control for various monitor functions, including input switching and screen orientation. Built using Swift and SwiftUI, this standalone application allows users to extend native brightness controls and offers additional display management capabilities for macOS users with external displays, including XDR and HDR support.
