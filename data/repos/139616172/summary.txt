Lunar is a macOS desktop application built in Swift/SwiftUI that provides hardware-level monitor control for external displays through DDC/CI (Display Data Channel Command Interface) protocol communication. The application targets Mac users with multi-monitor setups, enabling direct manipulation of display hardware parameters including brightness (0-1600 nits for XDR/HDR displays), contrast, volume, and input switching without software overlays. It implements multiple adaptive brightness algorithms using ambient light sensors, location-based solar calculations, and MacBook/iMac built-in sensors. Key features include keyboard shortcuts, app-specific display presets, monitor blackout functionality, and support for various connection types (HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, USB-C). The solution addresses the limitation of macOS native brightness controls being restricted to built-in displays, providing system administrators and power users with comprehensive external monitor management capabilities.
