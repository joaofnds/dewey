Astro is a TypeScript-based web framework specifically designed for building content-driven websites using a hybrid static site generation approach. It implements an "islands architecture" that enables selective hydration of interactive components while maintaining predominantly static HTML output for optimal performance. The framework supports multiple frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, SolidJS) through its integration system and provides deployment adapters for various platforms including Node.js, Vercel, and Cloudflare. Astro targets web developers building blogs, documentation sites, and content-heavy applications who need modern developer experience with component-based architecture while prioritizing lightweight bundle sizes and fast loading times. The monorepo structure includes the core framework, CLI tooling, and ecosystem integrations for comprehensive web development workflows.
