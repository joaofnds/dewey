This repository provides C code examples related to memory mapping (mmap) concepts, derived from a lecture available on YouTube. It demonstrates the practical application of the mmap system call. The project utilizes C as its primary language, requiring a C compiler like GCC and NASM for assembly, with a simple `make` build process. This serves as an educational resource and example project focused on illustrating low-level memory management techniques.
