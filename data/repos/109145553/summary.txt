Podman is a daemonless container management tool written in Go that provides Docker-compatible CLI and REST API interfaces for managing OCI containers, pods, and images on Linux systems. Targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators, it leverages libpod for container lifecycle management, Netavark for networking, and user namespaces for rootless operation without requiring elevated privileges. The tool addresses container orchestration needs by supporting multi-container pods, image pulling/pushing from registries, checkpoint/restore via CRIU, and cross-platform deployment through virtual machines on Windows/Mac. Unlike Docker's daemon-based architecture, Podman operates without a persistent background service, reducing security attack surface and resource consumption while maintaining full compatibility with existing Docker workflows and Kubernetes pod specifications.
