Podman is a command-line tool and library for managing Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers and pods on Linux, Windows, and macOS systems. It provides functionalities for container lifecycle management, including image pulling, building, running, and removal, along with pod creation and management. Built using Go, Podman supports Docker-compatible CLI commands and a REST API for remote management, leveraging libraries like `libpod`, `containers/image`, and `containers/storage`. The project is a standalone application and developer productivity tool for system administrators and developers involved in containerized application deployment and orchestration, offering rootless container execution for improved security.
