Grip is a Python-based command-line tool that provides local preview capabilities for GitHub-flavored Markdown files, particularly README.md files, before committing to version control. Built on Flask web framework, it creates a local HTTP server that leverages GitHub's official Markdown API to render files with identical styling and formatting as they would appear on GitHub. The tool targets software developers and technical writers working in web development and open-source projects who need to validate Markdown rendering during readme-driven development workflows. It supports both server mode for live preview with auto-refresh and export functionality to generate standalone HTML files, handles stdin/stdout operations for integration with other CLI tools, and includes GitHub API authentication to bypass rate limits, addressing the core problem of Markdown rendering inconsistencies between local editors and GitHub's actual display.
