`public-activity` is a Ruby library designed for tracking user actions and generating activity feeds within Rails applications. It provides an easy way to monitor changes to ActiveRecord, Mongoid 3, and MongoMapper models, mirroring the functionality of GitHub's activity streams. Key features include the ability to track create, update, and destroy events automatically through model inclusion and the `tracked` macro, along with support for custom activity creation. The library leverages Rails' view rendering capabilities for displaying activities, supporting layouts, locals, and I18n for customization and internationalization. This project is a Ruby gem, intended for developers building Rails applications.
