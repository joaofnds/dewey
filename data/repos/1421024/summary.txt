PublicActivity is a Ruby gem designed for Rails web applications that provides automated activity tracking and feed generation for ActiveRecord, Mongoid, and MongoMapper models. It automatically records CRUD operations (create, update, destroy) and supports custom activity logging, similar to GitHub's activity streams. The gem targets Rails developers building social applications, content management systems, or any web application requiring user activity feeds, audit trails, or notification systems. It integrates seamlessly with Rails 6.1+ and Ruby 3.0+, offering view helpers for rendering activity feeds, I18n support for localization, and flexible templating options. The primary use case is eliminating the manual implementation of activity tracking infrastructure, allowing developers to quickly add news feeds, user dashboards, and activity timelines to their Rails applications with minimal configuration.
