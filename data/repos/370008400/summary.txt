Scittle is a browser-based Clojure/ClojureScript interpreter that enables developers to execute Clojure code directly within HTML script tags using the Small Clojure Interpreter (SCI). Targeting web development, it eliminates the need for traditional ClojureScript compilation workflows by providing runtime interpretation of Clojure code in browsers. The project leverages SCI's sandboxed evaluation capabilities and includes nREPL integration for interactive development. Built with Clojure and distributed via JSDelivr CDN, Scittle serves frontend developers and Clojure programmers who want to prototype, experiment, or build web applications without complex build toolchains. The tool addresses the friction of ClojureScript setup by offering immediate code execution similar to how JavaScript works natively in browsers, making Clojure more accessible for rapid web development and educational purposes.
