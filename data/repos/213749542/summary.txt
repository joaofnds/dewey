**rage** is a Rust-based file encryption tool implementing the age specification, designed for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and security-conscious developers requiring secure file encryption with UNIX-style composability. It provides a command-line interface and Rust library for encrypting/decrypting files using modern cryptographic primitives including Curve25519 elliptic curve cryptography and scrypt key derivation. The tool supports multiple recipient types (age public keys, SSH keys), passphrase-based encryption, and hardware token integration via YubiKey plugins. Following zero-configuration and secure-by-default principles, it eliminates complex configuration options while maintaining interoperability with the reference Go implementation, making it suitable for DevOps workflows, backup systems, and secure file storage scenarios where simplicity and security are paramount.
