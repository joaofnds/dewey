`rage` is a command-line tool and Rust library for secure file encryption, leveraging the *age* format. It provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting files using explicit keys, passphrases, or SSH keys, and supports multiple recipients. Key functionalities include UNIX-style composability, integration with hardware security modules (e.g., YubiKeys), and support for armored output. The project offers a CLI application for file encryption and a corresponding Rust crate for integration into other applications.
