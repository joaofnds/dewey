Keploy is a Go-based API testing automation tool designed for web developers working with REST APIs, databases, and microservices architectures. It functions as a test generation agent that captures live API traffic and database interactions, automatically converting them into executable test cases with corresponding mocks and stubs. The tool operates by recording HTTP requests/responses and database calls during application runtime, then replaying these interactions during testing phases without requiring external dependencies. Built for developers working in API-first development environments, Keploy integrates with existing unit testing frameworks to provide combined test coverage reporting. It addresses the challenge of creating comprehensive integration tests by eliminating manual test case writing and mock data generation, supporting multiple programming languages including Go, Java, Python, and Node.js applications.
