Keploy is a developer-centric API testing tool designed to accelerate API and integration testing by generating tests and mocks/stubs from existing API traffic. Written in Go, it captures and replays API calls, including database interactions, to create test cases, enabling faster testing than traditional unit tests. Key features include automated test generation, support for multiple programming languages, CI/CD integration, and the ability to record and replay complex API flows. It functions as a standalone agent, with a target audience of software developers focused on improving API testing efficiency and coverage within their applications.
