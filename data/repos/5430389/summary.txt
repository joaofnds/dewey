`rrule.js` is a TypeScript library providing functionality to work with recurrence rules for calendar dates, adhering to the iCalendar RFC (RFC5545) standard and extending it with additional features. The library enables parsing, serialization, and generation of recurring date instances, supporting various recurrence frequencies, intervals, and parameters as defined in the RFC, including timezone handling through the Intl API. Key features include the `RRule` and `RRuleSet` classes for defining and manipulating recurrence rules and sets, along with methods for retrieving occurrences, converting to/from iCalendar strings, and a text-based natural language interface. This project is a library designed for JavaScript developers, enabling the creation of calendar applications, scheduling tools, and similar solutions.
