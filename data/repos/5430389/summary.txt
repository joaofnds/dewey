**rrule.js** is a TypeScript/JavaScript library for parsing, generating, and manipulating calendar recurrence rules according to the iCalendar RFC 5545 specification. Targeting web developers building calendar and scheduling applications, it provides comprehensive APIs for creating complex recurring event patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) with support for exclusion rules, timezone handling via the Intl API, and natural language parsing. The library offers RRule and RRuleSet classes for defining single and composite recurrence patterns, methods for generating occurrence dates within specified ranges, and bidirectional conversion between programmatic rule objects and iCalendar RRULE strings. Inspired by Python's dateutil library, it solves the complex problem of accurately calculating recurring calendar events in browser and Node.js environments, making it essential for developers implementing calendar functionality, meeting schedulers, and event management systems.
