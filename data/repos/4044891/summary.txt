Realm is a mobile-first object database SDK for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS applications, implemented in Objective-C with Swift bindings. It serves as a direct replacement for Core Data and SQLite, providing an object-oriented data persistence layer that eliminates the need for ORM mapping. The framework offers thread-safe operations, real-time data synchronization, automatic change notifications, and native SwiftUI integration through reactive data binding. Key features include AES-256 encryption, offline-first architecture, and live object updates that automatically propagate changes across the application. Targeted at iOS/macOS developers, Realm addresses the complexity of mobile data persistence by providing intuitive APIs for CRUD operations, relationship management, and cross-device data synchronization through MongoDB Atlas Device Sync integration.
