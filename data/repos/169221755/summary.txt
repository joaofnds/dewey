`efm-langserver` is a general-purpose Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation written in Go, designed to integrate with various text editors and IDEs to provide linting and formatting capabilities. It acts as a bridge, enabling the use of external linters and formatters for numerous programming languages and file types by parsing error messages from command-line tools. Key functionalities include configuration via YAML or the DidChangeConfiguration notification, supporting capabilities like document formatting, range formatting, and code actions, and providing example configurations for several popular editors like Vim, Neovim, VSCode, and Helix. This project is a developer productivity tool, specifically a standalone application (language server) and plugin/extension, targeted at software developers seeking to improve code quality and consistency through integration with linters and formatters within their editors.
