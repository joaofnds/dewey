efm-langserver is a general-purpose Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation written in Go that serves as a universal adapter for integrating linters, formatters, and other command-line tools into LSP-compatible editors like Vim, Neovim, Emacs, and VSCode. It addresses the problem of having to write separate LSP servers for each linting/formatting tool by providing a configurable bridge that can parse error message formats from arbitrary commands and translate them into LSP diagnostics. The server supports real-time linting, code formatting, hover information, and code actions through YAML-based configuration that maps file types to their respective tools (eslint, prettier, hadolint, etc.). Primarily targeting software developers working across multiple programming languages, it enables consistent IDE-like features in text editors without requiring language-specific LSP implementations for every linter or formatter in their development workflow.
