Storeon is a minimal event-based state management library for frontend web development, serving as a lightweight alternative to Redux at only 185 bytes minified and gzipped. It implements a Redux-like architecture using event-driven patterns with reducers and modules, supporting React, Preact, Angular, Vue, and Svelte frameworks through dedicated hooks and context providers. The library addresses state management complexity in JavaScript single-page applications by providing a modular system where business logic is separated into independent modules that respond to dispatched events and update application state. Targeted at frontend developers building component-based web applications, Storeon offers performance optimizations through selective re-rendering based on state changes, along with an ecosystem of plugins for routing, localStorage persistence, cross-tab synchronization, and WebSocket integration. The project is now deprecated in favor of Nano Stores.
