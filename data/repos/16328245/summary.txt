Hexpm is the official API server and web platform that powers hex.pm, the package repository for the Elixir programming language ecosystem. Built using Phoenix framework and Elixir, it provides package management infrastructure including package hosting, version control, dependency resolution, and developer authentication services. The platform targets Elixir developers who need to publish, discover, and manage libraries and dependencies for their applications. It utilizes PostgreSQL with JSONB support and specific extensions (pg_trgm, pgcrypto) for search and cryptographic operations, along with Node.js for frontend asset compilation. The system serves as the central registry that enables Elixir's Mix build tool to fetch packages, making it critical infrastructure for the Elixir development community similar to how npm serves JavaScript or RubyGems serves Ruby developers.
