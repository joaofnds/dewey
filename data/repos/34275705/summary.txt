Redox OS is a Unix-like operating system written entirely in Rust, implementing a microkernel architecture for enhanced security and reliability. This repository serves as the build system orchestrating compilation of core OS components including the kernel, RedoxFS filesystem, Orbital display server, relibc POSIX library, and Ion shell. Targeting systems programmers and OS developers, Redox provides POSIX compatibility while leveraging Rust's memory safety guarantees to eliminate common kernel vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free bugs. The project addresses the need for a modern, secure operating system foundation by combining microkernel isolation principles with Rust's compile-time safety checks, offering an alternative to traditional C-based kernels for embedded systems, servers, and desktop environments where security and correctness are paramount.
