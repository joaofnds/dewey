This repository is the build system for Redox OS, a microkernel-based operating system written in Rust. The build system orchestrates the compilation and integration of core operating system components, including the kernel, file system, display server, and core utilities.  It leverages a shell-based build process to construct a full-featured operating system, providing source code compatibility with Rust, Linux, and BSD programs. This project constitutes a critical infrastructural component for Redox OS development, serving system developers and contributors.
