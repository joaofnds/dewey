Livebook is an interactive code notebook web application built with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView for data science and exploratory programming workflows. It provides a browser-based environment where data scientists and Elixir developers can write executable code cells with Markdown documentation, visualize data through Vega-Lite charts and Kino widgets, and collaborate in real-time on analytical workflows. The platform supports custom Elixir runtimes, integrates with existing projects, and stores notebooks in a versionable `.livemd` format. Built on Phoenix's real-time capabilities, it enables distributed computing scenarios and automated data pipelines, targeting data practitioners who need reproducible, shareable computational documents with rich visualization capabilities in the Elixir ecosystem.
