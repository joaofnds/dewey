k3d is a DevOps tool written in Go that enables developers and system administrators to run multi-node Kubernetes clusters locally using Docker containers. It wraps Rancher's lightweight k3s Kubernetes distribution in Docker containers, allowing users to spin up complete Kubernetes environments on a single machine for development, testing, and CI/CD workflows. The tool targets the cloud-native development domain, solving the problem of complex local Kubernetes setup by providing a simple command-line interface to create, manage, and destroy containerized k3s clusters. It primarily serves developers working with Kubernetes applications who need fast, disposable cluster environments without the overhead of full Kubernetes installations, making it essential for cloud-native application development and testing workflows.
