`fake-service` is a Go-based testing tool designed to simulate upstream service behavior for testing microservice communications, service meshes, and related scenarios. This standalone application provides both HTTP and gRPC endpoints, returning configurable JSON payloads, and supports error injection, rate limiting, and service delay simulation for testing resilience and observability. Key features include the ability to generate CPU and memory load, support for tracing via Zipkin and Datadog, and a UI for visualizing HTTP responses. It is intended for use by developers and testers to validate the behavior of distributed systems.
