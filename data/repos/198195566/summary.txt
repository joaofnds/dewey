Fake Service is a Go-based testing utility designed for DevOps and microservices development that simulates upstream service communications through both HTTP and gRPC protocols. Built for testing service mesh architectures, load balancing, and distributed system scenarios, it provides configurable response payloads, upstream request chaining, and controllable latency/error injection. The service supports parallel worker configurations for upstream calls, CORS handling, and includes a web UI for browser-based testing. Primary users are DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and backend developers who need to validate service-to-service communication patterns, test network policies, and simulate complex microservice topologies without deploying full application stacks. It addresses the critical need for lightweight, protocol-agnostic service mocking in containerized environments and service mesh testing scenarios.
