Webpack is a JavaScript module bundler and build tool designed for web development that transforms and packages multiple JavaScript modules, assets, and resources into optimized bundles for browser deployment. It supports various module systems including ES6 modules, CommonJS, and AMD, while providing code splitting capabilities for on-demand loading and performance optimization. The tool features a extensible plugin architecture and loader system that enables preprocessing of diverse file types including TypeScript, CSS, images, and other web assets during the compilation process. Webpack primarily serves front-end developers and web application teams who need to manage complex dependency graphs, optimize bundle sizes, and streamline the build process for modern JavaScript applications, solving the critical problem of efficiently delivering modular code to browsers.
