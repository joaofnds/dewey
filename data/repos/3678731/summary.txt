Webpack is a JavaScript module bundler designed for packaging JavaScript files for web browsers, though it supports various asset types. Its core functionality includes bundling ES Modules, CommonJS, and AMD modules, code splitting for asynchronous loading, and the ability to preprocess files using loaders for transformations like TypeScript-to-JavaScript or CSS processing. This project enables developers to create optimized web applications by resolving dependencies, providing a plugin system for extensibility, and supporting diverse module formats and file types. It is a build tool, primarily used by frontend developers to enhance web performance and manage JavaScript module dependencies.
