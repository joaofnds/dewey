Moment.js is a JavaScript date manipulation library designed for web developers working with temporal data in browser and Node.js environments. The library provides a comprehensive API for parsing date strings from various formats, validating date inputs, performing date arithmetic operations (adding/subtracting time units), and formatting dates for display across different locales and timezones. Built primarily for frontend and full-stack JavaScript developers, it addresses the complexity and inconsistencies of JavaScript's native Date object by offering an immutable, chainable interface for common date operations. The project is currently in maintenance mode as a legacy solution, with modern alternatives recommended for new development projects due to bundle size and performance considerations.
