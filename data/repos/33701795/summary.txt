Tickeys is a standalone macOS application providing real-time audio feedback for typing. Built in Rust, it enhances user interaction by playing sound effects for key presses. Users can install Tickeys via Homebrew or by downloading a DMG, and further customize the experience by adding custom sound schemes through configuration files and WAV audio files. The project serves as a demo for learning Rust and utilizes libraries like `alut` and `openssl` for development, and the code is licensed under MIT.
