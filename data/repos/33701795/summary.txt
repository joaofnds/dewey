Tickeys is a macOS desktop utility application built in Rust that provides real-time audio feedback for keyboard typing events. The application serves the productivity and user experience enhancement domain by monitoring global keyboard input and playing customizable sound effects for different keystrokes. It implements low-level system event monitoring using macOS APIs to capture typing activity across all applications, with configurable audio schemes including typewriter, mechanical keyboard, and drum sounds. The project demonstrates Rust systems programming for native macOS development, utilizing audio libraries (ALUT/OpenAL) and system-level event handling. Target users include developers, writers, and general computer users seeking enhanced typing feedback and auditory customization for their workflow, with features like application whitelisting/blacklisting and custom sound scheme creation through JSON configuration files.
