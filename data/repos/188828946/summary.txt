`endoflife.date` is a Ruby-based web application and API providing up-to-date end-of-life (EoL) dates and support lifecycles for various software products and technologies. It aggregates and presents this often-difficult-to-track information in an accessible format, leveraging Jekyll for static site generation and offering an API for CI integration.  The project features an OpenAPI/API documentation (currently in Beta) and is powered by several components including Ruby, GitHub, and Netlify, aiming to aid developers and system administrators needing to track product lifecycle information. The repository functions as a standalone web application, with a focus on providing curated data and related documentation.
