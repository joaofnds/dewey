endoflife.date is a Jekyll-based static site generator that provides a centralized database of end-of-life (EOL) dates and support lifecycle information for various software products, operating systems, and technologies. Built with Ruby and deployed on Netlify, it serves DevOps engineers, system administrators, and software developers who need to track maintenance schedules and security support windows for their technology stacks. The platform aggregates EOL data for products ranging from Linux distributions (Alpine, Ubuntu, RHEL) to programming languages (Python, PHP, Java), databases (PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Redis), and frameworks (Django, Laravel, Symfony). It exposes this information through both a web interface and a REST API, enabling integration with CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure management tools to automate dependency lifecycle monitoring and maintenance planning.
