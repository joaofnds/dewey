Vale is a command-line prose linter built in Go that applies code-style quality checks to written content across multiple markup formats including Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, HTML, and XML. Targeting technical writers, documentation teams, and content creators in software development environments, it enforces customizable style guides and spelling rules through YAML-based configurations while intelligently parsing markup syntax to avoid false positives in code blocks. The tool addresses the gap between traditional grammar checkers and developer workflows by providing extensible, automated prose validation that integrates into CI/CD pipelines, supporting both standard editorial style guides and custom organizational writing standards for technical documentation, README files, and developer-facing content.
