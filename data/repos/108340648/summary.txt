Baton is a Go-based command-line interface (CLI) and terminal user interface (TUI) tool for controlling Spotify playback through the Spotify Web API. Built using the Cobra CLI framework and Gocui for terminal interface components, it provides developers and power users with programmatic control over music playback, including track navigation, volume control, device management, playlist access, and search functionality. The tool requires Spotify Premium for full playback control due to API limitations and implements OAuth authentication with long-lasting refresh tokens. Targeting musicians, developers, and terminal-focused users who prefer command-line workflows, Baton bridges the gap between Spotify's web-based interface and automation/scripting needs in multimedia and entertainment technology domains.
