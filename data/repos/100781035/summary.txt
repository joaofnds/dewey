webview is a minimal cross-platform C/C++ library that enables native desktop application development using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) as the user interface layer. It provides a thin wrapper around platform-specific webview components: WebKitGTK on Linux, WebKit on macOS, and Microsoft's WebView2 on Windows. The library implements bidirectional JavaScript-to-C++ bindings, allowing seamless communication between web frontend code and native backend logic. Designed as a single-header library with C++11 compatibility, it targets C/C++ developers building cross-platform GUI applications who want to leverage modern web UI frameworks while maintaining native performance and system integration. The library solves the challenge of creating consistent, modern user interfaces across desktop platforms without requiring separate platform-specific GUI toolkit expertise, making it particularly valuable for developers familiar with web technologies seeking to create native desktop applications.
