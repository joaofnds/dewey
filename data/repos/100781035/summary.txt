`webview/webview` is a cross-platform C/C++ library providing a lightweight webview component for building modern GUI applications. It enables the creation of cross-platform GUIs by abstracting the underlying HTML5 UI implementations, supporting two-way JavaScript bindings for communication between C/C++ and JavaScript.  The library leverages platform-specific webview technologies, including WebKit (GTK/Cocoa) and Edge WebView2 (Windows), and is designed for developers seeking to create native applications with a web-based user interface. This is a library, incorporating examples and build instructions for integration into projects using CMake and other build systems.
