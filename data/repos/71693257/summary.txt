This repository provides a collection of IBM-originated monospaced bitmap fonts converted to BDF (Bitmap Distribution Format) 2.1 format for Unix/Linux systems. Targeting system administrators, terminal users, and retro computing enthusiasts, it preserves classic IBM BIOS and CGA text-mode fonts with comprehensive Unicode support including extended Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Hebrew scripts (750 glyphs each). The fonts are compatible with X11 font systems (Xft/XLFD), include build automation via configure scripts and Makefiles for compilation to PCF format, and integrate with standard Linux font management tools (fontconfig, fc-cache, mkfontdir). Primary use cases include terminal emulators, text editors, and applications requiring pixel-perfect monospaced fonts that replicate the aesthetic of vintage IBM computer systems.
