Biome is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a comprehensive interface to the Open Meteo weather API service within the Emacs text editor environment. Built for Emacs users and developers who need integrated weather data access, it enables querying weather forecasts, historical data, and climate projections directly from their development workspace. The package implements a tabulated interface using Emacs' built-in `tabulated-list` functionality, supports multiple query types including hourly/daily forecasts, handles geocoding for location selection, and provides CSV export capabilities. It addresses the workflow integration needs of developers, researchers, and data analysts who work primarily in Emacs and require seamless access to meteorological data without context switching to external applications or web interfaces.
