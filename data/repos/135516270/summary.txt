K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution designed for resource-constrained environments and edge computing scenarios. Built in Go, it packages a fully conformant Kubernetes cluster into a single binary under 100MB, targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers deploying containerized workloads on IoT devices, ARM systems, CI/CD pipelines, and development environments. The distribution bundles essential Kubernetes components including containerd runtime, Flannel CNI, CoreDNS, Traefik ingress controller, and replaces etcd with SQLite3 by default while supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB backends. K3s eliminates complex cluster setup procedures, reduces memory footprint by half compared to standard Kubernetes, and maintains upstream compatibility without forking core functionality, making container orchestration accessible for edge computing, embedded systems, and scenarios where full Kubernetes complexity is impractical.
