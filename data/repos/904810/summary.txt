`paranoia` is a Ruby library providing soft-deletion functionality for ActiveRecord models in Rails 5, 6, and 7 applications. It allows developers to "hide" rather than permanently destroy database records by setting a `deleted_at` timestamp, enabling data preservation and retrieval. Core features include methods for destroying (`destroy`, `really_destroy!`), restoring (`restore`), and querying soft-deleted records (`with_deleted`, `only_deleted`), as well as support for association management, index adaptation, and custom callbacks. This is a Ruby gem, intended for Ruby on Rails developers building web applications who need to implement soft-delete functionality.
