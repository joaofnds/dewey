Paranoia is a Ruby gem that implements soft deletion for Rails applications (versions 3-7), providing an alternative to hard deletion of database records. It functions as a reimplementation of acts_as_paranoid, allowing ActiveRecord models to mark records as deleted by setting a `deleted_at` timestamp rather than physically removing them from the database. The gem overrides Rails' standard `destroy` method to perform soft deletes while providing scoping methods like `with_deleted`, `only_deleted`, and `without_deleted` for querying. It includes restoration capabilities and handles cascading soft deletes through associations. Targeted at Rails developers building web applications that require data retention, audit trails, or undo functionality, Paranoia addresses the common need to preserve deleted records for compliance, recovery, or historical purposes while maintaining standard ActiveRecord interfaces.
