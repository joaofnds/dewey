pspy is a Go-based Linux process monitoring tool designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and CTF participants to perform unprivileged process enumeration on target systems. The tool leverages procfs scanning combined with inotify filesystem watchers to detect and capture short-lived processes, cron jobs, and command-line arguments executed by other users without requiring root privileges. Built as a statically-compiled binary for portability across Linux distributions, pspy monitors filesystem events in critical directories (/usr, /tmp, /etc, /home, /var, /opt) to trigger process discovery scans, making it valuable for privilege escalation reconnaissance, security auditing, and demonstrating command-line argument security vulnerabilities. The tool serves the penetration testing and security research community by enabling process snooping capabilities that traditionally require elevated permissions.
