`pspy` is a command-line tool written in Go designed for unprivileged Linux process monitoring. It enables users to observe processes, including commands and file system events, without root access. The tool achieves this by leveraging `procfs` scans triggered by `inotify` watchers on specific file system locations. Primarily used in penetration testing and CTF environments for system enumeration and privilege escalation analysis, `pspy` offers features such as colored output, configurable scan intervals, and the ability to filter watched directories.
