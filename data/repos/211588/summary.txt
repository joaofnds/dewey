PaperTrail is a Ruby gem that provides comprehensive audit logging and versioning capabilities for ActiveRecord models in Rails applications. It automatically tracks all changes (create, update, delete) to database records, storing historical versions that enable developers to revert models to previous states, restore deleted records, and maintain complete audit trails for compliance and debugging purposes. The gem integrates seamlessly with Rails' ActiveRecord ORM, supporting features like metadata storage, selective attribute monitoring, association tracking, and custom serialization. Targeted at Ruby on Rails developers building enterprise applications requiring data auditing, regulatory compliance, or version control functionality, PaperTrail solves the complex problem of maintaining historical data integrity and change tracking without requiring extensive custom implementation of audit logging systems.
