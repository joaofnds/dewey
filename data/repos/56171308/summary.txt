`logidze` is a Ruby library designed to provide database change logging and versioning for Rails applications utilizing PostgreSQL. It facilitates tracking database record modifications through DB-level triggers, storing change history within a JSONB column in the record itself, thereby eliminating the need for separate history tables. Key features include an API for accessing record versions at specific times, diff retrieval, version switching, meta-information and responsibility tracking, and optional support for associations versioning, alongside utilities for handling large logs, and record deletion concerns. This library leverages ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, and potentially the `fx` gem for schema management, targeting Rails developers seeking a performant and integrated solution for data versioning. It is a Ruby library/gem, intended for backend Rails development.
