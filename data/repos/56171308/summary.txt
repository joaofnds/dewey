Logidze is a PostgreSQL-specific database auditing and versioning library for Ruby on Rails applications that provides change tracking capabilities for ActiveRecord models. Unlike traditional audit gems that use separate tables, Logidze stores the complete version history directly within each record as JSONB data, leveraging PostgreSQL triggers for database-level logging. It targets Rails developers building web applications who need to track data changes, implement undo functionality, or maintain audit trails for compliance purposes. The library integrates seamlessly with Rails migrations, supports selective column tracking, provides time-travel queries through a Ruby API, and offers superior performance compared to alternatives like PaperTrail and Audited by eliminating additional table joins. It requires PostgreSQL 10+, Rails 6+, and Ruby 2.7+ to function.
