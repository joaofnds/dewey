RxGo is a Go implementation of ReactiveX (Rx) that provides reactive programming capabilities for asynchronous stream processing and event handling. Built on Go's native concurrency primitives (channels and goroutines), it implements the Observable pattern through a pipeline-based architecture where operators transform data streams sequentially or in parallel. The library targets Go developers building concurrent, event-driven applications that require complex asynchronous data flow management, such as real-time systems, streaming data processors, and reactive microservices. RxGo offers operators for filtering, mapping, and combining data streams while leveraging Go's goroutine model for parallel processing, providing an alternative to traditional callback-based or promise-based asynchronous programming patterns in distributed systems and high-throughput applications.
