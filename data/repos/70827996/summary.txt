RxGo is a Go language implementation of Reactive Extensions (Rx), designed for asynchronous and concurrent programming with observable streams. This library provides a comprehensive set of operators for transforming, filtering, combining, and handling errors in data streams, leveraging Go's concurrency primitives like channels and goroutines. Key features include support for hot and cold observables, backpressure strategies, and various observable types (Observable, Single, and Optional Single), enabling developers to build reactive systems. It functions as a library and targets Go developers seeking to implement reactive programming patterns.
