DataScript is an immutable in-memory database and Datalog query engine implemented in Clojure and ClojureScript for client-side web applications. It targets frontend web developers building browser-based applications that need centralized state management with complex querying capabilities. The database uses persistent data structures similar to hashmaps, providing indexed lookups and array iteration for queries without traditional database overhead. DataScript solves the problem of managing complex application state in single-page applications by offering immutable data structures, time-travel debugging, consistent rendering, and Datalog queries for non-trivial state interrogation. It's designed as a lightweight building block for ClojureScript developers who need structured state tracking, undo/redo functionality, and decoupled component architecture in browser environments.
