DataScript is a Clojure/ClojureScript library providing an immutable, in-memory database and Datalog query engine optimized for client-side applications, especially within web browsers. It functions as a lightweight, ephemeral database, enabling efficient management of application state and Datalog-based querying. Key features include immutable data structures, efficient lookups, support for multi-valued attributes, and a query engine offering implicit joins, parameterized queries, and aggregates. This library is intended to serve as a foundational building block, providing a central, uniform approach to managing application state in frontend web applications.
