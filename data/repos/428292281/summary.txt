IOPaint is a Python-based computer vision tool for AI-powered image inpainting and outpainting tasks, targeting digital image editing and content creation workflows. Built on PyTorch, it integrates state-of-the-art models including LaMa, Stable Diffusion, MAT, and ZITS for object removal, replacement, and image extension. The tool provides both a web UI and CLI interface for batch processing, supporting CUDA/CPU inference across multiple model architectures. Key features include background removal, super-resolution plugins (RealESRGAN, GFPGAN), interactive segmentation via Segment Anything, and text overlay capabilities. Primary users include content creators, photographers, and developers requiring automated image manipulation capabilities, with comprehensive model management and plugin architecture for extensible computer vision workflows.
