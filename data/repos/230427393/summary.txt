Mathpix.el is an Emacs plugin that integrates with the Mathpix OCR API to convert mathematical expressions from screenshots into LaTeX markup. Built in Emacs Lisp, it provides a screenshot-to-LaTeX workflow within the Emacs ecosystem, particularly targeting org-mode and LaTeX document authoring. The package requires Mathpix API credentials and enables users to capture mathematical notation from images and automatically insert the corresponding LaTeX code into their documents. This tool primarily serves academic researchers, mathematicians, and technical writers who work extensively with mathematical content in Emacs, streamlining the process of digitizing handwritten or printed mathematical expressions into properly formatted LaTeX code for academic papers, notes, and documentation.
