`dark-mode-notify` is a standalone command-line application written in Swift designed to execute a user-defined script upon macOS dark mode state changes. It detects changes between dark and light modes and triggers the specified command accordingly, setting the `DARKMODE` environment variable to either `1` or `0`. Users compile and run the program directly or install it as a background agent via `launchctl`, allowing for automated customization of applications like text editors based on the system's color scheme.
