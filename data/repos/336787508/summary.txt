This Swift utility monitors macOS system appearance changes and executes user-defined scripts when the system switches between dark and light modes. Built for macOS automation and developer workflow optimization, it leverages macOS's native appearance notification system to trigger external commands with a `DARKMODE` environment variable indicating the current state. The tool targets developers and system administrators who need to synchronize their development environment configurations (such as terminal themes, editor color schemes, or desktop customization scripts) with the system's appearance mode. It can run as a foreground process or be configured as a persistent background service using macOS's launchd system, making it particularly useful for maintaining consistent visual environments across development tools without manual intervention.
