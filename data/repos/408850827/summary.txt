Mocktail is a Ruby mocking library specifically designed for test-driven development, providing mock objects and test doubles for unit testing in Ruby applications. Built leveraging modern Ruby 3 APIs, it uniquely offers first-class integration with Sorbet type checking, enabling type-safe mock generation and verification. The library targets Ruby developers working on web applications, APIs, and other Ruby-based software systems who need to isolate dependencies during testing. Mocktail addresses common issues in Ruby testing frameworks by preventing brittle test configurations and reducing test coupling through improved mock object management. It serves as an alternative to traditional Ruby mocking libraries like RSpec's built-in mocks or Mocha, with enhanced support for static type analysis and modern Ruby language features.
