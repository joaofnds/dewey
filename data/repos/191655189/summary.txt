`ent/ent` is a Go-based entity framework designed to simplify building and maintaining applications with complex data models. It allows users to model database schemas as Go objects, providing a statically typed and explicit API with code generation. Key features include the ability to traverse graph structures easily, support for multiple storage drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.), and extensibility via Go templates. This project is a library/framework intended for Go developers to improve their database interactions within their applications.
