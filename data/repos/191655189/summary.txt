Ent is a code-generation-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and entity framework for Go that enables developers to model database schemas as Go structs and generate type-safe database access code. Targeting backend web development and data-intensive applications, it supports multiple database drivers including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, CockroachDB, and graph databases like Gremlin. The framework uses a "schema as code" approach where developers define entity schemas in Go, then generate statically-typed clients, queries, and migrations through code generation. It solves the problem of maintaining large, complex data models in Go applications by providing automatic query builders, relationship traversal, and database-agnostic abstractions. Primary users are Go backend developers building applications with substantial database interactions who need type safety and code maintainability.
