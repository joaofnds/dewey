`ko` is a Go-based standalone application and a container image builder designed for simplifying the build and deployment of Go applications, particularly within containerized environments like Kubernetes. It streamlines the image creation process by executing `go build` locally, removing the need for a local Docker daemon and facilitating multi-platform builds. Key features include SBOM generation and support for simple YAML templating, making it suitable for lightweight CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes application deployments. This tool is intended for Go developers working with containerized applications.
