`ko` is a container image builder specifically designed for Go applications that eliminates the need for Docker during the build process. Targeting the DevOps and cloud-native development domain, it executes `go build` locally to create container images optimized for single-binary Go applications with minimal OS dependencies. The tool integrates deeply with Kubernetes workflows, supporting multi-platform builds, automatic SBOM generation, and YAML templating for Kubernetes manifests. Built for Go developers and platform engineers working in containerized environments, `ko` addresses the complexity of traditional Docker-based build pipelines by providing a lightweight, fast alternative for CI/CD systems. It particularly excels in cloud-native applications where Go microservices need rapid containerization and deployment to Kubernetes clusters without the overhead of managing Dockerfiles or Docker daemon dependencies.
