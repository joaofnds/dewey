Puma is a high-performance HTTP/1.1 web server specifically designed for Ruby applications that implement the Rack specification. Built for the web development domain, it addresses Ruby's concurrency limitations through multi-threaded request handling and multi-process cluster mode with fork-based worker processes. The server integrates seamlessly with popular Ruby frameworks like Rails (as the default server) and Sinatra, while supporting SSL termination, zero-downtime deployments, and configurable thread pools. Puma optimizes Ruby web application performance by enabling parallel I/O operations even under MRI's Global VM Lock, and provides true parallelism on JRuby and TruffleRuby implementations. It targets Ruby web developers and DevOps engineers who need a production-ready server capable of handling concurrent requests efficiently while maintaining low memory footprint through copy-on-write memory management.
