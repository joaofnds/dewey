BubbleZone is a Go utility library that enhances mouse event handling in terminal user interfaces (TUIs) built with the BubbleTea framework and Lipgloss styling library. It solves the complex problem of mouse event tracking and component interaction in multi-component CLI applications by implementing an invisible zone marking system that wraps UI components with zero-width identifiers. The library scans rendered output to map component positions and provides simple APIs for determining if mouse events occur within specific zones, enabling features like clickable buttons, focusable elements, and hover interactions. Designed for Go developers building sophisticated command-line tools and terminal applications, it abstracts away coordinate calculations and event delegation complexity while maintaining performance and compatibility with existing Lipgloss width calculations and styling systems.
