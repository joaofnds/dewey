`bubblezone` is a Go library providing a utility for tracking mouse events within BubbleTea-based terminal user interfaces (TUIs). Its core functionality centers on simplifying mouse interaction within complex TUI layouts built with BubbleTea and lipgloss, allowing developers to easily identify clicked components and track mouse movements within defined zones. The library uses zero-printable-width identifiers to wrap UI elements, enabling accurate zone-based event handling without impacting width calculations, with features including zone identification and relative mouse position retrieval.  `bubblezone` is a library, specifically a developer tool, designed to enhance the interactivity of CLI applications built using BubbleTea.
