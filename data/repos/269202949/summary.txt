ContainerSSH is a specialized SSH server written in Go that dynamically launches ephemeral containers in Docker and Kubernetes backends upon SSH connection. It serves the DevOps and security domains by providing isolated, on-demand containerized environments for users connecting via SSH protocol. The system integrates with authentication and configuration servers through webhooks, enabling fine-grained access control and dynamic container provisioning. Primary use cases include building ephemeral lab environments, providing secure production debugging access with audit logging, and creating honeypots for security research. It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and security professionals who need to provide temporary, isolated SSH access without persistent infrastructure, replacing traditional SSH servers with container-based isolation and automatic cleanup capabilities.
