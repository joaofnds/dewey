ContainerSSH is an SSH server written in Go designed to dynamically launch containers on demand, primarily targeting DevOps and security use cases. It allows users to securely access containers through SSH, providing features like authentication, configuration via webhooks, and audit logging. Key functionalities include building lab environments, debugging production systems by granting controlled developer access, and running honeypots to analyze SSH attack patterns. This project is a standalone application that leverages Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration and integrates with authentication and configuration servers for extended functionality.
