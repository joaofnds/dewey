Killersheep is a demonstration game plugin for Vim 8.2 that showcases advanced editor features including popup windows with color masking, text properties for syntax highlighting, and audio playback capabilities. Built entirely in Vim Script, this arcade-style shooter game serves as a technical showcase for Vim plugin developers and advanced users to explore the editor's graphical and interactive capabilities beyond traditional text editing. The plugin requires specific Vim features (+textprop, +sound) and external audio commands (afplay, paplay, or cvlc) for full functionality, targeting terminal environments with minimum 45-line display capacity. It addresses the developer tools and editor customization domain by demonstrating how modern Vim versions can support interactive applications while providing entertainment value for Vim enthusiasts and plugin developers interested in leveraging the editor's extended feature set.
