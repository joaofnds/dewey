`dot-prop` is a JavaScript utility library for web development that provides programmatic access to nested object properties using dot notation string paths. It offers four core functions (`getProperty`, `setProperty`, `hasProperty`, `deleteProperty`) that enable developers to safely traverse and manipulate deeply nested JavaScript objects and arrays without manual property checking or complex bracket notation. The library supports advanced features like escaped dot characters for literal dots in property names, array index notation (`foo[0].bar`), default value fallbacks, and path enumeration via `deepKeys`. Targeting JavaScript/Node.js developers working with complex data structures, APIs, or configuration objects, it solves the common problem of safely accessing nested properties that may not exist, eliminating verbose conditional checks and reducing runtime errors in modern web applications.
