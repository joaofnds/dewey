gleam-lang/cowboy is an HTTP service adapter that bridges Gleam applications with the Cowboy web server, enabling Gleam developers to build web services on the Erlang/OTP platform. This library provides a type-safe interface for handling HTTP requests and responses, converting between Gleam's HTTP types and Cowboy's native Erlang implementation. Targeted at web developers building backend services and APIs in the functional programming ecosystem, it solves the integration challenge between Gleam's modern syntax and Erlang's mature web infrastructure. The adapter handles HTTP routing, request processing, and response formatting while maintaining Gleam's type safety guarantees, though it has limitations with duplicate HTTP headers and is positioned as an alternative to the newer Mist web server.
