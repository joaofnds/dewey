`gleam-lang/cowboy` is a Gleam library providing an HTTP service adapter for the Cowboy web server, facilitating the creation of HTTP services. It enables users to define Gleam-based HTTP services that can be exposed via Cowboy's architecture, allowing for the handling of HTTP requests and generating responses. The library utilizes the Gleam programming language and depends on the Erlang-based Cowboy web server, with core functionalities including request handling and response generation capabilities. This project serves as a library for Gleam developers building web applications.
