Filestash is a web-based file manager that provides a unified interface for accessing heterogeneous storage backends including SFTP, S3, FTP, WebDAV, Git, SMB, NFS, and cloud providers like Dropbox and Google Drive. Built with JavaScript frontend and Go backend, it implements a plugin-based architecture around a standardized IBackend interface that abstracts storage operations (list, read, write, delete). The system targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and organizations needing centralized file management across multiple protocols and storage systems. It includes media transcoding, office document viewing, authentication middleware, and sharing capabilities. The modular design allows customization through plugins for authorization, search functionality, and file type handling, making it suitable for building purpose-built file management solutions in enterprise environments.
