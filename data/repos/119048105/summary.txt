`fselect` is a command-line utility written in Rust designed to find files based on SQL-like queries against the filesystem, offering an alternative to traditional `find`. Key features include SQL-like query syntax with support for complex expressions, aggregate functions, date/time manipulation, and searching within archives and by various metadata (image dimensions, EXIF, MP3 info, file hashes). The application supports diverse output formats and provides features like interactive mode and integration with `.gitignore` and `.hgignore`. This project is a standalone CLI tool aimed at system administrators and developers for enhanced file searching capabilities.
