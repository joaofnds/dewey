**fselect** is a command-line filesystem utility written in Rust that enables file searching and analysis using SQL-like query syntax. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and power users, it serves as an advanced alternative to traditional Unix `find` and `ls` commands for complex file operations. The tool provides comprehensive file metadata querying capabilities including EXIF data extraction, MP3 tag analysis, file hash computation, MIME type detection, and archive content inspection. It supports aggregate functions, regular expressions, date/time operations, and multiple output formats (CSV, JSON). The core problem addressed is the limitation of traditional file search tools when performing complex queries that require multiple criteria, statistical analysis, or structured data output, making it particularly valuable for system auditing, forensics, and automated file management workflows.
