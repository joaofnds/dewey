esbuild is a high-performance JavaScript bundler and build tool written in Go, designed for modern web development workflows. It compiles, bundles, and minifies JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX, and CSS files with native support for both ESM and CommonJS module systems. The tool addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing web build tools by leveraging Go's concurrency and speed, achieving 10-100x faster build times compared to Node.js-based alternatives like Webpack or Rollup. Target users are frontend developers and web development teams who need rapid compilation and bundling for React, TypeScript, and modern JavaScript applications. Key features include tree shaking, source map generation, CSS modules support, development server capabilities, and extensibility through a plugin system, all accessible via CLI, JavaScript, or Go APIs.
