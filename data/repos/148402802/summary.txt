Phoenix LiveView is an Elixir-based web framework component that enables real-time, interactive web applications using server-rendered HTML over WebSockets. Built for the Phoenix framework ecosystem, it allows web developers to create dynamic user interfaces without writing client-side JavaScript by maintaining application state on the server and sending minimal HTML diffs to the browser. The framework targets full-stack web developers building interactive applications like dashboards, chat systems, and collaborative tools, providing features such as live form validation, file uploads, optimistic updates, and declarative rendering through the HEEx templating language. LiveView solves the complexity of coordinating client-server state synchronization while maintaining the performance benefits of server-side rendering and real-time updates.
