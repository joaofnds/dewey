`emacs-buttercup` is an Emacs Lisp testing framework designed for behavior-driven development. It enables developers to write tests with shared setup/teardown code and function "spies" for argument validation, facilitating easier testing of Emacs Lisp code. Key features include an `expect` macro, a mocking framework, and support for continuous integration environments with built-in test runners. This library provides an alternative to Emacs' built-in ERT testing framework, offering improved features for grouping tests and managing test dependencies. The project type is a testing framework/library intended for Emacs Lisp developers.
