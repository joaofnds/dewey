Buttercup is a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework specifically designed for Emacs Lisp development, targeting Emacs package developers and Elisp programmers who need robust testing capabilities. Inspired by the Jasmine JavaScript testing framework, it provides structured test organization through describe/it blocks, shared setup/teardown functionality, an extensible expect assertion system, and a comprehensive mocking framework called "spies" for function stubbing and verification. The framework addresses limitations of Emacs' built-in ERT testing system by offering better test organization, simplified fixture management, and CI-friendly test runners with automatic test discovery, making it particularly valuable for maintainers of Emacs packages and extensions who require professional-grade testing tools in the Emacs ecosystem.
