**smenu** is a C-based terminal selection filter and CLI tool that reads input from stdin or files and presents selectable options in scrollable terminal windows with keyboard/mouse navigation. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and shell scripters, it serves as an interactive selection interface for command-line workflows, replacing tools like grep with visual selection capabilities. Built using terminfo libraries with UTF-8 support including double-width characters, it integrates into shell scripts, bash history replacement (CTRL-R alternative), and Unix pipeline operations. The tool addresses the need for interactive terminal-based selection in automation scripts, system administration tasks, and command-line productivity workflows, functioning as a "sed for selection" that maintains terminal state without screen clearing.
