`json-snatcher` is an Emacs Lisp extension designed to extract the path to a specific JSON element within a JSON file opened in Emacs. It provides a hotkey (`C-c C-g`) binding for JSON files in `js-mode` and `js2-mode` to facilitate path retrieval. The extension is available via MELPA and is implemented entirely in Emacs Lisp. This tool is a developer productivity plugin primarily targeted at Emacs users working with JSON data.
