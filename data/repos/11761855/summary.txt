json-snatcher is an Emacs Lisp extension that extracts JSON path expressions for programmatic access to specific elements within JSON files. Designed for web developers and data engineers working with large JSON datasets, it allows users to position their cursor on any JSON value and automatically generate the complete path notation needed to access that element programmatically. The tool integrates with Emacs' js-mode and js2-mode, providing keyboard shortcuts (C-c C-g) for instant path generation. This addresses the common development workflow challenge of manually constructing JSON paths when parsing complex nested data structures for APIs, configuration files, or data processing tasks, eliminating the tedious and error-prone process of manually tracing object hierarchies.
