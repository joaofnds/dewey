BunRouter is a high-performance HTTP router library for Go web development that provides a net/http-compatible API while addressing limitations of existing routing solutions. It combines the speed of httprouter with advanced features including middleware support, centralized error handling, and intelligent route priority matching (static > named > wildcard). The router targets Go backend developers building REST APIs and web services who need efficient request routing without heavyweight frameworks like Gin or Echo. Key technical advantages include zero memory allocations for parameter extraction, seamless integration with standard library HTTP handlers, and support for complex routing patterns with predictable matching behavior. The library serves as a lightweight alternative to full-featured web frameworks while maintaining compatibility with existing Go HTTP tooling and middleware ecosystems.
