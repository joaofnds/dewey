The `wolfi-dev/os` repository houses the main package repository for the Wolfi project, a lightweight GNU software distribution designed for containerized environments. Built using `melange`, it provides a curated set of packages managed by the `apk` package manager, intended for minimal and up-to-date container image creation. It is a core component of the Wolfi Linux distribution and a crucial resource for building and deploying containerized applications, specifically targeting developers and system administrators working within container-based workflows. The project is primarily written in Shell and leverages the `apko` tool.
