**Wolfi** is a lightweight GNU/Linux distribution specifically engineered for containerized environments and embedded systems, targeting DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and container infrastructure teams. Built using **melange** (package builder) and **apko** (container image assembler), it provides a minimal APK-based package ecosystem optimized for security-conscious container workloads. The repository contains package definitions and build configurations for creating distroless and minimal container base images, addressing the need for reduced attack surface and smaller image sizes in cloud-native deployments. Unlike general-purpose distributions, Wolfi focuses exclusively on packages required for containerized workflows, maintaining up-to-date security patches while ensuring compatibility with modern container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.
