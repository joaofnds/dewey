SICL is a new implementation of Common Lisp, designed for modularity and portability across various Lisp environments. It provides a complete Common Lisp environment, broken into implementation-independent modules that are designed to be incorporated into other Lisp implementations. Built primarily using the TeX markup language for documentation, SICL depends on a suite of related projects, including Clonedijk, Concrete-Syntax-Tree, ctype, Eclector, and several more, showcasing a complex dependency structure for supporting its functionalities and intended for Common Lisp developers and users. It is a project that aims to provide a new and improved foundational implementation of the Common Lisp language.
