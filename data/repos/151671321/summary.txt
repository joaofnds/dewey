This repository provides an illustrated explanation of the TLS 1.2 protocol by demonstrating a simplified client and server implementation written in Go. The project features a server and client application, alongside packet capture (PCAP) and keylog files, enabling users to understand TLS 1.2 connection establishment by examining the byte-level interactions. It leverages the Go programming language and includes a modified version of Go's `crypto/tls` library for debugging. Primarily an educational project, it serves as a hands-on resource for understanding the TLS 1.2 standard, targeting developers and security researchers interested in network protocols and cryptographic implementations.
