This repository is an educational resource that provides a byte-by-byte analysis of TLS 1.2 protocol handshakes, implementing a custom Go client-server pair to demonstrate cryptographic operations including ECDHE key exchange, RSA authentication, and AES-CBC encryption. The project serves cybersecurity professionals, network engineers, and developers who need to understand TLS internals by capturing real network traffic (PCAP files) and correlating it with detailed explanations of each protocol step. It includes a modified copy of Go's crypto/tls library to extract normally-hidden cryptographic secrets and session keys, enabling complete decryption and analysis of the SSL/TLS connection establishment process. The accompanying website provides comprehensive documentation explaining elliptic curve cryptography, certificate validation, and symmetric encryption implementation details for educational and debugging purposes.
