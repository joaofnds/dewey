The `keycodes` repository is a web-based developer tool for JavaScript/TypeScript developers working with keyboard event handling. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, it provides an interactive KeyCode visualizer that captures keyboard inputs and displays the corresponding JavaScript KeyboardEvent properties, including key codes and key values. The application serves as a reference utility for front-end developers who need to quickly identify JavaScript keyboard event codes for implementing keyboard shortcuts, form controls, or interactive web applications. Deployed as a simple static website, it solves the common developer problem of having to look up or test specific keyboard event values during web development, particularly useful for developers working on browser-based applications requiring precise keyboard input handling.
