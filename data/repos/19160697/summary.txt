`keycodes` is a web application providing a visualizer for JavaScript key codes. Built with TypeScript and Next.js, it allows users to interactively press keys and immediately view their corresponding `key` and `keyCode` values as generated by the `KeyboardEvent`. This standalone web application is designed to be a developer productivity tool, facilitating the understanding and debugging of keyboard input handling in JavaScript. Deployment utilizes Docker for ease of use.
