`cl-gserver` is a Common Lisp framework and library providing an actor model implementation for building concurrent and reactive systems.  It enables asynchronous message passing with features like actors, agents for state management, a Finite State Machine (FSM) framework, routers for message distribution, and an event stream for pub/sub messaging. The project includes facilities for task management, futures, and uses a message dispatcher pool for efficient handling of numerous actors, making it suitable for developing applications requiring parallel computation and event-driven architectures. This is a library intended for Common Lisp developers interested in building concurrent and reactive applications.
