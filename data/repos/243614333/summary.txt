Sento (cl-gserver) is a Common Lisp actor framework implementing the actor model for concurrent and distributed systems, similar to Erlang/OTP or Akka. It provides message-passing primitives with actors supporting `ask` (synchronous/asynchronous) and `tell` (fire-and-forget) operations, agents for state management, finite state machines, load-balancing routers, event streams for pub/sub messaging, and futures for asynchronous computation. The framework targets backend developers building reactive, event-driven systems requiring high concurrency and fault tolerance, particularly in domains like automation, IoT communication protocols, and high-throughput web services. It addresses the challenge of building concurrent applications in Common Lisp by providing battle-tested actor model abstractions for managing shared state, coordinating parallel computations, and handling asynchronous message processing workflows.
