TensorFlow Playground is an interactive web-based neural network visualization tool built with TypeScript and D3.js for educational and experimentation purposes in the machine learning domain. The application provides a browser-based interface that allows users to visually construct, configure, and train neural networks in real-time, observing how different parameters, architectures, and datasets affect model behavior and decision boundaries. Targeting data scientists, ML engineers, students, and educators, it serves as a hands-on learning platform for understanding fundamental deep learning concepts without requiring local ML framework installations. The codebase implements neural network algorithms from scratch in TypeScript, leveraging D3.js for interactive data visualization and real-time rendering of training processes, making complex ML concepts accessible through visual experimentation.
