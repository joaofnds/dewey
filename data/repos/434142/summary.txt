vim-repeat is a Vim plugin that extends the native `.` (dot) command functionality to support repeating custom plugin mappings rather than just the last native command within those mappings. Built in Vim Script, it targets text editor extensibility and plugin development within the Vim ecosystem. The plugin provides a programmatic API through the `repeat#set()` function that allows other plugin developers to integrate repeatable functionality into their custom key mappings. It solves the limitation where Vim's built-in repeat command only repeats primitive editor operations instead of complex plugin-defined actions, enabling a more consistent user experience across plugin interactions. The primary users are Vim plugin developers and advanced Vim users who rely on text manipulation plugins like surround.vim, speeddating.vim, and unimpaired.vim for enhanced editing workflows in software development environments.
