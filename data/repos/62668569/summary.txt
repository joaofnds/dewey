Sol is a next-generation package manager written in C, designed to replace eopkg for the Solus Linux distribution. This system administration tool targets Linux distribution maintainers and system administrators, focusing on optimizing package installation, updates, and dependency management for rolling release distributions. The project addresses critical package management challenges including download optimization, faster update application, and maintaining system stability across ABI changes and configuration updates. Sol implements a container-based package format, abstract database layer for package metadata, and network-capable repository handling to support Solus's "install today, update forever" philosophy. The architecture includes migration systems for backward compatibility with existing eopkg installations and exposes a library interface for integration with other system management tools.
