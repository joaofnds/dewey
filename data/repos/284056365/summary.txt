**stackline** is a macOS desktop environment enhancement tool written in Lua that provides visual indicators for window stacks in the yabai tiling window manager. The project addresses the lack of built-in UI feedback for yabai's window stacking feature by integrating with Hammerspoon to display unobtrusive overlay indicators showing stack position, window count, and application icons. It targets power users and system administrators who use advanced window management workflows on macOS, particularly those employing tiling window managers for productivity optimization. The tool offers smart positioning algorithms to place indicators at screen edges, multi-monitor support, and flexible configuration options accessible via shell commands or direct Hammerspoon API integration, solving the disorientation problem that occurs when multiple windows occupy the same screen space without visual cues.
