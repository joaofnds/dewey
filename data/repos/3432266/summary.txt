The `JetBrains/kotlin` repository hosts the source code for the Kotlin programming language, a statically-typed language targeting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), JavaScript, and WebAssembly (WASM). It provides a modern alternative to Java, featuring concise syntax, null safety, and interoperability with existing Java codebases. Functionality includes a compiler, plugin support for IntelliJ IDEA and Gradle/Maven build systems, and a comprehensive standard library. This project serves as the core implementation and reference for the Kotlin programming language.
