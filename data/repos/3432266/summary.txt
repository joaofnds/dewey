The JetBrains/kotlin repository contains the complete implementation of the Kotlin programming language, including its compiler infrastructure, standard library, and toolchain ecosystem. This multiplatform language targets diverse development domains including Android mobile development, JVM backend services, JavaScript web applications, and WebAssembly. The repository encompasses the Kotlin compiler backend, Gradle build plugin, Maven integration, IntelliJ IDEA plugin, and WebAssembly support components. Built primarily for software developers across enterprise and mobile application development, Kotlin solves interoperability challenges between Java ecosystems while enabling code sharing across platforms. The project uses Gradle toolchains with JDK provisioning and integrates with JetBrains' development infrastructure, serving as the foundational codebase for one of the fastest-growing programming languages in enterprise and Android development.
