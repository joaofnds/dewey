Clasp is a Common Lisp compiler implementation that uses LLVM for native code generation and provides seamless interoperability with C++ libraries and programs. Targeting scientific computing and systems programming domains, it enables Common Lisp developers to leverage existing C++ ecosystems while maintaining Lisp's rapid prototyping and incremental development capabilities. The implementation supports standard Common Lisp tooling including SLIME, ASDF, Quicklisp, CFFI, and Bordeaux-Threads, making it compatible with the broader Lisp ecosystem. Clasp addresses the problem of integrating high-performance C++ libraries with Common Lisp environments, allowing developers to combine the expressiveness of Lisp with native performance and access to extensive C++ codebases for computational workloads.
