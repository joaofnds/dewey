Clasp is a Common Lisp implementation designed for interoperability with C++ libraries and programs, leveraging LLVM for compilation to native code. This compiler-based project provides a runtime environment for Common Lisp, enabling developers to utilize existing C++ codebases and scientific computing tools within a Lisp ecosystem. Key features include support for major Common Lisp components like SLIME, ASDF, and Quicklisp, alongside CFFI and Bordeaux-Threads. It functions as a development tool for Lisp programmers, specifically enabling integration with and access to pre-existing C++ libraries, expanding Common Lisp's capabilities and facilitating rapid prototyping.
