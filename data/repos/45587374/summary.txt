Agave is a monospace typeface project specifically designed for programming and terminal environments, targeting software developers, system administrators, and technical users who require clear character distinction in code editors and command-line interfaces. The repository contains FontForge source files (.sfd) and build scripts written in Tcl for generating TrueType font files with comprehensive Unicode coverage including ASCII, Latin extensions, Greek, Cyrillic, mathematical symbols, box-drawing characters, and Powerline glyphs. The font addresses the common problem of character ambiguity in programming contexts by providing distinct glyphs for easily confused characters like zero/O and one/l/I, offering both dotted and slashed zero variants. The build process leverages FontForge for font generation and ttfautohint for optimization, producing ready-to-use .ttf files distributed under MIT license for integration into development toolchains and terminal applications.
