**Just** is a collection of zero-dependency JavaScript utility modules designed for web developers working on Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) and bundle-size-critical projects. Each module performs a single, focused function across domains including object manipulation, array operations, statistical calculations, and string transformations. The library provides both ES modules and CommonJS compatibility with full TypeScript definitions, targeting modern JavaScript environments that support ES5+ features like spread syntax. Unlike monolithic utility libraries such as Lodash, Just allows developers to import individual functions (e.g., `just-clone`, `just-diff`, `just-merge`) to minimize bundle size while maintaining functionality for data structure manipulation, mathematical computations, and text processing tasks common in frontend JavaScript development and Node.js applications.
