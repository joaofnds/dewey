HashiCorp Waypoint is a DevOps automation tool written in Go that provides a unified workflow for building, deploying, and releasing applications across multiple platforms. It targets DevOps engineers and developers by implementing infrastructure-as-code principles for application lifecycle management. The tool integrates with containerization technologies (Docker, Cloud Native Buildpacks), orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Nomad), and cloud services (AWS ECS/EC2, Azure Container Instances, Google Cloud Run) through a plugin-based architecture. Waypoint solves the complexity of managing inconsistent deployment workflows across heterogeneous infrastructure by providing a declarative configuration approach that standardizes build, deploy, and release processes regardless of the underlying platform, reducing deployment complexity and improving repeatability in multi-cloud and hybrid environments.
