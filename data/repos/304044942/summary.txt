Galaxyline.nvim is a Lua-based statusline plugin for Neovim 0.5+ that provides a componentized, highly customizable status bar for text editors. Targeted at developers and power users in software development environments, it offers a programmatic API for creating modular statusline components including Git integration (branch, diff status), file information (size, format, encoding), LSP client status, diagnostic information, and buffer management. The plugin leverages Neovim's Lua runtime for performance optimization and integrates with popular development tools like vim-gitgutter, gitsigns, and various LSP servers. It addresses the need for fast, lightweight, and fully programmable statusline customization in modern Neovim-based development workflows, allowing developers to display relevant project and file context information efficiently.
