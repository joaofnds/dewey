This repository contains the open-source codebase for switches.mx, a comprehensive database website cataloging mechanical keyboard switches. Built using Statamic (a Laravel-based PHP CMS), the application serves as a reference platform for the mechanical keyboard enthusiast community. The system utilizes a file-based architecture storing content in YAML and Markdown files rather than traditional databases, eliminating external database dependencies. Designed for deployment via Laravel Homestead with Vagrant/VirtualBox, it targets keyboard enthusiasts, hardware reviewers, and developers interested in mechanical keyboard specifications. The platform addresses the need for centralized, searchable switch documentation in the custom keyboard community, providing detailed technical specifications and comparative data for various MX-style mechanical switches used in custom keyboard builds.
