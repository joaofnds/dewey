`kind` is a Go-based, command-line tool for creating and managing local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containerized nodes. Its primary function is to facilitate testing and development of Kubernetes, enabling users to spin up single or multi-node clusters locally. Key features include cluster creation, node image building, and integration with `kubeadm`, all built upon Go packages and Docker images designed to run systemd and Kubernetes. The project is a standalone CLI application with a target audience of Kubernetes developers and testers, offering a lightweight environment for local cluster management and CI/CD integration.
