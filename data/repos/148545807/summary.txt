kind (Kubernetes IN Docker) is a Go-based development tool that creates local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes" for testing and development purposes. Targeting the DevOps and Kubernetes ecosystem, it leverages Docker/Podman containers, kubeadm for cluster bootstrapping, and systemd to simulate multi-node Kubernetes environments on a single machine. The tool addresses the problem of requiring complex infrastructure for Kubernetes testing by providing lightweight, reproducible local clusters that support multi-node configurations, HA setups, and custom Kubernetes builds from source. Primary users include Kubernetes developers, platform engineers, and DevOps practitioners who need rapid cluster provisioning for CI/CD pipelines, local development, and Kubernetes application testing without cloud infrastructure dependencies.
