Daytona is a cloud-based sandbox infrastructure platform designed for securely executing AI-generated code in isolated environments. Built with TypeScript and Go, it provides developer tools for AI agents and agentic workflows through Python and TypeScript SDKs. The platform creates sub-90ms containerized sandboxes using OCI/Docker images, offering programmatic APIs for file operations, Git integration, Language Server Protocol (LSP), and code execution. It targets AI developers, software engineers, and DevOps teams working with AI code interpreters and automated code generation workflows who need secure, elastic infrastructure to run untrusted AI-generated code without compromising their primary systems. The solution addresses the critical security challenge of executing AI-generated code by providing persistent, isolated runtime environments with unlimited scalability for concurrent AI workflows.
