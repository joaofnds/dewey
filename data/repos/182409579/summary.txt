gameboy.live is a Game Boy emulator implemented in Go that provides multiple rendering backends for retro gaming applications. The project targets game development and emulation enthusiasts by offering both desktop GUI gameplay using the Fyne framework and innovative "cloud gaming" capabilities through terminal-based ASCII rendering via telnet servers. Key technical features include CPU emulation, graphics processing with ANSI escape codes for terminal output, WebSocket streaming for real-time game state transmission, and HTTP APIs for collaborative gameplay integration. The emulator supports standard Game Boy ROM files and implements core gaming peripherals including sound processing with ALSA on Linux systems. Primary use cases include educational emulator development, terminal-based gaming servers, and integration into web platforms like GitHub profiles for interactive demonstrations, serving developers interested in emulation programming and alternative gaming interfaces.
