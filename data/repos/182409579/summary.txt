`Gameboy.Live` is a Go-based standalone application emulating the Game Boy handheld console, enabling users to play Game Boy games both locally in a GUI and remotely via terminal-based "cloud gaming." Key functionalities include CPU instruction emulation, sound and graphics rendering, and support for various cartridge types, with a built-in debugger for ROM analysis. It features cloud gaming servers supporting both telnet access and static image streaming via HTTP and WebSockets, allowing for collaborative gameplay experiences. This project targets users interested in game emulation and cloud gaming, with developers being a secondary audience.
