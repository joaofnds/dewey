Lit is a comprehensive package management and distribution toolkit for the Luvit ecosystem, designed for Lua developers building server-side applications and libraries. It functions as both a package manager (similar to npm or pip) and a build system, enabling developers to publish, download, install dependencies, and compile Luvi applications into self-executing binaries. The toolkit connects to a central WebSocket-based repository (wss://lit.luvit.io), handles package versioning and dependency resolution, and provides CLI tools for project scaffolding, authentication via GitHub SSH keys, and offline development capabilities. Built entirely in Lua and targeting the Luvit runtime environment, Lit addresses the need for standardized package distribution and dependency management in Lua-based server applications, similar to how Node.js uses npm for JavaScript development.
