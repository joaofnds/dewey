Lit is a Lua-based package management and build toolkit designed for the Luvit ecosystem, facilitating the development, sharing, and execution of Lua programs and libraries. It functions as a command-line interface (CLI) and a library, providing capabilities such as package publishing to a central repository, dependency management for local projects, and building Luvi applications into self-executing binaries. The toolkit utilizes a Git-compatible database for internal storage, relies on websockets for its network protocol (with fallback to TLS), and exposes a REST API for browsing package content, all implemented in Lua and targeting developers working within the Luvit runtime environment.
