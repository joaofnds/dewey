This repository implements a Go circuit breaker library designed for distributed systems and microservices architecture. It provides a Hystrix-compatible implementation of the circuit breaker pattern, which prevents cascading failures by monitoring downstream service calls and temporarily blocking requests when failure rates exceed thresholds. The library targets backend developers building resilient Go applications that need to handle external service dependencies gracefully. Key features include context integration, comprehensive metrics tracking, Netflix Hystrix dashboard compatibility, SLO monitoring, and zero-allocation performance optimization. It solves the problem of service degradation caused by failing downstream dependencies by providing fast-fail behavior, fallback mechanisms, and automatic recovery detection, making it essential for microservices reliability engineering and distributed system fault tolerance.
