This repository contains open-source hardware designs for custom mechanical keyboards targeting DIY keyboard enthusiasts and makers. The project includes three distinct keyboard designs: Djinn (64-key ergonomic split keyboard with tactile switches), Ghoul (40-key development board with hot-swappable MCU capability), and Kobold (16-key ortholinear macropad). Built using KiCad for PCB design and integrated with QMK firmware framework, these designs feature modern hardware components including RGB lighting, OLED displays, rotary encoders, and SparkFun MicroMod compatibility. The repository serves hardware hackers and keyboard enthusiasts who want to build custom mechanical keyboards from scratch, providing complete PCB schematics, layouts, and manufacturing files under CERN-OHL-S open hardware license for the ergonomic keyboard and maker communities.
