This repository contains design files for custom mechanical keyboards. It features designs for split and ergonomic keyboards, including the Djinn (a 64-key split keyboard), the Ghoul (a Planck-like development board with encoder and RGB OLED support), and the Kobold (an ortho 4x4 macropad). The designs utilize technologies like KiCad for PCB design and QMK firmware. This is a hardware design project for DIY enthusiasts interested in building custom mechanical keyboards.
