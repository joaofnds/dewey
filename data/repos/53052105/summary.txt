This repository provides a collection of prototype UI components built using vanilla JavaScript and native web platform APIs, targeting web developers seeking performance-oriented interface solutions. The samples demonstrate modern ES2015+ JavaScript implementations for common UI patterns like swipeable cards and side navigation menus, emphasizing direct browser feature utilization without framework dependencies. Developed by Google Chrome Labs, these educational prototypes showcase best practices for building performant, standards-compliant web components using core DOM APIs, CSS, and modern JavaScript features. The codebase serves frontend developers and UI engineers who want to understand native web development approaches and create lightweight, framework-agnostic interface elements without relying on heavy libraries or build tools.
