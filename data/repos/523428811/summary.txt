yamlfmt is a Go-based command-line tool and library designed for automated YAML file formatting in DevOps and software development workflows. Built as a single binary for easy distribution, it provides extensible formatting capabilities through custom formatters and integrates with CI/CD pipelines, pre-commit hooks, and Docker containers. The tool addresses code quality and consistency challenges by standardizing YAML formatting across configuration files, deployment manifests, and infrastructure-as-code resources. It supports recursive directory processing, glob patterns via doublestar, and configuration through .yamlfmt files, making it suitable for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers managing Kubernetes manifests, Ansible playbooks, GitHub Actions workflows, and other YAML-based configuration systems in modern cloud-native development environments.
