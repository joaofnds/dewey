AutoMQ is a cloud-native, stateless implementation of Apache Kafka that leverages object storage (S3, Azure, GCP) as its primary storage backend instead of traditional local disks. Built in Java, it targets distributed systems and streaming data infrastructure domains by decoupling compute from storage, enabling rapid auto-scaling and multi-AZ deployments. The system maintains Kafka API compatibility while addressing cost optimization and operational complexity challenges in cloud environments. It serves system administrators, DevOps engineers, and platform teams managing large-scale message streaming workloads who need elastic, cost-effective alternatives to traditional Kafka deployments. Key technologies include Kafka protocol implementation, cloud object storage APIs, and containerized deployment orchestration for serverless-style operation.
