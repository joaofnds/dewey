AutoMQ is a Java-based, cloud-native, and serverless alternative to Apache Kafka, designed for high-throughput, low-latency streaming and messaging. It leverages object storage, such as S3 or MinIO, to achieve 10x cost savings, eliminate cross-AZ traffic, and provide autoscaling within seconds. Key features include 100% Kafka compatibility, a stateless broker architecture, built-in auto-balancing, and a rack-aware router. This project is a standalone application/platform addressing the cloud streaming data platform domain, intended for system administrators and developers looking for a cost-effective and scalable Kafka solution.
