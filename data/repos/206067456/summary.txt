`jsonbox` is an HTTP-based JSON storage service implemented in JavaScript using Node.js. It provides RESTful APIs for storing, reading, and modifying JSON data, targeting small projects, prototypes, and hackathons. Key functionalities include creating, reading, updating, and deleting JSON records via HTTP POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE requests respectively, supporting features like querying, sorting, and protected boxes with API key authentication. This repository offers the source code for a standalone web application, providing an alternative to spinning up dedicated datastores, and includes examples for interacting with the API via `curl` commands and wrappers in various languages.
