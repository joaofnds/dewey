JSONBox is an HTTP-based JSON storage service built with Node.js and MongoDB that provides RESTful APIs for storing, retrieving, and manipulating JSON data without requiring database setup. Targeting web developers working on prototypes, hackathons, and small projects, it offers CRUD operations through simple HTTP requests with features like querying, sorting, pagination, and collection grouping. The service supports filtering by numeric, string, and boolean values, implements protected boxes with API key authentication, and includes rate limiting for abuse prevention. This serverless data storage solution eliminates the need for developers to configure traditional databases during rapid development phases, making it ideal for frontend developers, prototype builders, and teams needing quick JSON persistence without infrastructure overhead.
