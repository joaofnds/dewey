React is a JavaScript library designed for building user interfaces, specifically targeting the web and native application development. It enables developers to create declarative, component-based UIs, facilitating efficient updates and rendering through a virtual DOM. Key features include JSX syntax for UI definition, server-side rendering capabilities, and support for building complex UIs from encapsulated components. This is a JavaScript library aimed at frontend developers, promoting code reusability and a "learn once, write anywhere" approach for UI development across various platforms.
