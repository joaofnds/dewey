React is a JavaScript library for building declarative user interfaces in web and mobile applications, targeting frontend developers in the web development domain. It implements a component-based architecture where UI elements are encapsulated, reusable components that manage their own state and efficiently re-render when data changes through a virtual DOM reconciliation process. The library uses JSX syntax for component templating and supports server-side rendering via Node.js and cross-platform mobile development through React Native. React solves the complexity of building interactive, dynamic user interfaces by providing predictable state management, efficient DOM updates, and a modular component system that enables developers to create scalable single-page applications and progressive web apps with improved maintainability and performance.
