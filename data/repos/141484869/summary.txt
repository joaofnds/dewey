UDS (Unlimited Drive Storage) is a Python-based file storage system that exploits Google Drive's storage quota mechanism by splitting binary files into base64-encoded chunks stored within Google Docs. The tool targets users seeking unlimited cloud storage by leveraging the fact that Google Docs traditionally didn't count against storage quotas. It uses Google Drive API v3 for file operations, implementing file fragmentation where each Google Doc stores approximately 710KB of base64-encoded data (~1 million characters). The system provides CLI operations for upload, download, list, delete, and bulk file management with progress tracking. Primary users include system administrators, power users, and developers requiring large-scale file storage solutions who want to circumvent traditional cloud storage limitations through API manipulation and data encoding techniques.
