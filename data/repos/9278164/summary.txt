vim-easy-align is a Vim text editor plugin written in Vim Script that provides automated text alignment functionality for code formatting and document editing. The plugin enables developers and text editors to align code elements like assignment operators (=), delimiters (commas, colons, pipes), and arbitrary patterns using predefined rules or regular expressions. It operates through interactive visual mode selections or command-line interfaces, supporting various alignment modes (left, right, center) and targeting specific delimiter occurrences. The tool addresses code readability and formatting consistency challenges common in software development workflows, particularly for aligning variable assignments, table-like data structures, configuration files, and multi-line code blocks. It targets Vim users including software developers, system administrators, and technical writers who require precise text manipulation and code formatting capabilities within their terminal-based editing environment.
