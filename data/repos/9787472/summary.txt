vim-anzu is a Vim plugin that enhances search functionality by displaying real-time search position information and match counts during text navigation. Built in Vim Script, it provides visual feedback showing the current match position relative to total matches (e.g., "anzu(12/51)") when using Vim's native search commands like n, N, *, and #. The plugin integrates with Vim's statusline and offers customizable key mappings for search navigation with position display. It addresses the common developer workflow issue of lacking context about search result quantity and current position when navigating through code or text files. The tool targets software developers, system administrators, and technical writers who use Vim as their primary text editor and need enhanced search awareness for efficient code navigation and text editing tasks.
