CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database system written in Go that implements a horizontally scalable, strongly-consistent transactional database built on a key-value store foundation. It targets enterprise and cloud-native applications requiring high availability, automatic failover, and global data distribution across multiple datacenters. The system provides PostgreSQL wire protocol compatibility, enabling integration with existing PostgreSQL drivers and ORMs across multiple programming languages. CockroachDB addresses distributed systems challenges including network partitions, node failures, and data consistency through RAFT consensus and distributed transaction protocols. Primary users include database administrators, backend developers, and DevOps engineers building large-scale web applications, microservices architectures, and multi-region deployments that require ACID compliance with horizontal scaling capabilities beyond traditional relational databases.
