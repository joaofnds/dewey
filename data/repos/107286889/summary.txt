`croc` is a command-line tool facilitating secure, cross-platform file and folder transfers between any two computers. Built in Go, it leverages end-to-end encryption via Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) and utilizes a relay server for peer-to-peer connections, enabling transfers without local server requirements or port forwarding. Key functionalities include resuming interrupted transfers, support for multiple files, IPv6-first with IPv4 fallback, proxy support (e.g., Tor), and customizable encryption and hashing algorithms. The project is a standalone CLI application designed for users needing a simple, secure method for data transfer across various operating systems.
