`croc` is a command-line file transfer tool written in Go that enables secure peer-to-peer data transmission between any two computers across networks. It implements Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) for end-to-end encryption and uses TCP relay servers to bypass NAT/firewall restrictions without requiring port forwarding. The tool supports cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, macOS), resume interrupted transfers, handles multiple files/folders, and provides IPv6-first connectivity with IPv4 fallback. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who need secure file sharing across different networks, `croc` solves the problem of easily transferring files between machines that cannot establish direct connections, using cryptographic code phrases for authentication and automated relay discovery for seamless connectivity.
