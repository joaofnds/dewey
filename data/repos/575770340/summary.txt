Veryl is a hardware description language (HDL) written in Rust, designed as a modern alternative to SystemVerilog. It enables digital logic design and supports RTL (Register Transfer Level) descriptions. Key features include optimized syntax for synthesizability, interoperability with SystemVerilog, and productivity-enhancing development tools like package managers and real-time checkers, with a focus on readability and ease of learning. This project is a language implementation, providing tools for hardware designers to develop digital systems.
