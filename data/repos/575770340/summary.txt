Veryl is a modern hardware description language (HDL) implemented in Rust that targets digital circuit design and RTL development. It serves as a transpiler that compiles Veryl source code to SystemVerilog, addressing the complexity and tooling limitations of traditional HDLs in the semiconductor and FPGA industries. The language provides optimized syntax for logic design, guaranteed synthesizability, and interoperability with existing SystemVerilog codebases while maintaining readable transpiled output. Veryl includes comprehensive development tooling such as package management, build systems, LSP-compatible editors support, and automatic formatting. It targets hardware engineers, RTL designers, and ASIC/FPGA developers who need a more productive alternative to SystemVerilog without sacrificing compatibility with established EDA tool workflows and existing Verilog-based design methodologies.
