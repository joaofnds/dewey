`emojify` is a shell script command-line utility designed to replace emoji aliases with their corresponding raw emoji characters. It enhances command-line output readability by translating emoji shorthands used by services like GitHub. Users can integrate it with other commands, such as `git log`, to improve their visual output in the terminal. The project is a standalone CLI application written in Shell and is targeted toward developers and users of command-line interfaces, especially those who use Git.
