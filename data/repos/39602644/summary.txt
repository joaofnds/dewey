**emojify** is a Bash shell script utility that transforms emoji aliases (like `:scream:` or `:bee:`) into their corresponding Unicode emoji characters directly in the command line. Designed for developers and system administrators working in terminal environments, it addresses the need to display emoji in command-line outputs, particularly useful for enhancing git commit logs, documentation, and terminal-based workflows. The script leverages Bash 4+ associative arrays for emoji mapping and integrates seamlessly with Unix pipes, making it ideal for DevOps practitioners who want to add visual context to their command-line tools. It supports integration with git through custom aliases and can process any text input, converting GitHub-style emoji shortcodes into rendered emoji characters for improved readability in terminal-based development workflows.
