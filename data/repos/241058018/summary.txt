Bufler.el is an Emacs Lisp package that provides advanced buffer management and workspace organization for Emacs text editor users. It implements programmable grouping rules to automatically categorize open buffers by project, directory, mode, or custom criteria, replacing the basic buffer-list functionality. The package features a hierarchical buffer browser, intelligent buffer switching with completion, dynamic workspace management per frame, and integration with Emacs 27's tab-bar/tab-line systems. It targets software developers, writers, and power users who work with numerous files simultaneously in Emacs, solving the problem of buffer chaos in complex editing sessions. The system uses Emacs Lisp for configuration and integrates with completion frameworks like Helm and Ivy, providing a butler-like interface for buffer organization without manual workspace maintenance.
