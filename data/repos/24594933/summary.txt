Unleash is an open-source feature management platform built in TypeScript that enables DevOps teams and software developers to implement feature flags and toggles in production applications. The platform provides activation strategies for controlled feature rollouts, A/B testing capabilities, and gradual deployment mechanisms across multiple environments. It offers both frontend and server-side SDKs for integration with various programming languages and frameworks, supporting continuous delivery workflows through API-first architecture. The system includes Docker deployment options, audit logging, webhook integrations, and role-based access controls for enterprise environments. Unleash primarily targets platform engineering teams, DevOps practitioners, and development organizations seeking to decouple code deployment from feature releases while enabling safer production rollouts and experimentation workflows.
