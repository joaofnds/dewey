`glish` is a TypeScript project designed to transform English text into a monosyllabic version. The core functionality involves processing a CMU dictionary, syllabifying words based on their IPA pronunciations, and generating new monosyllabic representations. This is achieved through scripts (`syllablize.ts`, `main.ts`, `sonorityGraph.ts`, and `respellIPA.ts`) that parse input data (word frequencies and syllabified pronunciations) to create the linguistic transformation. A separate UI component provides an interactive demo of the language. This is a standalone application with a frontend component, targeted at those interested in experimental linguistics or linguistic data processing.
