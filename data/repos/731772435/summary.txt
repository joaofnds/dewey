Glish is a TypeScript-based computational linguistics project that systematically converts English words into monosyllabic equivalents using phonetic analysis and transformation algorithms. The system processes the CMU Pronunciation Dictionary to extract IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) representations, applies syllable reduction through sonority sequencing principles, and generates a comprehensive English-to-monosyllabic mapping. Core components include syllable parsing, phonetic graph data structures for valid sound combinations, and IPA-to-Latin alphabet respelling functionality. The project targets linguists, language researchers, and developers interested in natural language processing and phonetic manipulation, providing both programmatic APIs and an interactive web-based translation tool for exploring constructed language variants and phonological compression techniques.
