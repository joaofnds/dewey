The Probable-Wordlists repository provides cybersecurity professionals and penetration testers with probability-sorted password wordlists derived from analysis of over 350GB of leaked password data spanning 1600 breach files. The project aggregates approximately 13 billion real-world passwords, filtering for entries appearing at least 5 times across sources to produce 2 billion probability-ranked passwords for dictionary attacks, password strength testing, and security auditing. Target users include security researchers, red team operators, system administrators, and developers implementing password validation systems who need realistic password datasets for vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and password policy enforcement rather than alphabetically-sorted or random wordlists that don't reflect actual user behavior patterns.
