`berzerk0/Probable-Wordlists` provides a curated collection of password wordlists, sorted by probability of use, designed for password security analysis and testing. The repository compiles and ranks real-world passwords, derived from numerous data breaches and leaks, to identify and highlight the most common and, consequently, least secure passwords. Primarily a data resource, it functions as a dataset and analytical tool for password strength assessment, enabling users to understand common password vulnerabilities and improve password creation practices. The project's methodology involves merging a large volume of leaked password data, filtering duplicates, and ordering entries based on frequency of appearance, ultimately presenting a list of approximately two billion passwords in order of popularity.
