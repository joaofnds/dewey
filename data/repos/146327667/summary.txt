Vector is a high-performance, open-source observability data pipeline built in Rust, designed to collect, transform, and route logs, metrics, and (soon) traces. Functionality includes data parsing, aggregation, and forwarding, acting as both an agent and an aggregator. This standalone application enables cost reduction, data enrichment, and vendor transition, supporting integrations with various sources and sinks. It employs a multi-core architecture optimized for high throughput stream processing and offers features like reliable data delivery guarantees. This project targets system administrators and DevOps engineers managing observability infrastructure.
