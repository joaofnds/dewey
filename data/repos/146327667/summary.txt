Vector is a high-performance observability data pipeline built in Rust for DevOps and site reliability engineering teams. It functions as both an agent and aggregator to collect, transform, and route logs, metrics, and traces across distributed systems. The platform addresses vendor lock-in and observability cost optimization by providing a unified streaming data processor that integrates with multiple sources (Docker, Kafka, journald, HTTP) and sinks (AWS CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, S3, ClickHouse). Vector features a custom remap language (VRL) for data transformation, supports Kubernetes deployments, and offers adaptive request concurrency for network optimization. It targets system administrators, platform engineers, and DevOps teams managing large-scale observability infrastructure who need reliable, performant data routing without vendor dependency.
