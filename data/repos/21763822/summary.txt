Doom Emacs is a configuration framework for GNU Emacs, designed to provide a streamlined and performant Emacs experience, particularly for users familiar with Vim. It offers curated configurations, sane defaults, and a modular structure to manage custom configurations. Core features include a declarative package management system built on `straight.el`, optional Vim emulation powered by `evil-mode` with ports of popular Vim plugins, and extensive support for programming language tooling like LSP integration, syntax highlighting, and code completion. This project is a framework and configuration resource targeted towards Emacs users and developers seeking a modern, customizable, and efficient text editing environment.
