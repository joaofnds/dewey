m1n1 is a specialized bootloader and hardware experimentation framework designed for Apple Silicon Macs, serving as a critical component in the Asahi Linux project to enable Linux installation on Apple M1/M2 systems. Built primarily in C with Python tooling, it functions as a low-level system software that bridges Apple's boot environment with Linux kernels, supporting payload concatenation for kernel images, device tree blobs, and initramfs. The project targets embedded systems developers, reverse engineers, and Linux distribution maintainers working on ARM64 architecture porting. It solves the fundamental problem of booting alternative operating systems on Apple's custom silicon by providing hardware abstraction, device initialization, and kernel loading capabilities, while also serving as a research platform for understanding Apple Silicon hardware internals and developing drivers for Linux compatibility.
