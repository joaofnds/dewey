`m1n1` is a Python-based bootloader and experimentation playground designed for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) hardware. It enables users to load custom payloads, including kernel images, device tree blobs, and initramfs images, supporting multiple compression formats. Built with a cross-compilation workflow, it utilizes aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc and relies on libraries such as libfdt, minlzma, and tinf, with additional components from arm-trusted-firmware and musl-libc. This project is a standalone bootloader application targeted toward developers and researchers working on low-level system modifications and kernel development on Apple Silicon.
