Spacedrive is an open-source, cross-platform file explorer and manager designed to consolidate files across multiple devices and cloud services. Powered by a virtual distributed filesystem (VDFS) written in Rust, it offers features including encryption and real-time synchronization to provide users with a unified, secure, and intuitive file management experience. The project utilizes a "PRRTT" architecture, leveraging Tauri for a native desktop application, TypeScript for the frontend, Prisma with a Rust client for data management, and rspc for type-safe communication between the Rust backend (`sdcore`) and the UI, with core logic written in Rust. Primarily a standalone application, it targets users seeking to manage and own their digital data across various storage locations.
