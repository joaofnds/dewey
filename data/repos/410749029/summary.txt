Spacedrive is a cross-platform file management system that implements a Virtual Distributed Filesystem (VDFS) to unify storage across multiple devices and cloud services. Built with a Rust backend for the distributed filesystem logic and TypeScript/React frontend for the user interface, it uses content-addressable storage (CAS) for file identification and real-time database synchronization between clients. The system targets personal data management and storage consolidation, allowing users to organize files across local drives, cloud services, and networked devices through a single interface. Designed for content creators, digital archivists, and privacy-conscious users who need centralized file management without vendor lock-in, it operates in the personal cloud storage and file synchronization domain while maintaining local data ownership and cross-platform compatibility.
