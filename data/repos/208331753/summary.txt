esmBot is an open-source Discord bot implementation built with TypeScript and the Oceanic Discord library, designed for entertainment and community engagement in Discord servers. The bot specializes in image processing using libvips for performant media manipulation, music playback through Lavalink integration, and utility commands. It features both slash commands and traditional prefix-based command handling, supports multiple database backends (PostgreSQL/SQLite), and implements PM2-based clustering for scalability. The system includes a local web server for handling large file outputs, optional external API integration with load balancing, and a flexible command handler architecture. Target users include Discord server administrators, community managers, and developers seeking to deploy entertainment bots with robust image processing capabilities and multi-source music streaming functionality.
