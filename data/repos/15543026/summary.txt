`hamcrest/hamcrest-php` is the official PHP port of the Hamcrest matching library, designed for writing flexible and readable tests. It provides a comprehensive set of matchers for asserting various conditions on data, including arrays, collections, objects, numbers, strings, and XML. This library facilitates writing expressive assertions within PHPUnit and similar testing frameworks, enabling developers to validate results based on value, type, structure, and other complex criteria. The core technology is PHP, and the project functions as a developer-focused testing library, offering global proxy functions for ease of use.
