This repository is a comprehensive educational resource and reference implementation demonstrating Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles combined with Hexagonal Architecture for backend web application development. Built using TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS framework, and database integration libraries like Slonik and TypeORM, it provides practical code examples implementing clean architecture patterns including CQRS, aggregate design, value objects, domain events, and dependency inversion. The project serves as a learning guide for backend developers seeking to implement enterprise-grade software architecture patterns, focusing on maintainable, testable, and scalable server-side applications. It addresses the problem of designing complex business logic with proper separation of concerns, offering framework-agnostic architectural principles that can be adapted across different technology stacks for building robust backend systems.
