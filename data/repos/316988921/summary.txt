This TypeScript repository provides comprehensive guidance and code examples for implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD), software architecture, and design patterns in backend applications. It demonstrates key architectural patterns, including Hexagonal, Clean, and Onion architectures, leveraging TypeScript, NodeJS, and NestJS with a focus on secure-by-design principles and SOLID principles. The project serves as an example/template, showcasing functionalities such as command-query separation (CQS), domain event handling, and layered architecture, enabling developers to build maintainable, testable, and scalable backend systems.
