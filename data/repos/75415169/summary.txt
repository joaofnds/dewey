lsp-mode is an Emacs Lisp client implementation for the Language Server Protocol (LSP) v3.14, providing IDE-like capabilities within the Emacs text editor. It targets software developers across multiple programming domains including web development (JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML), systems programming (C++, Rust, Go), mobile development (Swift, Dart), and enterprise development (Java, Scala, Python, PHP, Ruby). The package integrates with existing Emacs ecosystem tools like flycheck for diagnostics, company-mode for code completion, projectile for project management, and xref for navigation. It enables asynchronous language server communication to deliver features like real-time linting, code completion, hover documentation, code actions, formatting, and symbol navigation across 19+ supported programming languages, solving the problem of fragmented IDE tooling by centralizing language intelligence through standardized LSP communication.
