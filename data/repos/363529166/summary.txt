Diffview.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides a unified tabpage interface for Git and Mercurial diff operations within the editor. Targeting software developers using Neovim for version control workflows, it consolidates modified file diffs into a single view, enabling efficient cycling through changes across any Git revision or commit range. The plugin offers specialized functionality for merge conflict resolution with 3-way and 4-way diff layouts, file history visualization as a Git log porcelain interface, and staging capabilities for individual hunks. It integrates with nvim-web-devicons for enhanced UI presentation and supports both Git (≥2.31.0) and Mercurial (≥5.4.0) repositories. The tool addresses the limitation of Vim's native diff mode by streamlining code review processes and merge conflict resolution for developers working with version-controlled codebases.
