`diffview.nvim` is a Neovim plugin providing a single tabpage interface for navigating and reviewing diffs of modified files within a Git repository. It enables users to easily cycle through diffs for any Git revision, including merge conflicts, with support for file history views, staging changes, and merge conflict resolution tools. The plugin is written in Lua and leverages Neovim's features and integrates with Git commands and optional dependencies like `nvim-web-devicons` for file icon display, aimed at developers seeking enhanced diff and version control functionality directly within their Neovim workflow.
