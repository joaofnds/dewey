Artillery is a comprehensive load testing platform built in JavaScript/TypeScript that enables developers and DevOps engineers to conduct production-grade performance testing across multiple protocols including HTTP APIs, GraphQL, WebSocket, gRPC, and Socket.io. The platform integrates with AWS Lambda and Fargate for serverless distributed testing, incorporates Playwright for browser-based load testing, and supports OpenTelemetry for observability. Artillery addresses the critical need for scalable performance validation in modern web applications and microservices architectures, allowing engineering teams to simulate complex user behaviors, model realistic workloads, and identify performance bottlenecks before production deployment. The tool targets software developers, QA engineers, and site reliability engineers working in cloud-native environments who require automated, programmable load testing capabilities integrated with CI/CD pipelines.
