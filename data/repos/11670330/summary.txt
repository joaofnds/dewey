Interactor is a Ruby gem that implements the Command Pattern to encapsulate business logic in web applications through single-purpose service objects. Designed for Ruby on Rails developers, it provides a standardized interface for organizing complex user interactions and business operations into discrete, testable units. Each interactor operates on a shared context object that carries data between operations, supports success/failure states, and includes comprehensive hook systems (before, after, around) for cross-cutting concerns. The gem enables composition through organizers that chain multiple interactors together, promoting cleaner controller code and better separation of concerns. It targets backend Ruby developers building maintainable web applications who need to extract business logic from models and controllers into reusable, focused service objects with consistent error handling and workflow management.
