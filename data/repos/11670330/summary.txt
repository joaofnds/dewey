`Interactor` is a Ruby library providing a consistent interface for encapsulating and executing application business logic as single-purpose objects. It allows developers to define "interactors" that perform discrete tasks, receiving a "context" representing their inputs and outputs, and offers features such as before, after, and around hooks for controlling execution flow. Interactors can be chained together using "organizers" to orchestrate complex operations. The project is a library aimed at Ruby developers seeking to improve the organization and testability of application code, particularly within a Rails environment.
