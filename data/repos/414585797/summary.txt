Universal Android Debloater is a cross-platform GUI application written in Rust that uses Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to remove bloatware from non-rooted Android devices. Targeting the mobile device management and Android privacy domain, it provides system administrators and privacy-conscious users with the ability to uninstall or disable pre-installed system packages from major OEMs (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, etc.), carriers, and tech giants (Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft). The tool supports multi-device connections, multi-user profiles, package restoration, and maintains comprehensive debloat lists for different manufacturers and carriers. It addresses the problem of unwanted system applications that consume resources and compromise privacy by leveraging ADB commands through a user-friendly Rust-based interface without requiring device rooting.
