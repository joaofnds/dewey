**monkeylib-foo** is a deprecated Common Lisp library originally designed for HTML generation and web content output, primarily targeting web development workflows. The repository served as a comprehensive toolkit for generating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programmatically from Lisp code, including a custom "Lispscript" language for JavaScript generation. Its core functionality has been extracted into separate, more focused libraries: monkeylib-text-output for text processing, monkeylib-text-languages for language-specific output, and monkeylib-html for HTML generation. The remaining codebase contains legacy CSS and JavaScript generation utilities alongside the experimental Lispscript transpiler. This library was designed for Lisp developers building web applications who needed programmatic control over front-end asset generation and HTML templating within a functional programming paradigm.
