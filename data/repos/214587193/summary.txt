Supabase is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform that provides a Firebase alternative for web, mobile, and AI application developers. Built on PostgreSQL as the core database, it integrates enterprise-grade open-source tools including PostgREST for auto-generated REST APIs, GoTrue for JWT-based authentication, Realtime for WebSocket-based database subscriptions, and pg_graphql for GraphQL support. The platform addresses the need for a comprehensive backend infrastructure by offering database management, user authentication, file storage, edge functions, and AI/vector embedding capabilities through pgvector. Implemented primarily in TypeScript with Elixir components, Supabase targets full-stack developers building modern applications who require scalable PostgreSQL-backed services with real-time features, eliminating the complexity of managing separate backend services and providing both hosted and self-hosted deployment options.
