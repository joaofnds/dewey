`headscale` is an open-source, self-hosted implementation of the Tailscale control server. Written in Go, it provides an alternative to the proprietary control server used by the Tailscale VPN, enabling users to manage their own WireGuard-based overlay networks. Key functionalities include assigning IP addresses, managing user boundaries, and exposing advertised routes within a private Tailscale network (tailnet). This project is a standalone application targeting self-hosters and hobbyists seeking to build and control their own private network infrastructure.
