Headscale is an open-source, self-hosted implementation of Tailscale's control server built in Go, targeting network administrators and self-hosting enthusiasts. It provides a private alternative to Tailscale's commercial control plane for managing WireGuard-based mesh VPN networks. The system handles WireGuard public key exchange, IP address assignment, user boundaries, machine sharing, and route advertisement for nodes in a tailnet (Tailscale network). Designed for DevOps and infrastructure management domains, it enables hobbyists and small organizations to operate their own secure overlay networks without relying on Tailscale's hosted service. The project uses Protocol Buffers for API definitions, integrates with existing Tailscale clients across multiple operating systems, and focuses on single-tailnet deployments suitable for personal labs and small-scale enterprise environments.
