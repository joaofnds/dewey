Notable is a cross-platform desktop note-taking application built with Electron and React that targets knowledge workers and developers seeking a markdown-centric writing environment. The application renders GitHub Flavored Markdown with support for KaTeX mathematical expressions and Mermaid diagrams, utilizing VS Code's Monaco editor for syntax highlighting and advanced editing features. It addresses vendor lock-in concerns by storing notes as plain markdown files on the local filesystem, enabling version control integration, regex-based search operations, and external editor compatibility. The application features a split-editor view, multi-note operations, nested tagging system, and dark theme support, positioning itself in the productivity software domain as an alternative to proprietary note-taking solutions like Evernote for users who prioritize markdown workflow integration and data portability.
