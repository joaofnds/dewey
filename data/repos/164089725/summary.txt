WBOT is a Node.js-based WhatsApp Web automation bot that enables programmatic interaction with WhatsApp through browser automation using Puppeteer. Targeting developers and automation enthusiasts in the messaging/communication domain, it provides a configurable JSON-driven framework for creating automated responses, media file downloads, and webhook integrations. The bot operates by controlling a Chrome/Chromium browser instance to interact with WhatsApp Web, supporting features like keyword-based message matching, group chat handling, unread message processing, and custom JavaScript injection. Built for cross-platform deployment (Windows, macOS, Linux), it serves developers seeking to automate WhatsApp messaging workflows for customer service, notifications, or personal automation without requiring official WhatsApp Business API access.
