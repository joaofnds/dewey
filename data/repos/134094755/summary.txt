`dap-mode` is an Emacs package providing Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) support, enabling debugging capabilities within the Emacs text editor. This project facilitates debugging for multiple programming languages including C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, PHP, PowerShell, Ruby, Rust, Swift, and TypeScript.  It leverages the Debug Adapter Protocol to interface with language-specific debuggers, offering functionality to step through code, inspect variables, and manage breakpoints directly within the Emacs environment. This plugin extends Emacs's features, enhancing its utility as an integrated development environment (IDE).
