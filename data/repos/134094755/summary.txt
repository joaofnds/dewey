dap-mode is an Emacs client implementation of Microsoft's Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), providing integrated debugging capabilities within the Emacs editor environment. Built in Emacs Lisp, it enables developers to debug applications across multiple programming languages including Java, Python, C/C++, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Rust, Swift, and others through a unified interface. The package integrates with the Language Server Protocol (LSP) ecosystem and supports both local and Docker-containerized debugging workflows. It offers standard debugging features like breakpoint management, variable inspection, stack trace navigation, and step-through execution. Target users are software developers who prefer Emacs as their primary development environment and need comprehensive debugging support across polyglot codebases, eliminating the need to switch between different language-specific debugging tools or IDEs.
