The `TheAlgorithms/C` repository provides a comprehensive collection of algorithms implemented in C, serving as an educational resource for computer science and mathematics. It features implementations spanning diverse domains like machine learning, data structures, and sorting, designed for learning and experimentation. Each implementation utilizes the standard C library (`libc`), promoting portability and understanding of core algorithmic principles; it adheres to the C11 standard and has been tested on MacOS and Ubuntu. This is an open-source library project with detailed documentation, offering both code examples and explanations, targeting students and educators seeking to understand fundamental algorithmic concepts.
