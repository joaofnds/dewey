TheAlgorithms/C is a comprehensive educational repository containing open-source implementations of fundamental algorithms across computer science, mathematics, machine learning, and physics domains, written entirely in C programming language. The codebase adheres to C11 standards using only standard libc without external dependencies, ensuring portability to embedded systems like ESP32 and ARM Cortex. It serves as a technical learning resource for computer science students, educators, and developers preparing for algorithm-focused interviews, featuring well-documented implementations of data structures, sorting algorithms, search algorithms, mathematical computations, and machine learning algorithms. The repository includes automated testing, continuous integration workflows, and comprehensive documentation generated via Doxygen, targeting educational institutions and self-learners studying algorithmic fundamentals.
