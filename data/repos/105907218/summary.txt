lgo is a Jupyter Notebook kernel implementation that enables interactive Go programming within Jupyter environments, targeting data science and machine learning workflows. Built in Go, it provides a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface that allows developers to execute Go code interactively, similar to Python notebooks. The project integrates with the Jupyter ecosystem using ZMQ messaging protocols and supports full Go language specifications with gc compiler compatibility. It addresses the gap in interactive Go development for data scientists and researchers who need exploratory programming capabilities. The kernel supports code completion, inspection, and rich media display (HTML, JavaScript, SVG) within notebooks. However, the project faces compatibility issues with Go versions 1.10+ due to compiler toolchain regressions, limiting its current practical usage.
