SectorLISP is a minimal LISP interpreter implementation designed for systems programming and computer science education, demonstrating bootstrapping techniques by fitting a complete LISP environment into a 512-byte x86 boot sector. The project provides three implementations: a pure LISP meta-circular evaluator based on John McCarthy's original paper, a portable C reference implementation with POSIX compatibility, and an ultra-compact i8086 assembly version that boots directly from BIOS without an operating system. It targets systems programmers, computer science researchers, and educators interested in programming language theory, compiler bootstrapping, and minimal computing environments. The implementation solves the challenge of creating the smallest possible functional LISP interpreter while maintaining the language's essential features, serving as both a technical achievement in code golf and an educational tool for understanding fundamental computing concepts.
