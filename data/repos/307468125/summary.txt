`sectorlisp` is a project focused on implementing LISP in resource-constrained environments. It provides a 512-byte LISP implementation that boots from a BIOS, enabling the execution of a meta-circular evaluator on bare metal, specifically targeting i8086 architecture. The repository includes a portable C reference implementation and a LISP implementation written in LISP itself. This project provides a demonstration of a minimal LISP implementation for educational and experimental purposes, offering a bootable master boot record.
