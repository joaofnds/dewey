RSpec-metagem is a Ruby package distribution tool that serves as a unified dependency manager for the RSpec testing framework ecosystem. It aggregates three core RSpec components—rspec-core (test runner and structure), rspec-expectations (assertion library), and rspec-mocks (test doubles)—into a single installable gem for Ruby developers. The metagem enables modular usage, allowing developers to selectively integrate individual RSpec components with other testing frameworks like Test::Unit or alternative mocking libraries (Mocha, RR, Flexmock). Targeting Ruby web developers, backend engineers, and software teams practicing Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), it simplifies RSpec installation and setup while maintaining component flexibility. This repository has been deprecated in favor of a monorepo structure but represents the traditional approach to Ruby gem distribution for testing infrastructure.
