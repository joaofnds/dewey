`rspec-metagem` is a Ruby meta-gem providing a dependency definition for the core RSpec testing framework. It bundles the `rspec-core`, `rspec-expectations`, and `rspec-mocks` gems, enabling Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in Ruby projects. This project acts as a central point for installing the complete RSpec suite, facilitating the use of its components like expectations and mocking within various Ruby testing environments, including integration with alternative assertion libraries. It is a library primarily for Ruby developers seeking to implement robust and flexible testing strategies.
