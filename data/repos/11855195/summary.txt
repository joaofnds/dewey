Chalk is a JavaScript library for terminal string styling and colorization, specifically designed for CLI applications and command-line tools. It provides ANSI escape code generation to apply colors, backgrounds, and text modifiers (bold, underline, etc.) to console output in Node.js environments. The library offers a chainable API for composing multiple styles, supports 256-color and Truecolor modes, automatically detects terminal color capabilities, and handles color level fallbacks. Targeted at JavaScript developers building CLI tools, development utilities, and terminal-based applications, Chalk solves the problem of creating visually appealing and readable console output across different terminal emulators. As an ES module with zero dependencies, it's widely adopted by over 115,000 npm packages for enhancing developer tooling, build systems, and command-line interfaces with professional terminal styling.
