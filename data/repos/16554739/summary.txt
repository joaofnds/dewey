Beats is a collection of lightweight data collection agents written in Go that specialize in operational data monitoring and log management for the Elastic Stack ecosystem. The repository contains seven specialized "beats" (Filebeat, Metricbeat, Packetbeat, Heartbeat, Auditbeat, Winlogbeat, and Osquerybeat) plus libbeat, a Go framework for building custom data shippers. These agents target DevOps and system administration use cases by collecting diverse operational data including log files, system metrics, network packets, service availability checks, and Windows event logs, then forwarding this data to Elasticsearch or Logstash for analysis and visualization in Kibana. The solution addresses the critical need for centralized observability in distributed systems, providing system administrators and DevOps engineers with minimal-overhead monitoring tools that require no runtime dependencies while maintaining comprehensive data collection capabilities across heterogeneous infrastructure environments.
