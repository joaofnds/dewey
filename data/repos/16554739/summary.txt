`elastic/beats` is a collection of lightweight, Go-based data shippers designed to ingest operational data into the Elastic Stack. These standalone applications, including Filebeat, Metricbeat, and Winlogbeat, collect logs, metrics, and network data from various sources and transport it to Elasticsearch and Logstash. The framework, built upon the `libbeat` library, facilitates the creation of custom data shippers, targeting system administrators and developers needing to monitor and analyze operational data within their infrastructure.
