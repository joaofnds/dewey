macOS-Simple-KVM is a virtualization toolkit that enables running macOS virtual machines on Linux systems using QEMU hypervisor with KVM acceleration. Primarily targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who need macOS environments for cross-platform development or testing without Apple hardware. The repository provides shell scripts for automated macOS VM provisioning, supporting multiple macOS versions (High Sierra through Big Sur) with features like headless deployment, VNC access, and Virtual Machine Manager integration. It addresses the "Hackintosh" use case by simplifying the complex process of macOS virtualization on x86-64 Linux hosts, offering performance optimization guides for memory allocation, GPU passthrough, networking configuration, and display resolution tuning for production-grade macOS virtualization workflows.
