This repository provides tools and documentation for quickly setting up and running macOS virtual machines within QEMU, leveraging KVM hardware acceleration for improved performance. Functionality includes scripts for downloading macOS installation media, creating virtual hard disks, and configuring a basic VM setup, supporting various macOS versions such as Catalina, Big Sur, and Mojave. Implemented primarily in Shell scripting, the project simplifies the process of macOS virtualization on Linux systems, with options for headless operation and integration with Virt-Manager. It functions as a developer tool and template project, intended for system administrators and developers looking to run macOS environments on Linux hosts.
