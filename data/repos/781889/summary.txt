`inf-ruby` is an Emacs Lisp package that provides an interactive Ruby REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) buffer connected to a Ruby subprocess within the Emacs text editor. Targeting Ruby developers in web development and general programming domains, it integrates with Ruby interpreters including IRB, Pry, and project-specific consoles for Rails applications and Ruby gems. The package offers seamless code evaluation by sending Ruby definitions, regions, and expressions from Emacs buffers directly to the running Ruby process, with support for tab completion, debugging integration, and Docker containerized environments. It solves the workflow problem of context-switching between code editing and REPL testing by embedding the Ruby interpreter directly into the Emacs development environment, enabling rapid iterative development for Ruby programmers who use Emacs as their primary IDE.
