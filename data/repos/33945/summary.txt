Nokogiri is a Ruby library providing a comprehensive API for parsing, manipulating, and querying XML and HTML documents. It leverages native parsers like libxml2 and libxslt (C dependencies), as well as Xerces and NekoHTML for its JRuby implementation, to provide fast and standards-compliant processing. Key functionalities include DOM and SAX parsing, XPath/CSS3 querying, XSD schema validation, and XSLT transformation, enabling developers to read, write, modify, and search XML/HTML content efficiently. This library is a Ruby gem primarily intended for Ruby developers working with structured data formats.
