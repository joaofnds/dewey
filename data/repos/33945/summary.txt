Nokogiri is a Ruby gem that provides XML and HTML parsing, manipulation, and transformation capabilities for web developers and Ruby programmers. Built as a C extension wrapping native parsers like libxml2, libgumbo, and xerces, it offers DOM, SAX, and push parsing modes along with XPath 1.0 and CSS3 selector-based document querying. The library supports XSD schema validation, XSLT transformations, and includes a builder DSL for programmatic document construction. Designed with security-first principles treating all documents as untrusted by default, Nokogiri serves as a thin abstraction layer over underlying C parsers while maintaining performance and standards compliance. It primarily targets Ruby developers working with web scraping, API integration, document processing, and XML/HTML manipulation tasks in web development workflows.
