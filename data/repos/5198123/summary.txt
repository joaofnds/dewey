Zeus is a Go-based application preloader designed to accelerate Rails development workflows by significantly reducing the boot time of Rails applications, enabling faster execution of commands such as `console`, `server`, and tests. It operates as a language-agnostic application checkpointer, with explicit support for Ruby-based Rails applications, utilizing file system event monitoring to facilitate quick command execution without repeatedly reloading the application environment. Users can leverage Zeus through command-line interface (CLI) commands to manage and interact with their Rails projects, providing a development productivity enhancement, and it is designed for Rails developers.
