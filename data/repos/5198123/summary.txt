Zeus is a Rails application preloader written in Go that accelerates Ruby on Rails development workflows by reducing command execution times to under one second. Targeting Rails 3.x/4.x web development environments, it functions as a language-agnostic application checkpointer that preloads Rails applications and maintains persistent processes for common development tasks including console sessions, server startup, test execution, code generation, and rake tasks. The tool operates through process forking and file system monitoring (FSEvents/inotify), requiring macOS 13+ or Linux 2.6.13+ with compatible filesystems. Zeus addresses the chronic slow boot time problem in Rails development by eliminating the Rails initialization overhead for each command invocation, primarily serving Ruby on Rails developers who frequently execute development commands and need faster feedback loops during active development sessions.
