This repository maintains automatically-updated lists of functional public BitTorrent trackers, serving the peer-to-peer file sharing ecosystem. It provides curated tracker lists categorized by protocol type (UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, I2P) and quality tiers, with 107 total trackers including a "best 20" subset. An automated bot continuously monitors tracker availability, removes duplicates and dead endpoints, and ranks them by popularity and latency. The lists are distributed as plain text files via GitHub, with multiple CDN mirrors for high availability. Target users include BitTorrent client developers, torrent users experiencing connectivity issues, and system administrators managing P2P infrastructure. The repository addresses the common problem of outdated or non-functional tracker lists that degrade torrent download performance and peer discovery in decentralized file sharing networks.
