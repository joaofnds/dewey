f1-dash is a real-time Formula 1 telemetry dashboard application built with Next.js and TypeScript for the frontend and Rust for backend data processing. The system provides live visualization of F1 race data including leaderboards, tire information, timing gaps, lap counts, and mini-sector telemetry during active Formula 1 sessions. It targets motorsport enthusiasts and developers interested in real-time data visualization, utilizing WebSocket connections or similar streaming protocols to deliver low-latency updates. The multi-language architecture leverages Rust's performance for data ingestion and processing while using React/Next.js for responsive dashboard components, solving the need for accessible, real-time F1 race monitoring outside official broadcasting channels.
