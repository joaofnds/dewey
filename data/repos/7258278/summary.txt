Redshift is a C-based desktop utility that dynamically adjusts monitor color temperature to reduce eye strain during night-time computer usage. The application targets desktop Linux/Windows/macOS environments and primarily serves end-users, system administrators, and desktop environment developers. It manipulates display gamma correction ramps to apply red-tinted color filters, automatically scheduling temperature changes based on geographic location and time of day. The tool integrates with various display server protocols (X11, Wayland) and provides both command-line and GTK-based GUI interfaces. Redshift addresses the computer vision syndrome problem in desktop computing environments, though modern desktop environments (GNOME, KDE Plasma, Windows, macOS) have largely superseded it with native implementations that avoid gamma ramp limitations and provide more robust color temperature management.
