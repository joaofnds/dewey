Redshift is a standalone C application designed to adjust the color temperature of a computer screen, mitigating eye strain, especially during nighttime use. It achieves this through the manipulation of gamma ramps to apply a red-tinting effect, controlled by user configuration and geographical location data. The software provides a command-line interface and an optional graphical user interface (GUI) via `redshift-gtk`. This project functions as a utility for desktop environments but relies on an older, less standardized approach for applying color effects, which is also reflected in its issues/FAQ section.
