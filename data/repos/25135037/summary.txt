Deskflow is a cross-platform C++ application that enables keyboard and mouse sharing across multiple networked computers, functioning as a software-based KVM switch without video transmission. Built for system administrators, power users, and multi-computer setups, it implements network-based input device emulation with TLS encryption for secure communication between client and server instances. The application supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD systems, with Wayland compatibility and clipboard synchronization capabilities. Using native OS APIs for input capture and injection, Deskflow solves the workspace efficiency problem of managing multiple physical machines by allowing seamless cursor and keyboard control transitions across network boundaries, eliminating the need for multiple input devices in multi-computer environments.
