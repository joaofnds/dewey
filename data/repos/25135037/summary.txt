Deskflow is a standalone, cross-platform application written in C++ that enables sharing a single keyboard and mouse across multiple computers, functioning as a software-based KVM (without video). It provides keyboard and mouse emulation over a network, utilizing TLS encryption by default and supporting Wayland and clipboard sharing. The project includes GUI and command-line interfaces, and is actively maintained with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a developer productivity tool for users managing multiple machines.
