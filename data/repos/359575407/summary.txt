Pretty Routes for Laravel is a PHP package that enhances Laravel's built-in route inspection capabilities by providing a visually improved console command for displaying application routes. Targeting Laravel web developers, this Artisan command extension replaces the standard `php artisan route:list` with a more readable, formatted output that includes advanced filtering options such as path exclusion/inclusion, HTTP method filtering, name-based filtering, and grouping capabilities. The package addresses the common developer need for better route visualization during Laravel application development and debugging, offering console-based route analysis with enhanced readability and organization. It integrates directly into Laravel's Artisan CLI framework and has been deprecated since Laravel 9 incorporated similar functionality natively into the core framework.
