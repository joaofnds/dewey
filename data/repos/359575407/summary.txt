`pretty-routes` is a PHP library providing enhanced console output for Laravel route information. It formats and displays Laravel application routes, using the `artisan` command-line interface. Users can customize the display through options for filtering routes by path, method, and name, as well as options for reverse sorting and grouping. This is a developer productivity tool, intended for backend Laravel developers needing to visualize and debug route configurations.
