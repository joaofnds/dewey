Core features include creating working containers, building images from Dockerfiles or working containers, mounting/unmounting container filesystems, and committing changes to create new images. This project is a developer productivity tool, specifically for system administrators and developers working with containerization, focusing on efficient image construction and integration with scripting languages.
