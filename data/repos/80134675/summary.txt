Buildah is a command-line tool written in Go that specializes in building OCI (Open Container Initiative) and Docker-compatible container images for DevOps and containerization workflows. It provides a comprehensive API and CLI interface that replicates Dockerfile commands while enabling rootless image construction and scriptable build processes without requiring a daemon. The tool targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and container developers who need fine-grained control over image creation, allowing them to build containers from scratch, mount/manipulate filesystems, and integrate custom scripting languages into build pipelines. Buildah complements Podman by focusing specifically on image building rather than container runtime management, offering a lower-level coreutils-style interface for container image construction in Linux environments.
