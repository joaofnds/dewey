ruby/debug is a modern debugging library for Ruby (MRI) 2.7+ that replaces the traditional lib/debug.rb standard library implementation. Built for Ruby developers, it provides high-performance debugging capabilities with zero overhead in non-stepping mode, supporting remote debugging via UNIX domain sockets and TCP/IP connections. The debugger integrates with multiple development environments including console, VSCode (via vscode-rdbg extension), and Chrome DevTools, offering features like breakpoint management, step-through debugging, variable inspection, and recording/replay functionality. It addresses the core problem of efficient Ruby application debugging through both source code modification (binding.break) and external invocation (rdbg command), supporting modern development workflows including Rails applications, Rake tasks, and bundler-managed projects with thread and ractor debugging capabilities.
