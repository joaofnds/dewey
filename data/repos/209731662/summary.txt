`ruby/debug` is a Ruby library providing debugging functionality for Ruby (MRI) 2.7 and later, replacing the standard `lib/debug.rb`. It offers fast, extensible debugging capabilities, including remote debugging via UNIX domain sockets or TCP/IP, with integrations for VSCode and Chrome DevTools. Key features include breakpoint setting, expression evaluation, program flow control, tracing, and configuration options accessible through a command-line interface and a debugger API via `binding.break`. This is a developer productivity tool implemented as a Ruby library, aimed at Ruby developers for debugging and troubleshooting their applications.
