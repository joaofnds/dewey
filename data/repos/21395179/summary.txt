`limelight.vim` is a Vim plugin designed to enhance focus during writing by dimming surrounding text, creating a "hyperfocus" writing environment. It allows users to activate and configure the dimming effect on surrounding paragraphs, with options for color customization and paragraph selection. Written in Vim Script, the plugin integrates with the Goyo.vim plugin for a streamlined writing workflow and supports both 256-color terminals and GVim environments. It is primarily intended for Vim users seeking to improve their writing focus within the Vim editor.
