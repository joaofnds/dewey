limelight.vim is a Vim plugin written in Vim Script that provides hyperfocus writing functionality by dimming surrounding text paragraphs while highlighting the current paragraph or selected text range. Designed for the text editing and writing domain, it leverages Vim's syntax highlighting system and conceal features to create a "spotlight" effect that reduces visual distractions during writing sessions. The plugin calculates appropriate dimming colors based on the active color scheme, supports both terminal (256-color) and GUI Vim environments, and offers configurable opacity levels, paragraph span controls, and custom highlighting priorities. It integrates seamlessly with distraction-free writing environments, particularly Goyo.vim, and targets writers, developers, and content creators who use Vim as their primary text editor and need focused writing environments with minimal visual clutter.
