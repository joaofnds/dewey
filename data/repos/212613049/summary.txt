`gh`, GitHub's official command-line interface, provides a standalone tool for interacting with GitHub directly from the terminal, supplementing existing `git` workflows. Written in Go, it facilitates pull request and issue management, alongside other GitHub operations, directly within the developer's command line environment. The tool supports multiple operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux) and installation methods via package managers like Homebrew, WinGet, and Conda, streamlining developer productivity. This is a standalone CLI application designed for developers working with GitHub.
