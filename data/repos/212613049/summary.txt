GitHub CLI (`gh`) is an official command-line tool built in Go that provides terminal-based access to GitHub's platform functionality, integrating pull requests, issues, repositories, and other GitHub operations directly into developer workflows. Targeting the DevOps and software development domain, it leverages GitHub's REST and GraphQL APIs (v4) to enable Git repository management, CI/CD pipeline interactions, and collaborative development tasks without leaving the command line. The tool addresses the friction of context-switching between terminal-based Git operations and web-based GitHub interface interactions, streamlining developer productivity for software engineers, DevOps practitioners, and technical teams working with GitHub repositories. It supports cross-platform deployment across macOS, Windows, and Linux environments, integrating with GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server instances to provide unified command-line access to GitHub's ecosystem.
