**ray-so** is a TypeScript-based Next.js web application that provides a comprehensive suite of developer productivity tools for the Raycast ecosystem. The platform serves web developers and Raycast extension creators by offering multiple utilities including code snippet visualization (converting code into shareable images), AI prompt exploration and management, extension icon generation, theme customization, and quicklink management. Built with modern React/Next.js architecture, it addresses the fragmented workflow of developers who need to create visual code presentations, manage AI prompts, design extension assets, and customize their development environment. The application targets Raycast users specifically but appeals broadly to developers seeking integrated tools for code sharing, visual asset creation, and workflow optimization within a unified web interface.
