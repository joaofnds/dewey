Whistle is a configuration-driven web server framework built on top of the Toot HTTP library for Common Lisp applications. It serves as a higher-level abstraction layer that eliminates the need for custom code by providing declarative configuration files to handle common web server tasks including URL redirection, basic authentication enforcement, and pattern-based request routing to specific handler functions. Targeting web developers working in the Common Lisp ecosystem, Whistle addresses the complexity of manual HTTP request handling by offering a configuration-over-code approach for typical web server operations. The framework leverages Toot's low-level HTTP plumbing while providing administrators and Lisp developers with a more accessible interface for deploying and managing web applications without extensive programming overhead.
