NoiseTorch is a Linux audio processing application written in Go that implements real-time microphone noise suppression for desktop environments. It targets audio engineering and remote communication domains by creating virtual microphones through PulseAudio/PipeWire integration, leveraging Mozilla's RNNoise neural network library for acoustic noise reduction. The application addresses background noise elimination during voice calls, streaming, and recording by establishing filtered audio devices that applications can select as input sources. It features voice activity detection with configurable thresholds and provides both microphone input and headphone output filtering capabilities. The solution serves Linux system administrators, content creators, and remote workers who require clean audio input for conferencing applications like Discord, OBS, and Mumble without complex audio engineering knowledge or manual PulseAudio configuration.
