NoiseTorch-ng is a standalone, GUI application written in Go designed for real-time microphone noise suppression on Linux systems. It creates a virtual microphone, enabling users to filter audio input for applications like conferencing and VoIP, using the RNNoise noise reduction library. Key features include a two-click setup for the virtual microphone, voice activity detection, and output filtering capabilities, all packaged in a single, statically linked binary. This project focuses on the Linux audio domain, leveraging PulseAudio or PipeWire for audio input/output management and targets users seeking to improve audio quality within their applications.
