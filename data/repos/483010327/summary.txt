Mist is an HTTP server library written in Gleam that provides a functional programming interface for building web applications on the Erlang/OTP platform. It targets web developers seeking type-safe server-side solutions with modern functional programming paradigms. The library supports HTTP/HTTPS servers, WebSocket connections, request/response handling, chunked transfers, file serving, and streaming request bodies for handling large uploads without memory overflow. Built on Gleam's actor model and OTP supervision trees, it integrates with the gleam_http, gleam_otp, and gleam_erlang ecosystem for building concurrent, fault-tolerant web services. Mist addresses the need for robust HTTP servers in the Gleam ecosystem, offering developers an alternative to traditional Erlang/Elixir web frameworks while maintaining BEAM VM performance characteristics and reliability.
