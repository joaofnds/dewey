fastest-validator is a high-performance JavaScript schema validation library designed for Node.js, browser, and Deno environments targeting web developers who need efficient data validation. The library compiles validation schemas into optimized functions using the Function constructor, achieving over 8 million validations per second and claiming 50x faster performance than alternatives like Joi. It provides 20+ built-in validators, custom validation rules, nested object handling, sanitization capabilities, and programmable error handling without external dependencies. The library serves web application developers building APIs, form validation systems, and data processing pipelines where input validation performance is critical. It integrates with frameworks like Moleculer, Fastify, and Express, solving the bottleneck of runtime schema validation in high-throughput JavaScript applications through compile-time optimization strategies.
