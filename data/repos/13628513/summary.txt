Logrus is a structured logging library for Go applications that provides API compatibility with Go's standard library logger while adding structured logging capabilities. Targeted at Go developers across web development, microservices, and backend systems, it enables applications to output structured log data in JSON format for integration with log aggregation systems like Logstash, Splunk, and ELK stack. The library features pluggable formatters (JSON, text, logfmt), configurable log levels, custom fields, and hooks for external logging services. Currently in maintenance mode, Logrus solved the early need for structured logging in the Go ecosystem before newer alternatives like Zap and Zerolog emerged, making it suitable for existing Go applications requiring structured log output for observability and debugging purposes.
