BIRL (Bambam's "It's show time" Recursive Language) is a satirical programming language implementation that serves as the frontend documentation and web interface for a C-based compiled language. Built with JavaScript, this repository hosts the static website providing syntax documentation, tutorials, and language reference materials for BIRL, which appears to be a humorous take on traditional programming languages inspired by ArnoldC. The project targets recreational programmers and developers interested in esoteric programming languages, serving the educational and entertainment domain rather than production software development. The web interface connects to a separate compilation server, providing an online IDE experience for users to learn and experiment with this novelty programming language that parodies conventional C-style syntax with Brazilian Portuguese slang and bodybuilding references.
