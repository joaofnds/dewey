Transient is an Emacs Lisp library that implements keyboard-driven command interfaces for complex interactive operations within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. Originally developed for Magit (Git interface for Emacs), it provides a framework for creating modal menus that display argument states, manage keybindings, and compose multi-step interactive commands with persistent history. The library addresses the complexity of CLI program interactions by offering contextual UI elements that guide users through command options, boolean flags, and subcommands without requiring manual documentation lookup. Targeted at Emacs developers and power users, Transient enables the creation of sophisticated command interfaces that scale beyond simple prefix arguments, particularly useful for integrating external CLI tools and creating wizard-like workflows within the Emacs environment.
