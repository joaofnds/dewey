`Primes` is a benchmarking project focused on prime number sieves, offering performance comparisons across C#, C++, and C. It implements and tests prime-finding algorithms, with a core functionality being a "drag race" comparing the speed of different implementations. The project leverages Makefiles for building and running benchmarks, and results are visualized through the `PrimeView` web application. It is primarily an example/benchmark project for demonstrating and comparing the performance of prime number algorithms, targeted towards programmers interested in algorithm efficiency and language performance.
