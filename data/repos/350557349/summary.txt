This repository implements a cross-language prime number sieve benchmarking suite designed for performance comparison across multiple programming languages including C, C++, C#, and Python. The project serves the software performance engineering and benchmarking domain, providing standardized implementations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to measure computational performance differences between languages and optimization techniques. Built with Docker containerization, unified Makefile build system, and CI/CD automation, it targets software engineers, performance analysts, and programming language researchers conducting empirical performance studies. The repository addresses the need for standardized, reproducible benchmarks when evaluating language-specific performance characteristics for computational algorithms, with results visualization through a dedicated web application and automated benchmark execution infrastructure.
