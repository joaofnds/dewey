kube-prometheus is a Kubernetes-native monitoring stack built with Jsonnet that provides end-to-end cluster observability using Prometheus ecosystem components. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform administrators, it delivers a complete monitoring solution including Prometheus Operator, highly-available Prometheus and Alertmanager instances, Grafana dashboards, and essential exporters (node-exporter, blackbox-exporter, kube-state-metrics). The stack leverages Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and the Prometheus Adapter for metrics API integration, solving the complex problem of comprehensive Kubernetes cluster monitoring through pre-configured manifests, alerting rules, and visualization dashboards. Built for production environments, it monitors all Kubernetes components while providing extensible configuration through jsonnet templating, eliminating the manual complexity of deploying and maintaining distributed monitoring infrastructure across Kubernetes clusters.
