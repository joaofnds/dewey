kube-prometheus provides a comprehensive Kubernetes cluster monitoring solution leveraging Prometheus and the Prometheus Operator. It delivers pre-configured Prometheus instances, Alertmanager, node exporters, and Grafana, along with pre-built dashboards and alerting rules, all managed through Kubernetes custom resources defined in Jsonnet. This project functions as a package and library, providing easy-to-deploy manifests for monitoring Kubernetes components and applications. The architecture centers around the Prometheus Operator, simplifying the deployment and management of a highly-available monitoring stack, targeting system administrators and DevOps engineers responsible for cluster health and performance.
