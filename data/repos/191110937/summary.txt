Impersonator is a Ruby testing library that provides record-and-replay functionality for object method interactions, similar to VCR but for Ruby objects instead of HTTP requests. It addresses the complexity of creating elaborate stubs and mocks in test suites by automatically recording method invocations, arguments, return values, and yielded values during the first execution, then replaying these interactions in subsequent test runs. The library stores recordings in YAML format and offers configuration options for argument matching, method selection, and recording paths. Targeted at Ruby developers working on test automation, it's particularly useful for testing expensive service calls or complex object interactions where traditional mocking becomes brittle and difficult to maintain, enabling more reliable and maintainable test doubles.
