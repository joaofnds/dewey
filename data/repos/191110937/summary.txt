`Impersonator` is a Ruby library designed for recording and replaying object interactions, primarily for testing purposes. It enables developers to create and manage test doubles (mocks/stubs) by capturing method invocations, including arguments, return values, and yielded values, then reproducing these recorded interactions in subsequent test runs. Functionality mirrors VCR but for Ruby objects rather than HTTP requests, allowing for more robust and maintainable tests by reducing reliance on complex stubbing and expectation setup. This library is a Ruby gem for Ruby developers, supporting features such as custom recording paths, argument matching configuration, and integration with RSpec for automated test recording.
