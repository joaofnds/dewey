This Go library provides OAuth authentication capabilities specifically designed for command-line interface (CLI) applications that need to authorize against OAuth servers, primarily GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server instances. It implements both OAuth Device Authorization Grant flow and Web Application flow, automatically attempting device flow first with localhost server fallback for environments lacking device flow support. The library solves the redirect URI challenge inherent in CLI applications by presenting users with one-time codes for browser-based authorization or spawning a local HTTP server at 127.0.0.1 to handle OAuth callbacks. Targeted at Go developers building CLI tools and client applications, it enables seamless OAuth integration across different GitHub deployment scenarios while handling the complexity of headless and containerized environments where traditional web-based OAuth flows are impractical.
