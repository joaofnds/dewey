This repository serves as a comprehensive Common Lisp educational resource, functioning as a technical cheat sheet and tutorial collection for functional programming practitioners. Built primarily as HTML documentation, it systematically covers Common Lisp fundamentals including S-expressions, CLOS (Common Lisp Object System), macros, lambda functions, list processing, and functional programming paradigms. The content addresses core Lisp concepts such as defun/defvar definitions, setf operations, format functions, hash tables, sequence manipulation, and package management. Targeted at software developers, computer science students, and functional programming enthusiasts seeking to learn or reference Common Lisp syntax and idioms, the repository consolidates scattered online Lisp resources into a structured learning framework. It solves the problem of fragmented Common Lisp documentation by providing a centralized, example-driven reference guide covering everything from basic arithmetic operations to advanced topics like CLOS and file I/O operations.
