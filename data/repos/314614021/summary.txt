`lisp-notes` is an HTML-formatted tutorial and cheat sheet repository for Common Lisp, designed to aid in learning and referencing the language's core concepts. It covers fundamental aspects like global variables, functions, control structures (conditionals, loops), data structures (lists, hash tables), sequence operations, and object-oriented programming with CLOS. The resource serves as a practical guide for Lisp developers, showcasing examples and syntax for various language features, including lambda expressions, multiple values, and file I/O, organized in a structured, navigable format. It is an example/template project, and targets programmers new to Common Lisp.
