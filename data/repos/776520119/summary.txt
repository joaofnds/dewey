This JavaScript repository, ICEREG1992/pkmnmap4, offers an interactive map for the Pokémon Platinum game, providing detailed Item and Berry Locations. The core functionality lies in generating an interactive map using Leaflet, with data sourced from Bulbapedia and Techno Trainer's video series. The project leverages a custom script (ImageToTileset) for converting large PNG images into tilesets suitable for Leaflet rendering. This repository also includes tools for creating new maps, interiors, and regions, making it an essential resource for Pokémon Platinum map enthusiasts. The technology stack primarily consists of JavaScript, Leaflet, ImageMagick, Wand, and Python (for the custom script). As a web application, it caters to users interested in interactive mapping and data visualization within the Pokémon community.
