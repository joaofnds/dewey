This repository implements an interactive web-based map application for Pokémon Platinum using JavaScript and the Leaflet mapping library. Built for the gaming/fan community domain, it provides a comprehensive location reference tool displaying item and berry locations across the game world. The application features multi-zoom level tile-based maps generated from high-resolution images using Python scripts with ImageMagick and Wand for tile processing. Core functionality includes clickable regions, marker systems for items/locations, and map navigation between overworld and interior locations. The codebase includes helper tools for generating new tilesets from PNG images and coordinate translation utilities for creating interactive regions. Target users are Pokémon players seeking location references and developers interested in creating similar game mapping applications using web technologies.
