**Settings Sync** is a Visual Studio Code extension that synchronizes VS Code configurations across multiple machines using GitHub Gist as the storage backend. Built in TypeScript, it targets software developers and development teams who work across multiple workstations or collaborate on shared development environments. The extension automatically syncs user settings, keybindings, launch configurations, code snippets, installed extensions, extension configurations, and workspace folders through GitHub's Gist API. It provides automated upload/download functionality with keyboard shortcuts, auto-sync on file changes, startup synchronization, and GitHub Enterprise support. The tool solves the common developer workflow problem of maintaining consistent IDE configurations across different development environments, eliminating manual reconfiguration when switching between machines or onboarding new team members.
