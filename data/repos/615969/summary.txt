The Racket repository contains the core implementation and source code for the Racket programming language, a Lisp-based general-purpose language designed for language-oriented programming and domain-specific language (DSL) creation. Built primarily in Racket itself with C components for the runtime system, it targets programming language researchers, educators, and developers who need to create custom languages or work with symbolic computation, macros, and metaprogramming. The language emphasizes syntax extension, contract systems, and functional programming paradigms, serving academic computer science education, research in programming language design, and applications requiring rapid prototyping of domain-specific syntaxes. Racket's ecosystem supports web development, GUI applications, and scripting, but its primary strength lies in language construction and educational programming environments where users need powerful macro systems and language experimentation capabilities.
