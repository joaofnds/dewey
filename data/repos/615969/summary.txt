The `racket/racket` repository houses the core source code for the Racket programming language and its associated ecosystem. It provides the foundational components for language-oriented programming, including a compiler, runtime environment, and related packages. Written in Racket, this project is a language implementation, a core component of the overall Racket distribution, and a development resource for those contributing to the Racket language and its ecosystem. The repository offers build instructions and contributes to the wider development environment through community forums and contribution guidelines.
