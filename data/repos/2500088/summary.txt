GitLab is a comprehensive DevOps platform built with Ruby on Rails that provides Git repository management, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, code review workflows, and project collaboration tools. The application targets software development teams and DevOps engineers, offering both self-hosted and cloud-based solutions for managing the complete software development lifecycle. Built on a stack including Ruby 3.2.5, PostgreSQL 14.9+, Redis 6.0+, and Git 2.33+, GitLab addresses the problem of fragmented development toolchains by consolidating version control, issue tracking, merge requests, automated testing, and deployment automation into a single integrated platform. The open-source Community Edition serves developers and organizations seeking an alternative to distributed DevOps tooling.
