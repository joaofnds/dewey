emacs-neotree is an Emacs Lisp plugin that implements a hierarchical file tree explorer for the Emacs text editor, functionally equivalent to Vim's NerdTree plugin. Targeting software developers and system administrators who use Emacs for code editing and project management, it provides a sidebar interface for navigating filesystem structures with keyboard shortcuts for common file operations including creation, deletion, renaming, and copying. The plugin integrates with Emacs' buffer system and offers multiple visual themes (classic, ascii, arrow, icons, nerd-icons) with support for icon fonts through all-the-icons and nerd-icons packages. It addresses the need for efficient project navigation within Emacs workflows, eliminating the need to switch between editor and external file managers during development tasks.
