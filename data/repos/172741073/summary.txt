Snowpack is a frontend build tool for web development that leverages JavaScript's native ES modules (ESM) to provide unbundled development workflows. It serves as a lightweight alternative to traditional bundlers like webpack and Parcel, offering a development server with sub-50ms startup times and instant hot module replacement for browser updates. The tool supports TypeScript, JSX, CSS Modules out-of-the-box and integrates with production bundlers through a plugin system. Targeted at frontend developers and web development teams, Snowpack addresses the performance bottlenecks of traditional bundled development environments by serving individual modules directly to the browser during development, eliminating the need for rebundling on code changes. Note that the project is no longer actively maintained as of April 2022.
