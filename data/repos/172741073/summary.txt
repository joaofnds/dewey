Snowpack is a frontend build tool designed for rapid web development, leveraging JavaScript's native module system (ESM) to provide instant, unbundled development. Its key features include a fast development server, instant browser updates via hot module replacement, and integration with bundlers for production builds. The tool supports TypeScript, JSX, CSS Modules, and utilizes third-party plugins for extensibility. This is a standalone developer productivity tool, targeted at frontend developers seeking a faster alternative to traditional bundlers like webpack and Parcel.
