Minitest is a lightweight Ruby testing framework that provides a complete suite of testing facilities for Ruby developers, supporting Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), mocking, and performance benchmarking. Built for the Ruby ecosystem, it offers four core modules: minitest/test for fast unit testing with assertion-based syntax, minitest/spec for RSpec-style behavior specifications, minitest/mock for test doubles and stubbing, and minitest/benchmark for algorithmic performance validation. The framework emphasizes simplicity and speed over feature complexity, leveraging Ruby's native object-oriented constructs rather than custom DSLs, making it particularly suitable for Ruby application developers, gem authors, and teams seeking minimal dependencies while maintaining comprehensive testing capabilities across web applications, libraries, and Ruby-based software projects.
