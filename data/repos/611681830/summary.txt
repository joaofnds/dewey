org-tufte is an Emacs Lisp package that extends Org Mode's HTML export functionality to generate Tufte-style web pages with a single command. Built for the academic writing and technical documentation domain, it leverages Org Mode's existing export system while integrating Tufte CSS framework, KaTeX for mathematical rendering, and responsive design principles. The package solves compatibility issues between standard org-exported HTML templates and Tufte CSS, while adding mobile responsiveness and self-contained HTML generation through image embedding. It targets Emacs users, researchers, and technical writers who want to create elegant, readable web documents from Org Mode files without complex configuration, providing features like syntax highlighting with et-book-ligatures font, margin notes for figure captions, and customizable export options through a simplified interface.
