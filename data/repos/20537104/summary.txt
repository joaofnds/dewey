Cayley is an open-source, Go-based graph database designed for managing and querying linked data, inspired by Google's Knowledge Graph. It offers multiple query languages, including Gizmo (Gremlin-inspired), GraphQL-inspired, and MQL, facilitating diverse query patterns. Key features include a built-in query editor, visualizer, and REPL.  The project is a standalone application, production-ready and optimized for high-performance graph traversal and data retrieval.  Its focus on linked data and graph-based querying distinguishes it from relational database systems.
