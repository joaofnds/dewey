Cayley is an open-source graph database written in Go, designed for storing and querying Linked Data and semantic web datasets. Targeting data engineers, backend developers, and organizations working with knowledge graphs, it provides multiple query interfaces including Gizmo (Gremlin-inspired), GraphQL-like syntax, and MQL for Freebase compatibility. The database features modular backend storage support (including LevelDB), built-in query visualization tools, and a REPL environment for interactive graph exploration. Inspired by Google's Knowledge Graph architecture, Cayley addresses the need for scalable RDF triple/quad storage and complex graph traversal queries, particularly suited for applications requiring semantic data relationships, linked data processing, and knowledge management systems where traditional relational databases fall short.
