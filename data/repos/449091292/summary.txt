PRQL is a modern query language implemented in Rust that serves as a SQL replacement for data transformation workflows. It targets data analysts, data scientists, and database developers who work with relational databases and need more intuitive query composition. The language features a pipelined syntax that compiles to standard SQL, enabling use with existing database infrastructure while providing enhanced readability and logical flow compared to traditional SQL. PRQL supports advanced features like variables, functions, date literals, and F-string interpolation, addressing the complexity and verbosity issues inherent in SQL query construction. The project includes language bindings, integrations with data tools, and a web-based playground for testing queries.
