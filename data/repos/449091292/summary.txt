PRQL is a modern language designed to replace SQL for data transformation, enabling a pipelined, readable, and declarative approach. Built in Rust, it compiles PRQL queries into SQL for execution against SQL databases. Key features include support for variables, functions, and a logical pipeline of transformations. The project is a compiler and associated tools (CLI, bindings) with a web-based playground and documentation, intended for data engineers and analysts seeking a more user-friendly alternative to traditional SQL syntax.
