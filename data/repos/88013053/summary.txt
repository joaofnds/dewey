The Docker CLI repository contains the official command-line interface for Docker, implemented in Go. This tool serves as the primary user interface for interacting with Docker Engine, enabling containerization operations including image building, container lifecycle management, network configuration, and volume orchestration. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and software developers, it provides essential commands like `docker run`, `docker build`, `docker push`, and `docker compose` for container-based application deployment and infrastructure management. The CLI communicates with Docker daemon via REST API, supporting cross-platform builds through Docker Buildx integration and multi-architecture container operations. Built using Docker's own containerized development workflow, it addresses the core problem of providing a consistent, scriptable interface for Docker's container platform across Linux, Windows, and macOS environments.
