The `docker/cli` repository provides the command-line interface (CLI) for Docker, a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Developed in Go, the CLI allows users to build, manage, and orchestrate Docker containers and images. Key functionalities include building images via `docker buildx bake`, managing platform-specific builds, running linting and tests, and interacting with the Docker daemon. This is a standalone CLI application designed for system administrators and developers working with containerized applications.
