Sonic is a high-performance JSON serialization and deserialization library for Go applications, targeting web developers and backend engineers who require fast JSON processing in distributed systems, APIs, and data-intensive services. Built with JIT (just-in-time) compilation and SIMD (single-instruction-multiple-data) optimizations, it significantly outperforms Go's standard `encoding/json` library across all payload sizes. The library provides complete APIs for JSON manipulation, runtime object binding without code generation, and streaming I/O support for handling large datasets with reduced memory consumption. Sonic addresses performance bottlenecks in JSON-heavy applications like web services, microservices, and real-time data processing systems where serialization speed directly impacts throughput and latency.
