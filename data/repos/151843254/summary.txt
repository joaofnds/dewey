`rrweb` is a TypeScript library for recording and replaying user interactions on the web, targeting the session replay domain. It captures DOM mutations and user events, enabling the reconstruction of user sessions. The project provides core functionalities through its `record` and `replay` modules, along with a UI player. Its architecture includes `rrweb-snapshot` for DOM serialization and rebuilding, and `rrweb-player` for a GUI. This is a JavaScript library primarily for frontend developers building web applications.
