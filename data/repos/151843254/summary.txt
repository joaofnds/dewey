rrweb is a TypeScript-based web session recording and replay library designed for the web analytics and user experience monitoring domain. It provides developers with tools to capture, serialize, and reconstruct DOM mutations and user interactions on web pages, enabling pixel-perfect session replay functionality similar to commercial products like FullStory, Hotjar, and LogRocket. The library consists of three core components: rrweb-snapshot for DOM serialization and reconstruction, rrweb for recording/replaying mutations with timestamps, and rrweb-player for playback UI controls. It targets frontend developers, UX researchers, and product teams who need to implement session replay capabilities for debugging, user behavior analysis, and customer support workflows in web applications.
