Human Interval is a JavaScript parsing library that converts natural language time expressions into millisecond values for Node.js applications. Targeting web developers and backend engineers, it processes English phrases like "three minutes," "2 days and 4 hours," or "twenty-five seconds" into numeric intervals suitable for JavaScript timing functions like setTimeout() and setInterval(). The library leverages node-numbered for text-to-number conversion and supports various time units (seconds through years), written numbers, hyphenated numbers, and negative values. Primarily used by job scheduling frameworks like Agenda and Bree, it solves the problem of making cron jobs and task scheduling more human-readable and developer-friendly in server-side JavaScript applications, eliminating the need for manual millisecond calculations in timing-dependent code.
