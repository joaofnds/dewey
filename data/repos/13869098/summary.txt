`human-interval` is a JavaScript library designed to parse human-readable time intervals expressed in English into numerical values, primarily for use in job scheduling and time-based operations. It supports various time units (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years), wordy and hyphenated numbers, and negative time intervals. Utilizing the `node-numbered` library, this library is intended for use in Node.js environments, functioning as a developer productivity tool to simplify the conversion of natural language time expressions into actionable time values.
