`biolab/orange3` is a Python-based, interactive data analysis and visualization toolbox designed for both novice and expert users. It enables visual programming workflows for data mining tasks including classification, clustering, regression, and data visualization, integrating libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and SciPy.  The project is a standalone GUI application that provides a suite of widgets for building data analysis pipelines. The architecture centers on a core canvas and widget system, allowing extensibility through add-ons, with specific emphasis on visual exploration of data without requiring programming expertise.
