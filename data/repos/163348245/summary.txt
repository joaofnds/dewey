This repository serves as a comprehensive academic literature collection and reference guide for resilience engineering research, specifically curated for software engineering and systems operations practitioners. It functions as a structured bibliography organizing influential papers, researchers, and core concepts from resilience engineering, cognitive systems engineering, and naturalistic decision-making fields. The repository targets DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers, system architects, and software developers seeking to apply resilience engineering principles to distributed systems, incident response, and operational safety. Key focus areas include adaptive capacity, graceful degradation, STAMP (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model), Safety-II methodologies, and drift-into-failure patterns. The collection bridges academic safety science research with practical software systems engineering, providing annotated references to foundational works by researchers like David Woods, Erik Hollnagel, Sidney Dekker, and Nancy Leveson for building more resilient software systems and operational practices.
