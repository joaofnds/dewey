The `lorin/resilience-engineering` repository serves as a curated collection of resources centered on resilience engineering, cognitive systems engineering, and related human factors. It primarily functions as a reference library, aggregating papers, publications, talks, and notes on influential researchers and practitioners in these fields, including materials from John Allspaw, David Woods, Sidney Dekker, and others. This project organizes information from diverse sources like blogs, academic publications, and video presentations, promoting knowledge sharing within the domain of safety and system performance in complex socio-technical systems, and features links to external resources such as the Resilience in Software Foundation. It appears to be a research artifact and resource for individuals and organizations in areas like software development and operations.
