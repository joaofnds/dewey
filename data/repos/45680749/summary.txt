OSX-KVM is a virtualization solution that enables running macOS operating systems (Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma) on Linux hosts using QEMU/KVM hypervisor technology without requiring physical Mac hardware. Built primarily in Python with OpenCore bootloader integration, it creates "Virtual Hackintosh" systems for developers and system administrators needing macOS environments for cross-platform development, testing, or iOS/macOS application development. The project addresses hardware independence for macOS virtualization by providing automated installation scripts, macOS installer fetching utilities, and QEMU configuration management. It targets DevOps engineers, mobile developers, and system administrators who require macOS environments for CI/CD pipelines, software testing, or development workflows but lack access to Apple hardware, supporting both local and cloud deployment scenarios.
