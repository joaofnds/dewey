`OSX-KVM` provides a Python-based set of scripts and configuration files enabling users to virtualize macOS on QEMU/KVM within a Linux environment. It facilitates the installation and operation of various macOS versions, including Monterey, Ventura, and Sonoma, by automating and streamlining the process of creating a "Virtual Hackintosh." Key functionalities include automating macOS installation, supporting headless operation, and offering guidance on networking and GPU passthrough. The project is a collection of scripts and configuration files designed to enable macOS virtualization, with a focus on kernel debugging, building, and testing, and the primary target audience is likely system administrators, security researchers, and developers interested in operating macOS within a virtualized environment.
