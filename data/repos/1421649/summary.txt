Doric is a Clojure library for rendering tabular data from nested collections into formatted text tables suitable for console output or documentation. It targets Clojure developers who need to display structured data in human-readable formats, particularly for CLI tools, REPL interactions, and data analysis workflows. The library transforms maps and collections into ASCII tables with customizable column alignment, width, formatting functions, and output formats including emacs org-mode tables (default), CSV, HTML, and raw text. It provides fine-grained control over table presentation through column specifications, automatic sizing, text alignment options, and custom formatting functions like bar charts for data visualization. Doric solves the common problem of presenting tabular data elegantly in text-based environments where developers need structured output from database queries, API responses, or analytical computations.
