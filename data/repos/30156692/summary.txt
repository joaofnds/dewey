Amp is a terminal-based text editor written in Rust that implements a simplified Vi/Vim interaction model for command-line text editing workflows. Built on the separate Scribe crate for core functionality like data structures and syntax highlighting, it targets developers, system administrators, and DevOps professionals who require efficient text editing capabilities within terminal environments. The editor addresses the need for a modern, lightweight alternative to traditional terminal editors while maintaining familiar modal editing paradigms from Vim. Amp serves the software development and system administration domains by providing essential text editing features optimized for terminal-based workflows, particularly benefiting users working in remote environments, containers, or headless systems where GUI editors are unavailable.
