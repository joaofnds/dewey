`amp` is a terminal-based text editor inspired by Vim, providing core editing functionalities for developers. Built in Rust, it aims for a simplified Vim-like interaction model while integrating essential features for modern text editing.  The editor leverages a separate crate, `scribe`, for internal components like data structures, syntax highlighting, and workspace management. This standalone application, targeted at developers, offers a command-line interface for text manipulation within a terminal environment.
