gh-ost is a triggerless online schema migration tool for MySQL databases, developed by GitHub and written in Go. It enables database administrators and DevOps engineers to perform live schema changes on production MySQL tables without blocking operations or using database triggers. The tool creates a ghost table, uses MySQL's binary log stream to capture and apply changes asynchronously, and provides features like pausability, throttling, and replica testing. Unlike traditional schema migration tools that rely on triggers, gh-ost decouples migration workload from production traffic, offering dynamic control, auditing capabilities, and the ability to test migrations on replicas before applying to master databases, making it particularly valuable for high-availability MySQL environments.
