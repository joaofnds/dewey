Iota is an LLVM-to-Common Lisp transpiler that converts LLVM bitcode into safe, portable Common Lisp code, functioning similarly to Emscripten but targeting Lisp instead of JavaScript. The system enables compilation of C/C++ programs through Clang to LLVM bitcode, then translates the intermediate representation into executable Common Lisp code. Built in C and integrating with the LLVM toolchain, Iota includes examples of complex applications like Doom (prboom) and Quake (sdlquake) running natively in Lisp environments. This tool primarily serves systems programmers, Lisp developers, and researchers working on language interoperability who need to port existing C codebases to Common Lisp runtime environments while maintaining performance and compatibility with legacy applications.
