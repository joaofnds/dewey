`Iota` is an LLVM to Common Lisp transpiler, enabling the conversion of LLVM intermediate representation code into Common Lisp source code. This project allows developers to utilize the LLVM compiler infrastructure for generating code and then translate it for execution in the Common Lisp environment. The core functionality centers on source-to-source compilation, facilitating interoperability between LLVM-based systems and Common Lisp. As a transpiler, `Iota` likely presents itself as a developer productivity tool that addresses the task of bridging the gap between these distinct code paradigms.
