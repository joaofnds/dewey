`godbolt.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that displays assembly code generated from a buffer or visual selection using the Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org) service or a user-specified instance. Written in Fennel, it leverages the Neovim API to interact with the editor, supporting custom compiler selection, integration with fuzzy finders like Telescope and FZF, and quickfix error reporting. The plugin enhances developer productivity by providing an integrated assembly code view directly within the Neovim environment, primarily targeting developers working with compiled languages and assembly analysis.
