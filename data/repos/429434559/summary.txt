godbolt.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Fennel that integrates with the Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org) service to display assembly output for source code directly within the editor. Targeting systems programmers and compiler engineers, it supports multiple programming languages including C, C++, and Rust, allowing developers to compile code snippets or entire buffers using various compilers and view the resulting assembly code in real-time. The plugin leverages Neovim's 0.7+ API features, provides syntax highlighting for assembly output, supports visual selection compilation, integrates with fuzzy finders (telescope, fzf), and includes quickfix list population for compiler errors. This tool addresses the common need for low-level optimization analysis and compiler behavior understanding in performance-critical development workflows.
