GraphQLize is a Clojure-based JVM library that automatically generates GraphQL APIs from existing PostgreSQL and MySQL database schemas using JDBC metadata introspection. Targeting backend developers in web development, it eliminates manual GraphQL schema definition and resolver implementation by dynamically creating type-safe GraphQL endpoints that map directly to database tables and relationships. The library integrates with multiple JVM frameworks including Spring Boot, Spark Java, Pedestal, Ring, and Ktor, supporting Java, Kotlin, Clojure, and Scala applications. Built on Lacinia for GraphQL processing, it addresses the time-intensive process of building database-backed GraphQL APIs while handling query optimization to prevent N+1 problems, serving as a low-code/RAD solution for rapid API development in enterprise and web application contexts.
