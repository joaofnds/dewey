GraphQLize is a Clojure library designed to instantly generate GraphQL APIs from existing PostgreSQL and MySQL databases. It leverages JDBC metadata to automatically create GraphQL schemas and resolvers, simplifying the development of GraphQL endpoints and reducing manual schema definition and database access logic. Supporting various JVM frameworks such as Spring Boot, Ring, and Pedestal, this library aims to accelerate GraphQL API development by abstracting away complexities related to schema generation and database interaction for Java Virtual Machine (JVM) developers. As a library, it facilitates the creation of GraphQL servers for relational databases.
