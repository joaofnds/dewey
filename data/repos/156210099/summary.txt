Broadway is an Elixir framework for building concurrent, multi-stage data ingestion and processing pipelines, built on top of GenStage and the Erlang VM's actor model. It targets backend developers and data engineers working with real-time streaming data from sources like Amazon SQS, Apache Kafka, Google Cloud PubSub, and RabbitMQ. The framework abstracts away complex GenStage topology configuration, providing automatic back-pressure handling, batching, fault tolerance, acknowledgements, and graceful shutdown capabilities. Broadway is designed for long-running, production-grade data pipelines that require high concurrency and operational robustness, offering built-in metrics, rate limiting, and custom failure handling for enterprise-scale event processing and ETL workloads.
