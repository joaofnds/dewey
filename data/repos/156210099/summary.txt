`Broadway` is an Elixir library designed for building concurrent and multi-stage data ingestion and processing pipelines. It provides a configuration-driven API for efficiently consuming data from various sources, including Amazon SQS, Apache Kafka, and RabbitMQ, leveraging the Erlang VM's concurrency features. Key functionalities include back-pressure, automatic acknowledgements, batching, fault tolerance, and custom failure handling within long-running pipelines. This project is a library aimed at Elixir developers building data-intensive applications.
