Haskle is a browser-based educational game built with Elm that challenges Haskell developers to identify functions from their obfuscated type signatures, similar to Wordle mechanics. The application runs entirely client-side, presenting players with partially hidden Haskell type signatures that gradually reveal themselves with each incorrect guess, eventually showing the function name. It targets functional programming education and Haskell learning, defaulting to Prelude functions but supporting extensible function sets including lens operators and traversal functions. The game serves Haskell developers and students seeking to improve their type signature recognition skills and deepen their understanding of the Haskell ecosystem through gamified learning, requiring only Elm 0.19 for local development.
