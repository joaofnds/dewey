`Haskle` is a web-based word game, inspired by Wordle, where the player guesses Haskell functions based on their obfuscated types. The game reveals function signatures progressively, starting with the type, and gradually revealing the function name. Built as a client-side application, it primarily utilizes the Elm programming language, with potential for expansion through user-contributed function sets. The core functionality focuses on presenting type-based challenges derived from the Haskell prelude and other select function collections. This is a standalone web application.
