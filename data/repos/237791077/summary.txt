Diagrams is a Python library that enables programmatic generation of cloud system architecture diagrams using code instead of traditional design tools. Built on Graphviz for rendering, it supports major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes) and infrastructure components, allowing DevOps engineers and system architects to create visual representations of distributed systems through Python scripts. The library addresses the need for version-controllable, reproducible architecture documentation by treating diagrams as code artifacts that can be tracked in Git repositories. It targets infrastructure teams, cloud architects, and platform engineers who need to prototype, document, or visualize complex multi-cloud deployments and microservice architectures without manual diagramming tools, integrating seamlessly into Infrastructure-as-Code workflows.
