This repository contains educational Python code samples accompanying Michael Nielsen's book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning," providing hands-on implementations of fundamental deep learning concepts and algorithms. Targeting the machine learning and data science domain, the codebase uses Python 2.6/2.7 with Theano 0.6-0.7 for tensor operations and neural network computations. The primary purpose is pedagogical, offering practical examples of neural network architectures, backpropagation algorithms, and deep learning techniques to help students and practitioners understand the mathematical foundations and implementation details of artificial neural networks. The code serves data scientists, machine learning engineers, and computer science students seeking to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical implementation skills in deep learning fundamentals.
