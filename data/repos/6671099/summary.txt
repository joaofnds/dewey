This repository provides Python code samples accompanying the book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning." The code implements neural network algorithms, serving as practical examples for learning and experimentation within the domain of machine learning. Written primarily for Python 2.6 or 2.7, the project exemplifies machine learning concepts and implementation techniques using a specific, now-legacy, Python environment, with compatibility discussions with the Theano library. This resource functions as an example project and a learning aid for individuals studying neural networks.
