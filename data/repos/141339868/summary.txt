Pebble is a key-value store database library written in Go, inspired by RocksDB and LevelDB, designed for high-performance internal use within CockroachDB. It provides block-based tables, snapshots, range deletion tombstones, and supports features like prefix iteration and table-level bloom filters, focusing on efficient storage and retrieval. Pebble's architecture is built around the RocksDB file format and offers various improvements over RocksDB, including faster reverse iteration and a more efficient commit pipeline. It is a production-ready library that provides compatibility with RocksDB and can be used as a drop-in storage engine, targeting database developers building distributed systems that require robust data persistence.
