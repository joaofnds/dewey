Pebble is a high-performance, embedded key-value database engine written in Go, designed as a RocksDB/LevelDB alternative specifically for distributed database systems. Targeting database engineers and systems developers, it serves as the storage engine for CockroachDB and focuses on LSM-tree architecture with block-based tables, level-based compaction, and advanced features like range deletion tombstones, indexed batches, and block-property filters. The engine implements optimizations including L0 sublevels, faster reverse iteration through skiplist backwards links, concurrent compaction pipelines, and seamless batch iteration merging. Pebble addresses the need for a Go-native storage engine with simplified codebase compared to RocksDB while maintaining compatibility with RocksDB file formats, primarily serving distributed SQL databases and high-throughput transactional workloads requiring consistent low-latency storage operations.
