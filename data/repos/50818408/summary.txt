AdNauseam is a JavaScript-based browser extension built on uBlock Origin that implements adversarial obfuscation techniques to combat advertising surveillance networks. It operates in the web privacy and digital rights domain, functioning as both an ad-blocker and active defense mechanism by silently simulating clicks on blocked advertisements to poison tracking profiles. The extension leverages browser extension APIs across Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Opera to intercept ad requests, block display, and generate synthetic interaction data. It addresses the privacy engineering problem of behavioral tracking and profiling by advertising networks through data obfuscation rather than passive blocking. The tool targets privacy-conscious end users, digital rights advocates, and researchers working on privacy-enhancing technologies and adversarial machine learning countermeasures.
