`rjsx-mode` is an Emacs major mode designed to enhance the editing experience for JSX files. It extends `js2-mode` to provide syntax highlighting, indentation, and parsing support specifically for JSX syntax, enabling proper handling of JSX constructs not supported by the standard `js2-mode` parser. Key features include correct indentation, highlighting of JSX tags and attributes, and improved support for JSX-specific constructs like the spread operator, conditional expressions, and element completion shortcuts. This project is a plugin/extension for the Emacs text editor, aimed at frontend developers and Emacs users working with JavaScript and React/JSX.
