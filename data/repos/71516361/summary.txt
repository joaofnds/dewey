**rjsx-mode** is an Emacs major mode specifically designed for editing JSX files in React-based web development workflows. Built as an extension of js2-mode, it implements a custom parser that handles JSX syntax according to Facebook's official specification, providing accurate syntax highlighting, indentation, and error checking for JavaScript files containing JSX markup. The mode addresses the limitation where js2-mode's E4X parser fails to properly handle JSX constructs, offering features like automatic tag completion, spread operator support, conditional rendering syntax, and proper AST integration. Target users are frontend developers and React engineers who use Emacs as their primary editor and need robust tooling for JSX development, eliminating syntax errors and improving code readability in mixed JavaScript/JSX codebases.
