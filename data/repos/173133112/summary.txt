PROXX is a browser-based minesweeper-style proximity game built by Google Chrome Labs to demonstrate progressive web app capabilities across diverse devices, including feature phones. The TypeScript application utilizes Preact for UI components, PostCSS for styling, and Rollup for bundling, with a service-worker architecture for offline functionality. It implements dual rendering engines (WebGL and Canvas 2D) with motion/no-motion animation modes, stores generated sprites in IndexedDB for performance optimization, and runs game logic in web workers to maintain main thread responsiveness. The project targets web developers interested in cross-device compatibility, progressive enhancement, and performance optimization techniques for resource-constrained environments, showcasing modern web platform capabilities for universal device support.
