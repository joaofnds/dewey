This repository provides a web-based layout configurator for the Anne Pro 2 keyboard, enabling users to customize key mappings beyond the capabilities of the official ObinsKit application.  Built with HTML, it allows users to select keyboard layers, assign key codes to individual keys, and export the configuration for import into the Anne Pro 2's firmware. The project facilitates custom keyboard layout configuration, leveraging the existing firmware for key remapping, and is a standalone web application designed for Anne Pro 2 keyboard owners. The configurator is constrained by the Anne Pro 2 firmware's limitations.
