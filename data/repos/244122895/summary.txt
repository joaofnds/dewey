This repository provides a web-based keyboard layout configuration tool specifically designed for the Anne Pro 2 mechanical keyboard, targeting the hardware peripherals and custom input device domain. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a client-side web application, it serves as an alternative to the official ObinsKit firmware configuration software, offering enhanced flexibility and support for additional key mappings. The tool allows users to configure multiple keyboard layers, assign custom key codes using HID USB keyboard usage standards, and export configuration files compatible with the original ObinsKit firmware (tested on version 1.14.2-alpha). It addresses the limitation of the official configuration software by providing more comprehensive key customization options for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, hobbyists, and users seeking advanced keyboard layout personalization beyond standard manufacturer tools.
