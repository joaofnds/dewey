eqMac is a system-wide audio equalizer and volume mixer application for macOS that provides real-time audio processing capabilities. Built with Swift for the native backend and Angular/TypeScript for the web-based UI, it leverages Core Audio frameworks and AVAudioEngine to intercept and modify system audio streams. The application includes a custom Audio Server Driver Plug-in written in Swift that creates a secure user-space audio loopback device, replacing traditional kernel-based solutions like SoundFlower. It targets audio enthusiasts and professionals who need granular control over system audio output, offering features like multi-band EQ, volume boosting, per-application volume mixing, and AudioUnit hosting. The hybrid architecture enables over-the-air updates through its remotely hosted Angular interface while maintaining low-latency audio processing through native Core Audio integration.
