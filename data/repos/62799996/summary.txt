Flux Legacy (v1) is a deprecated continuous delivery solution for Kubernetes, operating in the cloud-native application deployment domain. It enabled GitOps practices, automating deployments via reconciliation of Kubernetes resources based on Git repository states. Built in Go, this project served as an early implementation of GitOps principles. It is superseded by fluxcd/flux2, a more modern and feature-rich implementation of the same core functionality. This project is a standalone application focused on automating Kubernetes deployments.
