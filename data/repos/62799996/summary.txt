Flux v1 is a legacy GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes clusters, written in Go, that automatically synchronizes application deployments with Git repository states. Operating in the DevOps/platform engineering domain, it enables declarative infrastructure management by monitoring Git repositories for configuration changes and automatically applying them to Kubernetes clusters. The monolithic architecture has been superseded by Flux v2, which redesigned the system using Kubernetes controller runtime and Custom Resource Definitions with a modular GitOps Toolkit approach. Originally developed by Weaveworks and later donated to CNCF, Flux v1 targeted platform engineers, DevOps teams, and system administrators seeking automated, Git-driven deployment workflows for containerized applications, but has reached end-of-life status with migration to v2 strongly recommended.
