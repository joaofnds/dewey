This Emacs Lisp package provides string case conversion utilities for developers working with multiple programming languages within the Emacs editor. It enables cycling between different naming conventions (underscore_case, UPPER_CASE, CamelCase, kebab-case) through keyboard shortcuts, with language-specific conversion patterns for Ruby, Python, Java, Elixir, and Emacs Lisp. The package addresses the common developer need to quickly transform variable and function names between different case formats when working across codebases with varying naming conventions. It integrates directly into Emacs major modes, allowing context-aware transformations based on the current programming language, and supports both point-based word conversion and region-based bulk transformations. Target users are software developers using Emacs as their primary IDE who frequently work with multi-language codebases requiring consistent identifier naming patterns.
