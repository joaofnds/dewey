Sequel is a comprehensive Ruby database toolkit that provides both low-level SQL query construction and high-level ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities for web developers and Ruby application developers. It abstracts database interactions through a chainable DSL for building SQL queries, handles connection pooling, thread safety, and supports advanced database features like prepared statements, transactions, and database sharding. The library includes adapters for major databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, and others, enabling cross-database compatibility. Sequel addresses the complexity of database integration in Ruby applications by providing both dataset-based query building and ActiveRecord-style object mapping, making it suitable for web development, data processing applications, and any Ruby project requiring robust database connectivity and manipulation capabilities.
