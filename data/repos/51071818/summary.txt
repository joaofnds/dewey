`diff-so-fancy` is a Perl script designed to enhance the readability of `git diff` output, transforming machine-readable diffs into a more human-friendly format. It improves code quality by aiding in quicker defect detection through features like color-coding, improved highlighting, and customizable output formatting, specifically aimed at making diffs easier to understand. Users integrate the script into their Git configuration to replace the default pager or use it directly with the `diff` command. It is a command-line tool and plugin, and targets developers using Git for version control.
