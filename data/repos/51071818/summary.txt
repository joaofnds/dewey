diff-so-fancy is a Perl-based Git diff enhancement tool designed for software developers and DevOps professionals to improve code review workflows. It transforms machine-readable Git diff output into human-readable format by applying syntax highlighting, removing clutter symbols, reformatting hunk headers, and adding visual separators with Unicode/ASCII rulers. The tool integrates seamlessly with Git's core.pager and interactive.diffFilter configurations, supports standard Unix diff command piping, and provides customizable color schemes for added/removed code sections. It addresses the core problem of poor readability in default Git diff output, enabling faster defect detection and improved code quality assessment during version control operations across development teams.
