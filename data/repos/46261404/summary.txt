Reason is a programming language implementation that provides an alternative syntax for OCaml, specifically designed to bridge functional programming with JavaScript ecosystem development. Built in OCaml, it serves web developers who want to leverage OCaml's strong type system and functional programming features while maintaining interoperability with JavaScript toolchains and libraries. The language compiles to both native OCaml bytecode and JavaScript, enabling developers to write type-safe, functional code that can run in browsers or Node.js environments. Reason targets frontend and full-stack JavaScript developers seeking the benefits of static typing, pattern matching, and functional programming paradigms without abandoning the JavaScript ecosystem. The project includes a formatter (refmt) and integrates with modern JavaScript build tools, positioning itself as a practical alternative to TypeScript for developers preferring ML-family language syntax and semantics.
