Reason is a programming language that facilitates the creation of type-safe, performant code by leveraging the JavaScript and OCaml ecosystems. It provides a bridge between these ecosystems, enabling developers to write code that can be compiled to JavaScript or native code. The project serves as a programming language focused on simplicity and speed, while integrating with existing JavaScript and OCaml tooling and libraries. It's geared toward developers seeking a type-safe alternative to JavaScript or a modern approach to OCaml development.
