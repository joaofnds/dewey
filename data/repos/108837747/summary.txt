Bibata_Cursor is an open-source cursor theme project for Linux and Windows desktop environments, built using Shell scripts and SVG graphics. The repository provides a comprehensive cursor set with material design principles, offering 12 variants across three color schemes (Amber, Classic, Ice) with both sharp and rounded edge styles, plus right-handed alternatives. It targets system administrators, Linux enthusiasts, and desktop customization users who want to replace default system cursors with professionally designed alternatives. The project uses TOML configuration files for cross-platform builds, supports multiple cursor sizes (16-80px for X11, 24-48px for Windows), and integrates with Linux package managers while providing Windows-compatible cursor files for desktop theming and user interface customization.
