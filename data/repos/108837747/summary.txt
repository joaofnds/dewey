`Bibata_Cursor` is a shell-script-based project providing open-source, material-designed cursor themes for Linux and Windows. It primarily functions as a customizable cursor set, enabling users to personalize their desktop cursor appearance with multiple color and size options. The project utilizes shell scripting for build automation, integrates with the `clickgen` and `cbmp` tools for generating cursor assets, and provides installation instructions for both Linux (using shell scripts and package managers) and Windows (via `.inf` files). This is a theme/resource project targeting end-users and developers who want to customize their desktop environments.
