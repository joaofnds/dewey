`xi-editor/xi-editor` is a discontinued, high-performance text editor core, written in Rust, designed for modern software engineering practices. The core's primary function is to handle editing operations efficiently, targeting a sub-16ms commit and paint time, with a focus on reliability and extensibility through a plugin system.  It utilizes a separation of front-end (UI) and back-end (core) modules with native UI integration, leveraging a persistent rope data structure for efficient file handling and asynchronous operations.  This standalone application provides a foundation for various frontends, aiming at developer friendliness and targeting those interested in text editor development and customization.
