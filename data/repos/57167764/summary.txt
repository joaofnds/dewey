Xi-editor is a discontinued high-performance text editor project featuring a Rust-based backend core with a modular frontend architecture. The system uses a persistent rope data structure for efficient text manipulation and implements asynchronous operations through JSON-RPC protocol communication between the core and various platform-specific frontends (Cocoa/macOS, GTK+, Electron, Qt). Targeting software developers and power users requiring sub-16ms editing performance, the editor addresses the need for reliable, Unicode-compliant text editing with native UI integration. The modular design separates expensive editing operations in the Rust backend from UI rendering in language-specific frontends, enabling cross-platform deployment while maintaining platform-native user experiences for code editing and general text manipulation workflows.
