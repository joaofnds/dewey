clojure-lsp is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for Clojure and ClojureScript that provides comprehensive IDE-like functionality across multiple editors. Built in Clojure with GraalVM native binary support, it performs static code analysis to deliver features including autocomplete, jump-to-definition, find references, refactoring, error detection, semantic highlighting, and code actions. The server targets software development tooling by bridging Clojure language support with LSP-compatible editors like VSCode, Emacs, and Vim, eliminating the need for editor-specific language plugins. It serves Clojure developers seeking modern IDE capabilities regardless of their editor choice, offering both interactive editing support and programmatic API access for automated code analysis and transformation workflows in Clojure ecosystem development.
