`clojure-lsp` is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for Clojure and ClojureScript, aiming to provide robust editing tools. It enables features such as autocompletion, jump-to-definition, find references, refactoring, code actions, error detection, and semantic highlighting. Built in Clojure, this project functions as a developer productivity tool, offering both CLI and API access for integration with various editors like Emacs, VSCode (Calva), and Vim, facilitating code navigation and enhancing the Clojure development workflow. The project also includes support for native binaries via GraalVM.
