Firezone is an enterprise zero-trust network access platform built as a modern alternative to legacy VPNs, targeting DevSecOps and network security domains. The system implements granular access control using WireGuard protocol for encrypted tunneling, with a multi-language architecture comprising an Elixir control plane (Phoenix/LiveView admin UI and API), Rust data plane components (gateway, relay servers, and cross-platform clients), and native mobile clients for iOS/Android. It addresses remote access management for organizations by providing policy-based network segmentation, peer-to-peer connectivity with NAT traversal, and integration with identity providers like OIDC, Google Workspace, and Okta. The platform targets system administrators, DevSecOps engineers, and IT security teams requiring scalable, self-hosted network access solutions with automated user/group synchronization and load-balanced gateway deployments.
