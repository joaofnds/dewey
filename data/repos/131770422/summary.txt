`coc.nvim` is a TypeScript-based Neovim/Vim plugin acting as a Node.js extension host, enabling smart code editing features similar to VS Code. It facilitates autocompletion, language server protocol (LSP) support, and integration with VS Code-compatible extensions, enhancing the capabilities of Vim and Neovim.  The plugin leverages a separate Node.js process to avoid impacting Vim's performance and supports features like diagnostics, code navigation, and refactoring, offering a customizable and feature-rich development environment. This project is a plugin designed to extend and improve the development experience within the Vim and Neovim text editors.
