Earthly is a container-based build automation framework written in Go that provides reproducible CI/CD pipelines for DevOps and software development teams. It uses a hybrid syntax combining Dockerfile and Makefile patterns in "Earthfiles" to define build targets that execute inside isolated Docker containers. The framework addresses build reproducibility issues across different environments by containerizing the entire build process, enabling consistent execution on local machines, CI systems, and production environments. It supports polyglot development workflows, integrating with existing build tools like npm, Maven, Cargo, and Go modules rather than replacing them. Earthly targets DevOps engineers and developers working with monorepos or polyrepos who need reliable, cacheable, and parallelizable build processes that work consistently across heterogeneous development and deployment environments.
