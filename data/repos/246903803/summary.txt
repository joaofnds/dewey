Earthly is a build automation framework written in Go, designed to simplify and accelerate the creation of repeatable and reproducible builds, particularly for containerized applications and CI/CD pipelines. Its core functionality centers around providing a declarative build specification (Earthfile) that leverages Dockerfile-like syntax alongside Makefile-inspired features, allowing developers to define build processes for any language or framework that runs on Linux. Key features include parallel execution, intelligent caching, multi-platform support, and an advanced import system facilitating modular builds across multiple repositories. This framework acts as a wrapper around existing build tools, making it ideal for developer productivity, targeting software engineers and DevOps professionals building containerized applications or managing complex build workflows.
