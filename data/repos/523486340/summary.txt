**hereby** is a simple Node.js task runner implemented in TypeScript, providing an efficient solution for managing dependencies and executing tasks within JavaScript projects. It allows users to define tasks in ES modules (ESM) or TypeScript files, with support for parallel execution of multiple tasks. The core feature is the ability to create a dependency graph of tasks, enabling users to run tasks based on their dependencies, similar to tools like `make`. This library is particularly useful for automating build processes, testing, and other repetitive tasks in JavaScript projects. It supports popular Node.js runtime environments and can be integrated with various task-specific libraries or scripts. The project's focus is on providing a flexible and extensible task runner for JavaScript developers.
