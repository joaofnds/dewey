`hereby` is a lightweight Node.js task runner built in TypeScript targeting web development and JavaScript build automation workflows. It provides a declarative approach to defining build tasks through ES module-based configuration files (`Herebyfile.mjs`), supporting task dependencies and parallel execution for operations like TypeScript compilation, testing, linting, and bundling. The tool addresses the need for simple dependency graph management in JavaScript projects without the complexity of larger build systems, offering CLI execution with TypeScript support via `.mts` files and runtime loaders. Designed for frontend/backend JavaScript developers who need straightforward task orchestration with explicit dependency resolution, it emphasizes simplicity over feature completeness by intentionally avoiding serial task execution and ensuring single-run task semantics within each invocation.
