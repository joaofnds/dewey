Boot is a Clojure-based build framework and script evaluator designed for building Clojure applications and projects. It targets Clojure developers working on web applications, microservices, and complex software projects requiring sophisticated build processes. Boot leverages a functional programming approach where build tasks are composable functions that form pipelines, running within a managed JVM runtime environment with fine-grained classloader isolation. The framework provides dynamic dependency resolution from Maven repositories, immutable filesystem trees, and scriptable build processes written in Clojure itself rather than static configuration files. It addresses the limitations of traditional build tools by offering Turing-complete build specifications, enabling developers to handle complex integrations like asset pipelines, multi-environment deployments, and artifact compilation without the rigidity of declarative build configurations.
