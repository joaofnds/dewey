Boot is a Clojure-based build tool and script evaluator designed for building Clojure projects. It provides a runtime environment for executing build scripts written in Clojure, enabling flexible and Turing-complete build specifications. Key features include dependency management via Maven repositories, a managed filesystem tree, classloader isolation, and the composition of tasks into build pipelines. This standalone command-line tool, also installable via package managers like Homebrew and Chocolatey, is a framework for Clojure developers looking to automate build processes, manage dependencies, and create custom build workflows.
