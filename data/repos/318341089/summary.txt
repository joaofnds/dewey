Lexical is a JavaScript text editor framework developed by Facebook for web development, built with TypeScript and designed for creating customizable rich text editing experiences in web applications. It provides a dependency-free core engine with React bindings (@lexical/react) that enables developers to build extensible text editors through a plugin-based architecture. The framework addresses the complexity of implementing reliable, accessible, and performant text editing functionality by offering a composable system of React components and plugins for features like history management, content editing, and custom editor behaviors. Targeted at frontend developers and web application teams, Lexical serves as an alternative to traditional WYSIWYG editors, providing fine-grained control over editor state management and rendering while maintaining cross-browser compatibility and accessibility standards.
