MonitorControl is a macOS system utility application built in Swift that enables direct control of external monitor parameters including brightness, contrast, and volume through a native menubar interface and keyboard shortcuts. The application targets desktop users and system administrators managing multi-monitor setups by leveraging DDC (Display Data Channel) protocol communication to bypass native macOS limitations for external display control. The codebase utilizes Swift with Xcode toolchain, integrates MediaKeyTap for keyboard input handling, MASPreferences for settings management, DDC.swift for hardware communication, and AMCoreAudio for audio control. It addresses the common macOS pain point where built-in display controls don't extend to external monitors, providing a native macOS experience with system-level OSD integration for users requiring granular external display management without vendor-specific software.
