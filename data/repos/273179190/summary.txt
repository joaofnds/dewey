pdfshot is a web service that generates PDF screenshots of web pages, built using Clojure/ClojureScript and leveraging Puppeteer for browser automation. The application targets web developers and DevOps engineers who need programmatic webpage-to-PDF conversion capabilities, commonly required for report generation, documentation automation, or web scraping workflows. It exposes a REST API that accepts target URLs and optional CSS selectors for element-specific waiting, then returns PDF files of rendered web pages. The service is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and includes SYS_ADMIN capabilities to run headless Chrome/Chromium instances. Built with Leiningen as the Clojure build tool, it addresses the need for reliable, server-side webpage rendering and PDF generation without requiring GUI environments or complex browser installations.
