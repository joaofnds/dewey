This repository provides a custom Homebrew formula for installing GNU Emacs on macOS systems, targeting software developers and system administrators who need flexible Emacs installations. Built using Ruby for Homebrew package management, it supports multiple Emacs versions (26.3 through 31.0.50) with extensive compilation options including native compilation, JSON support, XML processing, image libraries, and macOS-specific Cocoa integration. The formula addresses limitations of the standard Homebrew Emacs package by offering advanced features like tree-sitter parsing, mailutils integration, and development-oriented debugging capabilities. It includes comprehensive CI/CD testing across all supported Emacs versions and serves developers who require customized Emacs builds with specific feature sets for text editing, programming, and system administration tasks on macOS environments.
