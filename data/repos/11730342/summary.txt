Vue 2 is an end-of-life, inactive, frontend JavaScript framework designed for building user interfaces. It facilitates the creation of interactive web applications by providing a progressive architecture that's incrementally adoptable. This framework focuses on the view layer, supporting features like component-based development and offering integration with libraries for routing (vue-router), state management (vuex), and server-side rendering. Built with TypeScript, Vue 2 targets ES5-compliant browsers and serves frontend developers building web applications.
