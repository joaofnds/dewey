Vue.js 2 is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces in web development, designed for frontend developers creating interactive web applications and single-page applications (SPAs). Built with TypeScript and JavaScript, it provides a reactive, component-based architecture that focuses on the view layer while offering incremental adoption capabilities. The framework addresses the complexity of modern web UI development through declarative rendering, component composition, and state management, supporting ES5-compliant browsers. Its ecosystem includes vue-router for client-side routing, Vuex for state management, vue-loader for webpack integration, and vue-server-renderer for SSR. Vue 2 reached end-of-life in December 2023, with active development moved to Vue 3, making this repository a legacy codebase for existing Vue 2 applications requiring maintenance or migration planning.
