The h4cc/awesome-elixir repository is a curated directory of Elixir and Erlang libraries, tools, and resources organized into 70+ categories spanning web development, distributed systems, data processing, and infrastructure domains. It serves as a comprehensive reference for Elixir developers seeking libraries for specific use cases including web frameworks (Phoenix), ORM/database mapping (Ecto), authentication, API development, real-time communication, machine learning, embedded systems (Nerves), and DevOps tooling. The repository covers the entire Elixir ecosystem from low-level OTP (Open Telecom Platform) components to high-level application frameworks, targeting backend developers, system architects, and engineers building fault-tolerant, concurrent applications on the BEAM virtual machine. It functions as a community-maintained knowledge base for navigating Elixir's ecosystem across domains like fintech, IoT, web services, and distributed computing platforms.
