The icalendar gem is a Ruby library for programmatically creating, parsing, and manipulating iCalendar files according to RFC-5545 specifications. Targeting web developers and Ruby application builders who need to integrate calendar functionality, it provides a comprehensive API for generating calendar events, todos, journals, and alarms with support for complex properties like recurrence rules, timezones, and property parameters. The library handles iCalendar format serialization/deserialization, enabling developers to build calendar applications, scheduling systems, or integrate with existing calendar services like Google Calendar and Outlook. It solves the problem of manual iCalendar format handling by providing Ruby objects that abstract the underlying RFC-5545 complexity while maintaining full compliance with the standard for enterprise calendar integration workflows.
