`pot` is a Go-based command-line application designed to render media, specifically images and videos, within a terminal environment using pixels. It features a modular architecture with pluggable loaders (currently with an FFmpeg-based loader supporting formats compatible with FFmpeg) and render engines built upon Go's `image.Image` interface. Key functionalities include loading media and displaying it directly in the terminal, providing a basic media viewing experience. The project's architecture leverages the standard Go library, with a runtime dependency on FFmpeg.
