Pot (Pixel On Terminal) is a terminal-based media viewer written in Go that renders images, videos, and live camera feeds as ASCII/Unicode art in command-line interfaces. The application uses a modular architecture with pluggable loaders (currently FFmpeg-based for broad codec support) and render engines that convert standard Go `image.Image` objects into terminal-displayable characters through various sampling techniques like 4x8 pixel sampling. Targeting developers, system administrators, and terminal enthusiasts in the CLI tools domain, Pot solves the problem of viewing multimedia content in headless environments or purely terminal-based workflows where traditional GUI media viewers are unavailable. The project leverages Go's standard library for core functionality while depending on FFmpeg at runtime for media decoding, enabling support for all FFmpeg-compatible formats and codecs.
