This Ruby-based project provides a system font replacement for macOS 10.10 Yosemite, substituting the default Helvetica Neue font with Apple's San Francisco font, mirroring the Apple Watch's UI. Functionality is achieved through a shell script-driven installation process that copies specially-crafted San Francisco font files to `/Library/Fonts`, effectively overriding the system defaults. The project employs Ruby scripting for the installation and includes manual installation instructions. It is targeted at users who want to customize their system font for aesthetic and potentially developer-related reasons.
