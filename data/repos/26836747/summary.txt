This repository provides a system font replacement tool for macOS Yosemite that substitutes the default Helvetica Neue system font with Apple's San Francisco typeface (originally designed for Apple Watch). Built with Ruby, it includes installation scripts and specially-crafted font files with modified name tables that take precedence over system fonts via the `/Library/Fonts` directory hierarchy. The tool targets macOS system administrators, UI/UX designers, and Apple developers who want to preview San Francisco typography across their desktop environment. It leverages macOS font loading mechanisms without modifying core system files, using font precedence rules and system utilities like `atsutil` for font cache management. The solution addresses the need for early adoption of Apple's San Francisco typeface before its official system-wide implementation in later macOS versions.
