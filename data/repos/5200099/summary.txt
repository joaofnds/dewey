The thoughtbot/guides repository is a comprehensive style guide and best practices documentation for software development teams, primarily targeting web development workflows. It provides standardized coding conventions, collaboration protocols, and technical guidelines across multiple programming languages (Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Elixir, Swift) and frameworks (Rails, React, React Native, Ember, Android/iOS). The repository covers full-stack development concerns including frontend technologies (CSS, HTML, Sass), backend databases (Postgres), development tools (Git, GraphQL), testing frameworks (RSpec, Jest), and cross-cutting concerns like accessibility, security, and web performance. Designed for professional development teams and individual developers seeking consistent coding standards, it addresses the common problem of maintaining code quality and team coordination across diverse technology stacks in modern web application development.
