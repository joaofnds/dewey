Gerbil Scheme is a systems programming dialect of Scheme built on top of the Gambit runtime and compiler, designed for high-performance ahead-of-time compilation. It provides an advanced macro system based on quote-syntax with native syntax-case implementation and a full module system similar to Racket's but with single instantiation semantics. The language targets systems programmers and Scheme developers who need compiled performance with sophisticated metaprogramming capabilities, offering extensive standard libraries for cryptography, databases (SQLite), and system-level operations. Gerbil serves as a more feature-rich alternative to traditional Scheme implementations, positioning itself as "C++ to Gambit's C" for developers building performance-critical applications requiring Lisp's expressiveness and macro capabilities.
