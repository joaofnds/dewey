`flx` is an Emacs Lisp library providing fuzzy matching functionality, specifically designed as a developer productivity tool to enhance file and buffer name completion, akin to Sublime Text's matching capabilities. It offers a matching engine, `flx`, and an `ido` interface, `flx-ido`, for integration with Emacs' ido completion system. This plugin prioritizes matching based on a balance between word beginnings and contiguous substrings, with the option for uppercase-aware matching. The project is a package/plugin for Emacs, utilizing Emacs Lisp and is targeted at Emacs users seeking enhanced file navigation and selection within their editor.
