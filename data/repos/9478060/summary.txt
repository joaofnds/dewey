The flx repository implements a fuzzy string matching algorithm for Emacs, designed to replicate Sublime Text's intelligent file/buffer completion behavior. Built in Emacs Lisp, it provides a scoring system that balances word beginnings (abbreviation matching) and contiguous substring matches, with optimizations for filename completion by scoring basepath matches higher. The library includes ido integration through flx-ido mode and features case-folding with selective uppercase matching. It targets Emacs power users and developers who want enhanced completion workflows, trading memory usage (approximately 10MB for 10k filenames) for speed through aggressive caching. The algorithm addresses the limitations of basic flex matching by providing contextually-aware scoring that better matches human intuition for file and buffer selection in development environments.
