BinF is a cross-platform Clojure/ClojureScript library for binary data manipulation and protocol handling across JVM, browser, Node.js, and Babashka environments. It provides a unified API for reading, writing, and copying binary data through protocol extensions to native host classes (ByteBuffer on JVM, DataView in JavaScript), enabling seamless binary format processing for systems programming, native library interop, and WebAssembly integration. The library offers primitive type coercions, 64-bit integer handling, memory-mapped file support, C-like struct/union definitions in EDN, and utilities for Base64 encoding and LEB128. Targeted at systems developers and low-level programming applications requiring cross-platform binary data processing, it addresses the fragmented landscape of binary handling libraries in the Clojure ecosystem with performance-focused, production-ready tooling.
