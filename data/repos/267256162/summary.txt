`helins/binf.cljc` is a Clojure/ClojureScript library designed for handling binary data formats and facilitating interaction with native libraries and WebAssembly modules. It provides cross-platform functionality for reading, writing, and manipulating binary data through protocols that enhance host classes like `ByteBuffer` and `DataView`, supporting various primitive types, including 64-bit integers. Key features include IO operations, memory-mapped file support on the JVM, and utilities such as Base64 encoding/decoding. The library is primarily a Clojure library, built to handle binary format data for various use-cases on different platforms, and is intended for developers working with Clojure and ClojureScript who require low-level binary data manipulation capabilities.
