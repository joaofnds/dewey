govim is a Go development plugin for Vim8 that serves as an IDE-like enhancement for Go programming within the Vim text editor ecosystem. Built entirely in Go rather than VimScript, it integrates with gopls (Go Language Server Protocol implementation) to provide essential development features including code completion, format-on-save, hover documentation, and go-to-definition functionality. The plugin targets Go developers who prefer Vim8/gvim as their primary editor, offering a modern alternative to vim-go with LSP-driven intelligence. It requires Go 1.12+ and Vim 8.1.1711+, and provides both a command-line tool and an API for plugin developers to interface with Vim8 using Go. The project addresses the need for robust Go language support in Vim while leveraging Go's own toolchain and language server capabilities for enhanced development workflows.
