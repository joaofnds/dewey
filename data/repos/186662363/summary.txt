NodeGui is a cross-platform desktop application framework that enables Node.js developers to build native GUI applications using JavaScript/TypeScript and CSS styling. Built on Qt6 with C++ bindings, it provides a lightweight alternative to Electron for desktop development, offering lower CPU and memory consumption while maintaining full Node.js API compatibility. The framework supports CSS-based styling with Flexbox layout, native widget event handling, and integrates with popular frontend frameworks through React NodeGui, Vue NodeGui, and Svelte NodeGui variants. Targeting web developers transitioning to desktop application development, NodeGui addresses the performance limitations of Chromium-based solutions by leveraging Qt's native rendering engine while preserving the familiar JavaScript development experience and NPM ecosystem access.
