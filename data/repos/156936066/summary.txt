This Jupyter Notebook repository provides an introduction to face detection using Python and the OpenCV library. It demonstrates image processing techniques, including image loading, basic operations, and shape drawing, culminating in the implementation of face detection using pre-trained Haar and LBP classifiers. The project focuses on object detection within the computer vision domain, offering practical examples and explanations for detecting human faces within digital images. It serves as an example/tutorial project for developers and individuals interested in learning about computer vision and OpenCV's capabilities for image analysis.
