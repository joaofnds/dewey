This repository provides a comprehensive educational implementation of face detection using OpenCV and Python, targeting computer vision and machine learning practitioners. Built as Jupyter notebooks, it demonstrates how to leverage OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascade and LBP classifiers to detect human faces in digital images without requiring custom model training. The project covers fundamental computer vision concepts including image processing as NumPy arrays, basic OpenCV operations, and object detection techniques. Designed for developers and data scientists learning computer vision, it serves as a practical tutorial for implementing face detection systems in applications spanning photography, security, and marketing domains. The repository emphasizes hands-on learning through executable code examples and detailed explanations of underlying computer vision principles.
