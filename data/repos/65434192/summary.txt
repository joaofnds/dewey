GJSON is a high-performance JSON parsing library for Go that provides fast, read-only access to JSON document values without full deserialization. It implements a dot-notation path syntax for querying nested JSON structures, supporting wildcards, array indexing, conditional queries, and pattern matching operations. The library targets backend Go developers working with REST APIs, configuration files, log processing, and data transformation pipelines where efficient JSON value extraction is critical. Key features include single-line value retrieval, JSONLines support, array iteration, and query operators for filtering. GJSON solves the performance bottleneck of traditional JSON unmarshaling when only specific values are needed from large JSON documents, making it particularly valuable for microservices, API gateways, and data processing applications that handle high-volume JSON traffic.
