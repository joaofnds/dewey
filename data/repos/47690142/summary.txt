Sourcetrail is a free, open-source, cross-platform interactive source code explorer designed to enhance developer productivity when navigating unfamiliar codebases. Built with C++ and supporting C, C++, Java, and Python, it provides a graphical user interface for visualizing code structure, supporting offline operation, and offering an SDK (SourcetrailDB) for custom language extension development. It is a standalone application that analyzes source code to provide interactive exploration features. Dependencies include CMake, Git, Boost, and Qt, with language-specific dependencies like LLVM/Clang and JDK also present depending on which languages the user wishes to include.
