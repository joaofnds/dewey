Sourcetrail is a cross-platform source code exploration and visualization tool built in C++ with Qt 5.12.3 for GUI rendering, designed to help software developers navigate and understand unfamiliar codebases. The application targets the software development domain by providing interactive code analysis and visualization capabilities for C, C++, Java, and Python projects. It operates as a standalone desktop application using Boost libraries for filesystem operations and interprocess communication, generating indexed representations of source code to enable rapid code comprehension through visual exploration. The tool addresses the common developer challenge of onboarding to large or complex codebases by offering offline code browsing, dependency visualization, and call graph analysis. Sourcetrail includes an SDK (SourcetrailDB) for extending language support and uses CMake for cross-platform builds on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it particularly valuable for software engineers, code reviewers, and development teams working with multi-language projects.
