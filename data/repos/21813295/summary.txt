re-com is a ClojureScript UI component library built on top of Reagent (React wrapper) that provides desktop-focused web application components for functional reactive programming. It targets web developers building single-page applications (SPAs) in the ClojureScript/re-frame ecosystem, offering reusable widgets like dropdowns, date pickers, popovers, and tabs, alongside sophisticated layout components for arranging UI elements hierarchically. The library emphasizes desktop-class application development over mobile responsiveness, featuring Bootstrap styling with Material Design icons. It solves the component reusability problem in ClojureScript web development by providing a comprehensive widget toolkit that integrates seamlessly with Reagent's reactive paradigm, enabling developers to rapidly construct complex user interfaces without building components from scratch.
