`re-com` is a ClojureScript library providing reusable UI components for building single-page applications (SPAs) with Reagent and leveraging the React library. It offers a collection of UI widgets, layout components, and a mostly Bootstrap-inspired styling, aiming to streamline the development of desktop-class web applications. Key features include components like dropdowns, date pickers, and tabs, along with layout components for flexible arrangement. This library targets frontend developers building ClojureScript-based web applications, with a focus on desktop-like UI experiences and is designed for use with re-frame, an MVC-ish framework.
