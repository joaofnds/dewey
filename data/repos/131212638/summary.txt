gVisor is an application kernel written in Go that provides strong isolation for containerized applications by implementing a Linux-compatible interface in userspace. It serves the DevOps and container orchestration domain, integrating with Docker, Kubernetes, and OCI-compliant runtimes through its `runsc` runtime component. Unlike traditional container security approaches using syscall filters or Linux namespaces, gVisor intercepts system calls and handles them in a memory-safe userspace kernel, reducing the attack surface of the host kernel. The project targets system administrators, platform engineers, and security-focused DevOps teams who need to run untrusted or multi-tenant workloads with VM-level security guarantees while maintaining container-like performance and resource efficiency in production environments.
