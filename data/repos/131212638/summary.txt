gVisor is an application kernel designed to provide a secure sandboxing environment for containers, enhancing isolation between applications and the host operating system. Written in Go and running in userspace, it implements a Linux-like interface, improving container security by reducing the host kernel's attack surface. The project includes an OCI runtime, `runsc`, that integrates with Docker and Kubernetes to facilitate sandboxed container execution, offering a distinct alternative to traditional syscall filtering and virtual machines. It is a standalone application with CLI tools, aimed at system administrators and developers managing containerized applications, providing enhanced security and flexibility for container deployments.
