tRPC is a TypeScript-first framework for building end-to-end typesafe APIs in web development, eliminating the need for code generation or schema definitions. It leverages TypeScript's type system to provide full static type safety between client and server, with automatic type inference and autocompletion across the entire API surface. The framework integrates seamlessly with modern web technologies including React, Next.js, Express, Fastify, and Prisma, targeting full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript developers building web applications. tRPC solves the type safety gap in traditional REST or GraphQL APIs by enabling direct function calls with compile-time type checking, request batching, and real-time subscriptions while maintaining a lightweight runtime footprint and supporting incremental adoption in existing projects.
