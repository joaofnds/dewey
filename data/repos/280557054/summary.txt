tRPC is a TypeScript-based library for building type-safe APIs, primarily targeting web application backends, with a focus on developer productivity and end-to-end type safety. It enables the creation of APIs without requiring schemas or code generation, providing features such as full static type safety and autocompletion on the client, request batching, and subscriptions support. Leveraging React, Next.js, and Prisma, among others, the project offers adapters for various frameworks and is designed for ease of integration into existing projects, making it a valuable developer tool for modern web application development.
