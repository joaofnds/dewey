VimR is a native macOS GUI client for Neovim built in Swift using Cocoa frameworks, targeting software developers and text editor power users who prefer Vim-style editing with modern IDE conveniences. The application wraps Neovim's engine with macOS-specific UI components, implementing MessagePack RPC communication through RxSwift for reactive programming patterns and Redux architecture for state management. It addresses the need for a native macOS Neovim experience by providing features like markdown preview, fuzzy file finding, trackpad gestures, ligature support, and workspace management while maintaining Neovim's modal editing paradigm. The codebase includes reusable Swift Package Manager modules for embedding Neovim in Cocoa applications, making it valuable for developers building similar editor integrations in the macOS ecosystem.
