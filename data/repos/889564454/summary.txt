ADL is a command-line tool written in Zig for managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in software development projects. It targets software architects, engineering teams, and project maintainers who need to document and track architectural decisions within their codebases. The tool automates the creation of structured markdown files for ADRs with zero-padded numbering, generates and maintains a centralized README catalog in the project's `adr` directory, and provides commands for creating new records (`adl create`) and regenerating documentation (`adl regen`). ADL addresses the common problem of inconsistent or missing architectural documentation by providing a standardized workflow for capturing design decisions, making it particularly valuable for DevOps teams, software architects, and development teams practicing documentation-driven architecture in version-controlled repositories.
