`helm-swoop` is an Emacs Lisp plugin designed to enhance developer productivity by integrating with the Helm interface for efficient text manipulation within Emacs buffers. It allows users to quickly "swoop" through lines matching a given input, highlighting multiple matched patterns, and offers features for multi-buffer operations, editing matched lines, and integrating with isearch and evil-search modes. The plugin's functionality centers around the Helm framework and leverages Emacs Lisp for its core logic, providing capabilities like caching and configurable keybindings for streamlined text search and modification. This is a plugin intended for Emacs users focused on text-based development.
