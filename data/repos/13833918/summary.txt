helm-swoop is an Emacs Lisp package that provides an interactive line-based search and navigation interface for text editors within the Emacs ecosystem. Built on top of the Helm completion framework, it enables developers and text editor users to efficiently search, filter, and jump between matching lines across single or multiple buffers simultaneously. The tool offers real-time line culling with pattern highlighting, live cursor synchronization between search results and source buffers, and in-place editing capabilities for matched lines. It integrates with various Emacs modes including org-mode, isearch, and projectile, supporting multi-buffer operations and context-aware searches. The package targets Emacs power users, developers, and writers who need rapid code navigation, text manipulation, and cross-file searching capabilities within their Emacs-based development environment, solving the problem of efficiently locating and editing specific content across large codebases or document collections.
