Nx is a TypeScript-based build system and development toolkit specifically designed for monorepo management in JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems. It targets web developers working with large-scale applications built using Angular, React, Next.js, Node.js, and related frameworks. The system provides intelligent build orchestration through dependency graph analysis, computational caching, and parallel task execution to optimize build performance. Nx includes code generation capabilities, workspace organization tools, and integrates with popular development tools like Cypress, Storybook, and various CI/CD platforms. It addresses the complexity of managing multiple interconnected applications and libraries within a single repository by providing automated dependency tracking, selective rebuilds, and distributed task execution across development teams working on enterprise-scale web applications.
