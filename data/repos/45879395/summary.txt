This repository contains the SERIES package for Common Lisp, originally developed by Richard C. Waters, which provides a functional programming abstraction for processing sequences and collections. The package implements a domain-specific language for expressing computations over series (lazy sequences) using declarative operations like mapping, filtering, and reduction, similar to stream processing paradigms. It serves the functional programming and symbolic computation domain, targeting Common Lisp developers who need efficient sequence processing without explicit loop constructs. The SERIES package addresses performance concerns in functional sequence operations by providing compile-time optimizations that transform high-level series expressions into efficient iterative code, eliminating intermediate data structures and function call overhead typical in naive functional implementations.
