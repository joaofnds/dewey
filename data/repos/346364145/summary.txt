`Based Cooking Website` is a static website project for sharing culinary recipes. The website is built using Hugo, a static site generator, and the content is organized in Markdown files. Functionality includes recipe submission by users, with specific guidelines on formatting, image quality (requiring `.webp` format and small file sizes), and content adherence to "traditional" cuisine. Contributors can add recipes, improve existing recipes, and include personal links/donation addresses in JSON format. The project is a standalone web application, primarily utilizing CSS for styling, aimed at individuals interested in sharing or discovering recipes adhering to specific culinary preferences.
