DALL·E mini is a Python-based, open-source project designed to generate images from textual prompts, offering a simplified implementation of the DALL·E model. It leverages a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture and includes integrations with Hugging Face's model hub for pre-trained models, specifically VQGAN for encoding/decoding and DALL·E mini/mega for image generation. The project includes tools for model training and inference via a Colab notebook and also provides a web interface accessible through Craiyon, serving as a standalone application for text-to-image generation. The project is a research artifact and a demonstrator of text-to-image capabilities, targeting researchers and users interested in exploring and experimenting with generative AI.
