Falcon is a high-performance HTTP server for Ruby web applications, built on asynchronous programming primitives including async, async-container, and async-http libraries. It implements a multi-process, multi-fiber architecture that handles HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 protocols with TLS support, designed as a Rack-compatible alternative to traditional Ruby servers like Puma and Passenger. The server uses lightweight fibers for concurrent request processing, allowing upstream blocking operations without stalling the entire process. Targeted at Ruby web developers and DevOps engineers, Falcon addresses performance bottlenecks in Ruby web application deployment by providing unified development and production environments, eliminating the need for separate server configurations like Nginx+Passenger combinations while maintaining compatibility with existing Rack-based applications including Rails.
