`bubbles` is a Go library providing reusable TUI (Text User Interface) components for building terminal-based applications, specifically for the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework. It offers a collection of pre-built UI elements including spinners, text input fields, text areas, tables, progress bars, paginators, viewports, lists, file pickers, timers, stopwatches, help views, and keybinding management. This library aims to simplify TUI development by providing ready-to-use components and is primarily intended for Go developers seeking to create interactive command-line interfaces or terminal-based applications with a consistent look and feel.
