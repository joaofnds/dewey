Bubbles is a Go library providing pre-built TUI (Terminal User Interface) components for the Bubble Tea framework, which implements the Elm architecture pattern for terminal applications. It offers production-ready UI components including text inputs, tables, progress bars, spinners, lists, file pickers, viewports, and navigation helpers specifically designed for CLI application development. The library targets Go developers building interactive command-line tools and terminal-based applications who need standardized, customizable interface elements with built-in keyboard navigation, mouse support, and accessibility features. Bubbles solves the problem of repeatedly implementing common UI patterns in terminal applications by providing a comprehensive component library that handles complex interactions like text editing, scrolling, pagination, and data visualization within the constraints of text-based interfaces.
