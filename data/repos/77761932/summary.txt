el-patch is an Emacs Lisp library designed for system administrators and Emacs power users who need to modify existing Elisp functions in a maintainable way. It addresses the problem of overriding third-party package functions where standard customization hooks are insufficient, providing a future-proof alternative to Emacs' advice system. The library uses patch directives (add, remove, swap, wrap) to simultaneously define both original and modified function definitions, enabling validation against upstream changes through Ediff integration. Key features include lazy-loading support, use-package integration, and automated patch validation to detect when original functions change during package updates, preventing silent breakage in Emacs configurations.
