`el-patch` is an Emacs Lisp library designed to future-proof Emacs Lisp customizations. It provides a system for defining and validating patches that modify Emacs Lisp functions, macros, and variables, mitigating issues arising from updates to Emacs or its packages. Key functionalities include patch directives for adding, removing, swapping, and wrapping code segments, as well as support for defining patch variants, templates, and integration with `use-package`. This library aims to enhance developer productivity by enabling robust and maintainable Emacs Lisp configurations through a mechanism analogous to patching systems.
