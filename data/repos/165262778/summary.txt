Zeitwerk is a Ruby code loader that provides efficient, thread-safe autoloading and eager loading capabilities for Ruby applications and gems. It eliminates the need for manual `require` statements by automatically loading classes and modules based on conventional file structure and naming patterns, where file paths correspond to constant paths. The library supports multiple independent loaders, custom inflection rules, code reloading for development environments, and comprehensive introspection APIs. Primarily targeting Ruby web developers and gem authors, Zeitwerk solves the brittleness of traditional Ruby autoloading mechanisms by using absolute file paths and single project tree scans, making it particularly valuable for Rails applications and Ruby gems requiring reliable dependency management without manual file loading coordination.
