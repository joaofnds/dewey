Zeitwerk is a Ruby library designed for efficient and thread-safe code loading, primarily for use in Ruby gems and applications. It addresses the brittleness of `require` by automatically loading classes and modules based on a conventional file structure where file paths directly correspond to constant paths. Key functionalities include autoloading, eager loading, code reloading, and inflection customization, providing features for managing dependencies, facilitating development workflows, and ensuring consistent code availability. The library is implemented in Ruby and provides specific interfaces for gems and gem extensions.
