Capistrano is a Ruby-based deployment automation framework that orchestrates application deployments across remote servers using SSH connections and Rake task execution. Built for the DevOps and web development domains, it provides standardized deployment workflows with support for multiple environments (staging, production), parallel execution across server fleets, and role-based server management. The tool abstracts complex deployment scripts into reusable tasks while maintaining SSH-level control, enabling system administrators and developers to automate code deployments for applications built in any language or framework (Rails, PHP, Java). Capistrano solves the problem of manual, error-prone deployments by providing consistent, repeatable deployment processes with extensibility through Ruby gems and community-contributed task libraries.
