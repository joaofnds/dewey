aws-api is a data-driven Clojure library that provides programmatic access to AWS services through an idiomatic functional interface. Built for cloud infrastructure and DevOps automation, it wraps AWS SDK functionality using Clojure's data-oriented paradigm, eliminating the need for Java interop and object-oriented AWS SDK patterns. The library generates service clients and operations from AWS service descriptions, exposing all AWS APIs through two core functions: `client` for service instantiation and `invoke` for operation execution. Targeting Clojure developers building cloud-native applications, it handles request/response transformations, authentication, and error handling while maintaining consistency across all AWS services. The library addresses the complexity of integrating AWS services into functional Clojure codebases by providing a uniform map-in/map-out interface for all cloud operations.
