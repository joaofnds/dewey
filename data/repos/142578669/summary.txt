`aws-api` is a Clojure library providing data-driven, idiomatic access to AWS services. It facilitates invoking AWS APIs through a data-oriented interface, leveraging data descriptions from `aws-sdk-java-2` to generate clients and operations.  Key functionalities include client creation, operation invocation (`invoke` function), and handling of AWS responses, including error mapping. This library is designed for Clojure developers building applications that interact with AWS, acting as an SDK and providing features for explicit credential management and region configuration, enhancing data-driven interaction with various AWS services.
