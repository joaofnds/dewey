`postgresml/postgresml` is a Rust-based PostgreSQL extension that integrates machine learning and AI functionalities directly within the database, enabling in-database ML/AI operations. This project provides GPU acceleration for faster computations and model inference, supports Large Language Models from Hugging Face, and offers a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with built-in functions for chunking, embedding, ranking, and transforming text. Key features include vector search via pgvector, various ML algorithms, high performance, and scalability, with a focus on NLP tasks. It is a PostgreSQL extension, and targets data scientists and database engineers seeking to run ML/AI applications.
