PostgresML is a Rust-based PostgreSQL extension that integrates machine learning and AI capabilities directly within the database, targeting data scientists and ML engineers working on AI applications. It provides GPU-accelerated inference for large language models from Hugging Face, implements complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines with vector embeddings via pgvector integration, and offers 47+ classification/regression algorithms for traditional ML tasks. The system eliminates data movement overhead by executing ML operations in-database, supporting NLP tasks like text classification, summarization, and question answering through SQL functions. Key components include pgml.embed for generating embeddings, pgml.chunk for text splitting, pgml.rank for similarity search, and pgml.transform for LLM inference, making it suitable for building AI-powered applications that require high-performance vector search and ML model serving within PostgreSQL infrastructure.
