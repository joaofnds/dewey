The Marvellous Suspender is a privacy-focused Chrome browser extension built in JavaScript that automatically suspends inactive tabs to reduce memory consumption and prevent browser crashes. Forked from The Great Suspender 7.1.6, it removes tracking components while maintaining core functionality for resource management. The extension uses Chrome's extension APIs, html2canvas for tab previews, and IndexedDB (via db.js wrapper) for data persistence. It targets web developers, power users, and system administrators who manage multiple browser tabs and need to optimize system resources. The extension implements configurable suspension timers, tab restoration capabilities, and supports localization through Crowdin. Built with standard web technologies and Chrome Extension Manifest, it addresses memory optimization in web browsing environments where resource constraints are critical.
