CUE is a configuration and data validation language, implemented in Go, designed to define and validate text-based and dynamic configurations. It enables users to write schemas, validate data against those schemas, and ensure configurations adhere to defined policies. The project provides a command-line interface (`cue`) and a Go API for interacting with CUE programs, facilitating integration with formats like JSON, YAML, and OpenAPI, targeting developers and system administrators involved in configuration management, data validation, and Kubernetes deployments, as suggested by its associated topics. CUE is a standalone application and a language with its own compiler.
