CUE is a configuration management and data validation language implemented in Go that enables developers and DevOps engineers to define, validate, and unify configuration data across multiple formats including JSON, YAML, OpenAPI, and JSON Schema. The language focuses on policy enforcement and schema validation for infrastructure configuration, particularly targeting Kubernetes deployments and cloud-native environments. CUE provides a command-line interface and Go API for programmatic integration, allowing system administrators and platform engineers to establish constraints and validation rules for configuration files while maintaining compatibility with existing toolchains. The project addresses configuration drift, validation inconsistencies, and policy compliance in modern infrastructure-as-code workflows through its type system and constraint-based validation approach.
