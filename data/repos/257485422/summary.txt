Vite is a next-generation frontend build tool and development server designed for modern web development workflows. Built with TypeScript and leveraging native ES modules, it provides instant server startup and lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development, while using Rollup for optimized production builds. The tool targets frontend developers working with JavaScript frameworks and modern web applications, offering a dual-mode architecture that serves source files directly via ES modules in development and bundles code for production deployment. Vite features an extensible plugin system with full TypeScript support, comprehensive JavaScript APIs, and addresses the performance bottlenecks of traditional bundler-based development servers by eliminating the need to bundle code during development, significantly improving developer experience and build times.
