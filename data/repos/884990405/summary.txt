fast-edn is a high-performance EDN (Extensible Data Notation) parser for Clojure applications that serves as a drop-in replacement for the standard clojure.edn library, delivering 6x faster parsing speeds. Targeting Clojure developers working with data serialization and configuration management, the library achieves JSON-equivalent parsing performance by eliminating character-by-character reading and regex dependencies that bottleneck the standard implementation. The parser maintains 100% compatibility with clojure.edn while providing enhanced error reporting with location context and line/column information. It supports reading from multiple input sources including strings, InputStreams, Files, and byte arrays, making it valuable for web applications, data processing pipelines, and any Clojure system requiring efficient EDN parsing for configuration files, API responses, or inter-service communication.
