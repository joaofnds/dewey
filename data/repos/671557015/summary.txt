nvim-origami is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that enhances code folding functionality for software developers working in text editors. It provides quality-of-life improvements for managing code folds including LSP-based folding with Treesitter fallback, intelligent keymap overloading for h/l keys to fold/unfold code, automatic folding of comments and imports on file open, enhanced foldtext with line counts while preserving syntax highlighting, search-aware fold pausing/restoration, and session-persistent fold state management. The plugin targets Neovim 0.11+ users and serves as a lightweight alternative to nvim-ufo, integrating with Language Server Protocol (LSP) providers and Treesitter parsers to deliver contextually-aware code folding across multiple programming languages, helping developers maintain cleaner code navigation and organization workflows.
