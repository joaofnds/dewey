RedisGraph was a graph database module that extended Redis with native graph data structure capabilities, implementing the openCypher query language for property graph operations. Built in C as a Redis module, it enabled developers and data engineers to perform complex graph traversals, pattern matching, and relationship queries directly within Redis infrastructure. The module targeted applications requiring real-time graph analytics, social network analysis, recommendation engines, and fraud detection systems where low-latency graph operations were critical. It solved the problem of integrating graph database functionality into existing Redis-based architectures without requiring separate graph database deployments, appealing to backend developers, data engineers, and system architects working with connected data in high-performance environments. The project is now deprecated and no longer maintained.
