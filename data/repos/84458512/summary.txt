RedisGraph is a graph database implemented as a Redis module, enabling graph data storage and querying within the Redis in-memory data structure store. This C-based module supports graph operations, including Cypher query language processing for graph traversals and property graph management. It functions as an extension to Redis, allowing users to integrate graph database capabilities into existing Redis deployments.
