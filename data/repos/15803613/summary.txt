**lispy** is an Emacs package that reimagines structural editing for LISP-family languages, providing single-keystroke commands for navigating and manipulating S-expressions. Built in Emacs Lisp, it targets software developers working with Clojure, Common Lisp, Scheme, Emacs Lisp, and Python codebases within the Emacs editor ecosystem. The package implements context-aware keybindings (a-z, A-Z) that activate when the cursor is positioned at parentheses boundaries or when regions are selected, enabling rapid code refactoring, navigation, evaluation, and structural transformations. It serves as an enhanced alternative to Paredit, solving the efficiency problem of verbose key combinations in traditional LISP editing by providing mnemonic single-character commands for operations like slurping, barfing, raising expressions, and tree navigation, significantly accelerating developer productivity in functional programming environments.
