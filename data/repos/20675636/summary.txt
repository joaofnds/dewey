Apache Parquet Java is the official Java implementation of the Parquet columnar storage format, designed for big data analytics and distributed computing environments. This library provides high-performance reading and writing capabilities for Parquet files, featuring advanced compression algorithms, encoding schemes (RLE, bit packing, dictionary encoding), and predicate pushdown optimization. It integrates with major big data frameworks including Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Spark, and supports multiple data serialization formats like Avro, Thrift, and Protocol Buffers. The library implements Google's Dremel paper algorithms for efficient nested data structure handling and targets data engineers, backend developers, and data platform architects working with large-scale data processing pipelines, ETL workflows, and analytical workloads requiring optimized columnar data storage and retrieval performance.
