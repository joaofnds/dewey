`apache/parquet-java` is a Java library implementing the Apache Parquet data file format, designed for efficient column-oriented storage and retrieval of large datasets. It provides features including type-specific encoding, compression, and integration with various data processing frameworks like Hadoop, Avro, Thrift, and Protobuf, enabling users to read and write data in the Parquet format. The project includes Map/Reduce input and output formats, along with experimental Java Vector API support for improved performance. As a library, it is intended for use by Java developers and data engineers working with large datasets, and the project facilitates integration with Apache Hive and Spark (through dependencies).
