ShellCheck is a static analysis tool written in Haskell that performs linting and code quality analysis for shell scripts (bash/sh). Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who write shell scripts, it identifies syntax errors, semantic issues, portability problems, and security vulnerabilities through comprehensive AST-based analysis. The tool integrates into CI/CD pipelines, editors (Vim, Emacs, VSCode), and development workflows via command-line interface or web interface. It addresses the common problem of cryptic shell script errors and unexpected behavior by providing detailed warnings and suggestions for script improvements, helping prevent production failures and enhancing shell script reliability across different environments and shell implementations.
