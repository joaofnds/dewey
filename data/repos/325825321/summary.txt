`doublet` is a TypeScript library designed to streamline error handling in JavaScript and TypeScript functions by returning results as error-response tuples. It enables developers to treat any function as returning an error and a value, avoiding the need for try/catch blocks. The core functionality revolves around providing a cleaner error flow by simplifying error propagation within asynchronous operations, as demonstrated in the example using `axios`. This library is primarily a developer productivity tool targeting JavaScript and TypeScript developers, particularly those building applications that require robust error handling.
