**doublet** is a TypeScript utility library that transforms JavaScript/TypeScript function calls into Go-style error-response tuples, eliminating the need for traditional try-catch blocks. Targeting web developers and Node.js applications, it wraps any function (synchronous or asynchronous) to return a `[error, result]` array instead of throwing exceptions. This functional programming approach prevents variable hoisting issues where developers must declare variables outside try-catch scopes to access results in subsequent code. The library is particularly useful for HTTP client operations, database queries, and API integrations where error handling is frequent. By providing a cleaner alternative to exception-based control flow, doublet enables more readable and maintainable error handling patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript codebases without requiring framework-specific implementations.
