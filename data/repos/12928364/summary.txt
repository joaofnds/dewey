`anzu.el` is an Emacs Lisp package that enhances text editor search functionality by displaying real-time match counts in the mode-line during search and replace operations. Targeting Emacs users and developers in text editing workflows, it provides visual feedback showing "current match/total matches" information for `isearch`, `query-replace`, and regexp-based search commands. The package implements enhanced versions of standard Emacs search functions with configurable overlays, faces, and thresholds, supporting advanced features like migemo integration for Japanese text processing. It solves the problem of search context awareness in large codebases or documents where users need immediate feedback about match quantities and current position within search results, making it particularly valuable for developers, writers, and anyone performing extensive text manipulation in Emacs.
