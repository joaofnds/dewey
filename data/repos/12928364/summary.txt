`anzu.el` is an Emacs Lisp package providing an Emacs port of the anzu.vim functionality, enhancing search and replace operations within the Emacs editor. It implements a minor mode displaying current and total match counts in the mode-line during various search modes, including `query-replace`, `query-replace-regexp`, and `isearch`. Key features include customizable mode-line display, support for regular expressions and `migemo`, and the ability to customize behavior such as thresholding search results and specifying replacement behavior. This plugin is designed for Emacs users seeking improved feedback and control over search and replace actions within their editing workflow.
