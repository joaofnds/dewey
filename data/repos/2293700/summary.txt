`cl-fad` is a portable pathname library for Common Lisp, providing a cross-platform abstraction for file system path manipulation. It facilitates operations such as path construction, decomposition, and testing, enabling developers to write more robust and portable Common Lisp code that interacts with the file system. As a library, it aims to simplify file and directory handling across diverse operating systems by offering a consistent interface for common pathname tasks. The project's core focus is on developer productivity and ease of use within Common Lisp environments.
