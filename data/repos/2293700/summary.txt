CL-FAD is a portable pathname manipulation library for Common Lisp that provides cross-platform file and directory operations. It abstracts filesystem interactions across different Common Lisp implementations and operating systems, offering consistent APIs for path handling, directory traversal, file operations, and pathname utilities. The library targets Common Lisp developers working on applications requiring robust file system manipulation, particularly those needing portability across Unix, Windows, and other platforms. It solves the problem of implementation-specific pathname handling differences in Common Lisp environments by providing a unified interface. The library integrates with standard Common Lisp build systems including ASDF, MK:DEFSYSTEM, and QuickLisp, making it accessible for system programmers, application developers, and anyone building Common Lisp software requiring reliable cross-platform file operations.
