Run.rb is a web application and developer tool that enables users to execute Ruby code directly within a web browser environment. It achieves this by compiling Ruby source code to WebAssembly (WASM), utilizing a modified Ruby version (currently 2.6.0) and associated tooling within a `/src/emscripten` directory. Built with JavaScript and initially bootstrapped with Create React App before being ejected for WASM integration, the project provides an online interface for Ruby code execution. The primary functionality revolves around compiling and running Ruby code in the browser, suggesting its focus on facilitating Ruby development and potentially targeting frontend developers or Ruby enthusiasts seeking a browser-based coding environment.
