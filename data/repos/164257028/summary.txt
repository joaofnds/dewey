Run.rb is a web-based Ruby code execution platform that compiles Ruby to WebAssembly for browser-based execution. Built on a React application framework (ejected from Create React App), it uses Emscripten toolchain with Docker to compile Ruby 2.6.0 into WASM modules. The project targets web developers and Ruby programmers who need to execute Ruby code directly in browsers without server-side infrastructure. It addresses the problem of running Ruby in client-side web environments where traditionally only JavaScript was supported. The technical stack combines WebAssembly compilation, React frontend development, and containerized build processes to create an online Ruby REPL and code sharing platform for educational and development purposes.
