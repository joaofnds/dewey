This JavaScript-based tool converts real source code into faux code representations, primarily generating SVG illustrations for design and presentation purposes. Targeting the design and web development domains, it addresses the common need for realistic-looking code snippets in mockups, presentations, and illustrations without exposing actual proprietary source code. The tool likely parses input code and transforms it into visually similar but semantically meaningless text while preserving syntax highlighting patterns and structural formatting. Built with JavaScript and SVG generation capabilities, it serves designers, front-end developers, and technical illustrators who need authentic-looking code visuals for client presentations, portfolio pieces, or educational materials without revealing sensitive implementation details or intellectual property.
