A JavaScript-based tool designed to transform existing code into syntactically similar, but non-functional, "faux code". It's likely a standalone web application based on the homepage, used for design and illustration purposes, potentially generating SVG output. The project's core functionality centers on code obfuscation or stylization to serve as a visual asset. The topics of "design," "illustration," and "svg" suggest integration with creative workflows, and the tool could serve as a developer productivity tool in the design space.
