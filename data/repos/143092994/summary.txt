py-spy is a cross-platform sampling profiler for Python applications, implemented in Rust for minimal performance overhead. It targets DevOps, performance engineering, and production debugging scenarios by enabling non-intrusive profiling of running Python processes without code modification or application restart. The tool uses low-level system calls (process_vm_readv on Linux, vm_read on macOS, ReadProcessMemory on Windows) to directly read Python interpreter memory and reconstruct call stacks from CPython's internal structures. It supports Python 2.3-2.7 and 3.3-3.13, generating flame graphs, speedscope profiles, and live performance dashboards. Primary users include site reliability engineers, Python developers, and system administrators who need to diagnose performance bottlenecks in production environments where traditional intrusive profiling methods are impractical due to performance impact constraints.
