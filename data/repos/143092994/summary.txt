`py-spy` is a standalone command-line application and performance profiler designed for analyzing Python programs. Written in Rust for speed and low overhead, it allows users to visualize the execution time of Python code without code modification or program restarts. Its core functionalities include recording profiles for flame graph generation, live top-like function monitoring, and call stack dumping, supporting CPython versions 2.3-2.7 and 3.3-3.13 across Linux, OSX, Windows, and FreeBSD. This project uses Rust and leverages system calls for memory access and stack unwinding to profile Python processes, targeting developers and system administrators for debugging and performance optimization in production environments.
