`delta` is a standalone, command-line application written in Rust that enhances the presentation of Git, diff, grep, and blame output. It functions as a syntax-highlighting pager, utilizing color themes compatible with `bat`, to improve the readability of diffs. Key features include word-level diff highlighting, side-by-side views, line numbering, navigation between diff sections, improved merge conflict and `git blame` displays, and support for terminal hyperlinks and customizable styling. This developer-focused tool is designed to be integrated as a Git core pager to enhance the developer workflow.
