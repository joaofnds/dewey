uv is a high-performance Python package and project manager written in Rust, designed to replace multiple Python toolchain components including pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, and virtualenv. It targets Python developers and DevOps engineers by providing 10-100x faster dependency resolution and installation compared to pip, comprehensive project management with universal lockfiles, Python version management, virtual environment handling, and script execution with inline dependency metadata. The tool implements a pip-compatible interface while adding Cargo-style workspace support for scalable projects, global caching for disk efficiency, and cross-platform compatibility. It addresses the fragmented Python tooling ecosystem by consolidating package management, project scaffolding, dependency resolution, and distribution publishing into a single Rust-based binary optimized for speed and reliability.
