Handlebars.js is a JavaScript templating engine for web development that compiles template strings into functions for generating dynamic HTML content. Built as an extension of Mustache templates, it provides semantic templating capabilities including nested paths, custom helpers, block expressions, and template precompilation for optimized runtime performance. The library operates in ECMAScript 2020 environments including Node.js and modern browsers, targeting frontend and fullstack JavaScript developers who need to separate presentation logic from data in web applications. Handlebars solves the problem of dynamic content rendering by allowing developers to create reusable templates with embedded expressions that interpolate data objects into structured HTML output, supporting both client-side and server-side rendering workflows in JavaScript-based web development stacks.
