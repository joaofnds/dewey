Neo.mjs is a JavaScript framework designed for building high-performance, scalable web applications by leveraging the off-main-thread (OMT) paradigm. It enables multi-threading within the browser, moving application logic, state management, and rendering to worker threads while the main thread focuses on DOM updates and UI event delegation. Key features include a declarative class configuration system, reactive state management, modular architecture supporting multi-window and single-page applications, and a development mode that eliminates builds and transpilation. This framework is targeted at frontend developers seeking to create responsive and extensible web applications, including data-intensive dashboards, real-time applications, and enterprise solutions.
