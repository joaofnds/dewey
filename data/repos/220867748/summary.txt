Neo.mjs is a multithreaded frontend JavaScript framework that implements the Off Main Thread (OMT) paradigm by running application logic, components, and state management inside Web Workers while keeping the main thread dedicated to DOM updates and UI event delegation. Targeting web developers building data-intensive SPAs and multi-window applications, it uses ES8+ modules, Virtual DOM, SharedWorkers, and OffscreenCanvas to eliminate UI blocking during computationally intensive tasks. The framework provides a declarative class configuration system and modular architecture for building scalable enterprise web applications, dashboards, and real-time interfaces where UI responsiveness is critical, serving as an alternative to traditional single-threaded frameworks like React and Angular.
