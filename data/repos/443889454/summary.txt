`nvim-neotest/neotest` is a Lua framework designed to streamline test interaction within the NeoVim text editor. It enables users to run, debug, and visualize test results for various testing frameworks by leveraging adapters specific to each runner, including pytest, Jest, and others. Core functionalities include output and summary windows, diagnostic message integration, and status signs for test visibility. This framework relies on Lua as its primary language, integrates with NeoVim, and leverages dependencies such as `nvim-nio` and `plenary.nvim` to enhance test management capabilities. It functions as a plugin, extending NeoVim's functionality for developers working with test-driven development.
