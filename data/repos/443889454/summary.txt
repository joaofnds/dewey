Neotest is an extensible testing framework for NeoVim that provides a unified interface for running and managing tests across multiple programming languages and test runners within the editor. Built in Lua, it leverages nvim-treesitter for code parsing and supports over 25 different test adapters including pytest, Jest, Go test, RSpec, PHPUnit, and Rust cargo test. The framework offers features like per-test execution, real-time output display, diagnostic integration, status indicators, and summary windows for test results. It solves the problem of fragmented testing workflows by providing developers with consistent test management capabilities directly in their editor, eliminating context switching between terminal and IDE. The architecture uses adapter patterns to extend support for new test runners, making it particularly valuable for polyglot development teams and developers working across multiple testing frameworks who need seamless test execution, debugging, and result visualization within their NeoVim environment.
