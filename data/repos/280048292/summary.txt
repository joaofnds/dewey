coq_nvim is a high-performance autocompletion engine for Neovim that provides real-time code completion across multiple sources including LSP servers, TreeSitter, CTags, file paths, and code snippets. Built primarily in Python with SQLite for caching and native C B-trees for memory management, it features a coroutine-based scheduler with TCP-like flow control for sub-millisecond response times. The plugin integrates with Language Server Protocol implementations, supports over 9,000 built-in snippets with LSP/Vim grammar compatibility, and includes fuzzy search with typo correction and proximity ranking. Targeting software developers across all programming languages and frameworks, it solves the latency and feature limitations of traditional Vim/Neovim completion systems by leveraging concurrent processing, incremental parsing, and intelligent caching to deliver comprehensive autocompletion without blocking the editor interface.
