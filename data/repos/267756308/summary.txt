Carta is a SQL data mapper library for Go that automatically handles complex object-relational mapping scenarios involving nested struct relationships. It specializes in mapping SQL query results with JOIN operations to Go structs while preserving has-one and has-many relationships, eliminating the need for multiple queries or manual post-processing. The library supports PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, works with standard Go database/sql interfaces, and handles primitive types, time.Time, protobuf timestamps, and sql.NullX types. Unlike full ORMs like GORM, Carta focuses specifically on the data mapping layer, and unlike sqlx, it automatically manages relational data complexity. Target users are Go backend developers building database-driven applications who need efficient SQL result mapping without the overhead of a complete ORM framework.
