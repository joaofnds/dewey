Realm is a mobile-first NoSQL database implementation for JavaScript and TypeScript that provides local data persistence for React Native, Node.js, and Electron applications. Built as an alternative to SQLite and key-value stores, it offers object-relational mapping with direct JavaScript object exposure, eliminating traditional ORM complexity. The repository targets mobile and cross-platform developers building data-driven applications requiring offline-first capabilities, real-time synchronization, and reactive data queries. Key features include TypeScript class-to-schema transformation via Babel plugins, React hooks integration through @realm/react, and MongoDB Atlas Device Sync for cloud synchronization. The database runs directly on mobile devices, tablets, and wearables, providing faster performance than SQLite while supporting relationships, generics, and advanced querying capabilities for modern mobile application development.
