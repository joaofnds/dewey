Clozure Common Lisp (CCL) is a high-performance Common Lisp implementation and compiler targeting software developers who require a robust Lisp development environment. Built as a self-hosting compiler (written in Common Lisp itself), CCL provides native code compilation, interactive development capabilities, and standards-compliant Common Lisp functionality across multiple platforms. The system serves developers in domains requiring symbolic computation, artificial intelligence research, rapid prototyping, and systems programming where Lisp's metaprogramming capabilities and REPL-driven development are advantageous. CCL addresses the need for a production-ready Common Lisp compiler with modern features, garbage collection, and cross-platform compatibility, enabling developers to build and deploy Lisp applications efficiently while maintaining the language's interactive development paradigm and powerful macro system.
