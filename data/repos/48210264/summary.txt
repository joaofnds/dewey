Clozure CL (`ccl`) is a Common Lisp implementation, serving as a compiler and runtime environment for the Common Lisp programming language. This project enables the execution of Common Lisp code, providing features inherent to a Lisp compiler, such as code compilation, interpretation, and memory management. It's a standalone application (implementation) for Common Lisp programmers and developers, allowing them to write, compile, and execute Common Lisp programs.
