Claude Code is a terminal-based AI coding assistant built on Node.js that integrates with Anthropic's Claude API to provide contextual code assistance through natural language commands. Targeting software developers across various programming domains, it functions as an agentic tool that analyzes entire codebases to perform automated code editing, bug fixing, test execution, and git workflow management including merge conflict resolution and commit generation. The tool operates through OAuth authentication with Claude Max or Anthropic Console accounts and processes developer feedback while implementing data retention policies that exclude training data usage. It addresses the core developer productivity challenge of routine coding tasks by combining large language model capabilities with deep codebase understanding and version control integration.
