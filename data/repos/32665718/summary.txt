Upterm, a deprecated project, was a standalone, cross-platform terminal emulator built with Electron.  It provided a graphical user interface for interacting with a shell, including features such as autocompletion and integration with command-line tools like `vim` and `emacs`. The application was developed using TypeScript, React, and leverages a `pty` (pseudo-terminal) for shell interaction.  It targeted developers seeking an enhanced terminal experience beyond standard command-line interfaces.
