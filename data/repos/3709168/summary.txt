Gambit is a complete, portable, and efficient implementation of the Scheme programming language, targeting general-purpose programming. It provides a robust runtime environment and supports a wide range of Scheme Request for Implementation (SRFI) standards, including list manipulation, string processing, multithreading, and various data structures like hash tables and vectors. This project enables the execution of Scheme code and serves as a foundation for developing Scheme-based applications, including a compiler (gsc) and interpreter (gsi). It is a standalone application and development environment for Scheme programmers.
