Gambit is a high-performance implementation of the Scheme programming language, targeting developers working in functional programming, research, and systems development domains. Built as a complete Scheme system with both interpreter (gsi) and compiler (gsc) components, it provides R7RS compliance and extensive SRFI (Scheme Request for Implementation) support including multithreading, homogeneous numeric vectors, and string processing libraries. The system compiles to native code for optimal performance and includes advanced features like single-host compilation and dynamic C library integration. Gambit addresses the need for efficient Scheme execution in academic research, language implementation studies, and applications requiring Lisp-family language capabilities, serving computer science researchers, programming language enthusiasts, and developers building symbolic computation or AI systems requiring functional programming paradigms.
