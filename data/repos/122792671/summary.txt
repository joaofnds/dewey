This repository provides NestJS integration modules for Bull and BullMQ job queue systems, enabling Node.js backend developers to implement robust background job processing within the NestJS framework ecosystem. Built with TypeScript, it serves the web development domain by solving asynchronous task management challenges such as email processing, data processing, scheduled jobs, and cron-based operations in server-side applications. The modules act as adapters between NestJS's dependency injection system and Redis-backed queue libraries (Bull/BullMQ), allowing developers to leverage decorators, processors, and NestJS's modular architecture for queue management. Target users are Node.js backend developers and system architects building scalable web applications who need to offload time-consuming operations from HTTP request cycles while maintaining type safety and framework consistency.
