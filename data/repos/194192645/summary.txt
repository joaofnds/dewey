`PLDB` is a JavaScript-based project acting as a Programming Language DataBase, leveraging a knowledge graph approach. It likely functions as a web-based database providing structured information and relationships concerning various programming languages, accessible via its website (pldb.io).  The project's focus on `data` and `knowledge-graph` functionalities suggests it enables querying and exploration of programming language information. This is a standalone application, potentially a web application, targeting developers and researchers interested in programming languages and their interconnections.
