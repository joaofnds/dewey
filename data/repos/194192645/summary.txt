PLDB (Programming Language Database) is a comprehensive knowledge graph and dataset containing over 135,000 structured facts about 5,000+ programming languages, implemented as a JavaScript-based web application. The system targets programming language researchers, creators, and users by providing structured metadata including language features, user estimates, job market data, and influence metrics through CSV/TSV/JSON APIs and a web interface at pldb.io. Built using ScrollSet format for data storage and TrueBase for data management, PLDB solves the problem of fragmented programming language information by centralizing historical and contemporary language data with sophisticated ranking algorithms. The public domain dataset serves language designers making informed decisions and developers seeking data-driven insights about the programming language ecosystem, functioning as both a research database and analytical platform for the software development community.
