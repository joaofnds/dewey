ddcctl is a command-line utility written in C for macOS that enables programmatic control of external monitors through DDC (Display Data Channel) protocol communication. Targeting system administrators and power users in desktop computing environments, it provides shell-based access to monitor hardware controls including brightness, contrast, input source switching, speaker volume, and color settings without requiring manufacturer-specific software. The tool leverages macOS Core Graphics frameworks and DDC-CI (Command Interface) standards to communicate directly with compatible external displays via I2C bus protocols. It addresses the need for automated monitor management in multi-display setups, particularly useful for workflow automation through integration with tools like Alfred, ControlPlane, or shell scripting, enabling users to programmatically adjust display parameters that are typically only accessible through physical monitor buttons or vendor-specific GUI applications.
