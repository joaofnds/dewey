`ddcctl` is a command-line utility written in C designed to control the brightness and contrast of external monitors connected to macOS systems via DDC (Display Data Channel). It provides functionality to adjust monitor settings directly from the command line, including input source selection and, potentially, speaker volume and color adjustments if the monitor supports them. The tool is delivered as a standalone command-line application, enabling users to script monitor control or integrate it with automation tools like Alfred or ControlPlane. The project leverages the DDC-CI protocol and builds upon prior work in this domain, targeting users who need fine-grained control over their external displays from the command line on macOS.
