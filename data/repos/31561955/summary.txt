zsh-async is a shell scripting library that enables asynchronous task execution within the Zsh shell environment without requiring external dependencies. Built for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and shell script developers, it leverages Zsh's built-in `zsh/zpty` pseudo-terminal functionality to create background worker processes that can execute commands concurrently while maintaining parent-child process control. The library addresses the common shell scripting problem of blocking command execution by providing a worker-callback architecture where jobs are dispatched to separate environments and results are returned through registered callback functions via SIGWINCH signals or ZLE watchers. Key features include unique job enforcement, multiple worker management, job flushing capabilities, and non-blocking result processing, making it particularly valuable for terminal-based applications, prompt customization, and automated system administration tasks that require responsive user interfaces.
