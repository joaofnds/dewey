`zsh-async` is a Shell library enabling asynchronous task execution within the Zsh shell without external dependencies. It facilitates running multiple concurrent jobs, enforcing unique job instances, and managing workers with callbacks for result handling.  The library leverages `zsh/zpty` to launch pseudo-terminals for executing commands, mitigating terminal clutter and providing granular control over child processes. Core functionalities include initializing workers, submitting jobs, registering callbacks, and flushing or stopping workers; it's designed to improve developer productivity within the Zsh environment, solving problems related to blocking terminal operations.
