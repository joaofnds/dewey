Qoa is a lightweight JavaScript library for creating interactive command-line interfaces (CLIs) in Node.js applications. Built with zero external dependencies and weighing only 8.8kB, it provides seven configurable prompt types including text input, password/secure input, confirmation dialogs, single keypress handlers, quiz interfaces, and navigable multiple-choice menus. The library leverages async/await patterns and targets CLI developers, DevOps engineers, and Node.js application developers who need to collect user input through terminal interfaces. Qoa solves the problem of building interactive command-line tools without heavy dependencies, offering a minimal API for creating prompts that handle user authentication, configuration collection, and interactive decision-making workflows in terminal-based applications and automation scripts.
