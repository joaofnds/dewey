Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based management interface for Kubernetes clusters, built in Go and designed for the DevOps and container orchestration domain. It provides system administrators and DevOps engineers with a graphical user interface to manage containerized applications, troubleshoot cluster issues, and perform cluster administration tasks without requiring command-line kubectl interactions. The application uses a multi-container architecture with Kong API gateway as a proxy, supports only Helm-based deployment, and integrates with Kubernetes RBAC for access control. It solves the complexity of managing Kubernetes resources through CLI by offering an intuitive web UI that visualizes workloads, services, pods, and cluster health, making Kubernetes cluster management accessible to users who prefer graphical interfaces over command-line tools.
