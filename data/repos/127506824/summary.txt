ccls is a C/C++/Objective-C language server implementing the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to provide advanced IDE functionality for systems programming and native development. Built in C++ and originating from the cquery project, it serves software developers working with C-family languages by offering comprehensive code intelligence features including cross-references, call/inheritance hierarchies, code completion with signature help, symbol navigation, semantic highlighting, and real-time diagnostics. The server performs whole-project indexing with parallel processing capabilities, maintaining a global codebase view to enable sophisticated refactoring operations like symbol renaming and definition/reference lookups. It integrates with LSP-compatible editors and IDEs, solving the challenge of providing robust IntelliSense-like functionality for large-scale C/C++ codebases including complex projects like LLVM, Linux kernel, and FreeBSD with efficient memory usage.
