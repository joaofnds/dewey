This repository provides a command-line code formatter specifically designed for Scheme Lisp dialects, implemented in Chicken Scheme 5.x. It targets software developers working in functional programming and Lisp ecosystems who need automated code standardization tools. The formatter handles indentation, line breaks, and alphabetical sorting of function definitions while preserving program semantics, aiming for compliance with the scheme-style guide. Key features include in-place file editing via the `-i` flag, standard output formatting, and integration capabilities with text editors. Built using Chicken Scheme's compilation system (csc), it addresses the common development workflow problem of maintaining consistent code style across Scheme projects, similar to how tools like Prettier serve JavaScript developers or gofmt serves Go developers in their respective language ecosystems.
