`evil-rails` is an Emacs Lisp extension providing Rails-specific navigation and command support within the Emacs editor. It replicates the functionality of `rails.vim` for Emacs, integrating with `evil-mode` for Vim-like keybindings and `projectile-rails` for project navigation. This plugin offers commands to quickly locate Rails models, controllers, views, tests, and other project files, supporting features like file navigation, partial extraction, and console/server interaction, with a focus on improving developer productivity within a Ruby on Rails development workflow. It functions as an Emacs plugin, specifically targeting developers working on Ruby on Rails applications.
