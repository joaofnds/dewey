Evil Rails is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a Vim-style command interface for Ruby on Rails development within Emacs, specifically targeting web developers who prefer modal editing. Built on top of evil-mode and projectile-rails, it implements Ex-commands (like :Rmodel, :Rcontroller, :Rview) that mirror the popular rails.vim plugin functionality for navigating Rails MVC architecture components. The package enables rapid file switching between models, controllers, views, helpers, specs, migrations, and other Rails project files using Vim-like colon commands while leveraging Emacs' projectile completion system. It addresses the workflow needs of Rails developers who want Vim-style navigation commands within the Emacs ecosystem, providing seamless integration with Rails project structure and development tasks like running console, server, rake tasks, and generators.
