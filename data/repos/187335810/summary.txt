Lazydocker is a terminal-based user interface for Docker and Docker Compose management, built in Go using the gocui library. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers working with containerized applications, it provides an interactive TUI alternative to command-line Docker operations. The tool simplifies container lifecycle management, allowing users to view, start, stop, and monitor Docker containers and services through keyboard-driven navigation rather than memorizing complex CLI commands. It addresses the cognitive overhead of Docker's extensive command syntax by presenting container states, logs, and metrics in a unified dashboard interface. The application integrates directly with Docker's API to provide real-time container monitoring, resource usage visualization, and streamlined multi-container orchestration management for development and deployment workflows.
