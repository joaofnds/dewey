Firecracker is a virtualization technology for creating and managing secure, multi-tenant container and function workloads for serverless computing.  Built in Rust, it implements a minimalist microVM monitor leveraging KVM to provide the security and isolation of hardware virtualization with the speed of containers.  Key functionalities include API-driven microVM configuration, network interface management, block device control, resource limiting, and guest-facing metadata service capabilities, all designed to enable fast startup times, efficient hardware utilization, and a reduced attack surface. It functions as a standalone application enabling developers to build and deploy serverless architectures.
