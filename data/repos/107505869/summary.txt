Firecracker is a Rust-based Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) that creates lightweight microVMs for serverless computing infrastructure. Built on Linux KVM, it provides hardware-level isolation with container-like performance for multi-tenant workloads. The project targets cloud infrastructure engineers and platform developers building serverless platforms, container runtimes, and Function-as-a-Service offerings. Firecracker's minimalist design excludes unnecessary virtualization components to reduce memory footprint, attack surface, and startup latency while enabling secure workload isolation. It integrates with container orchestration systems like Kata Containers and powers AWS Lambda and Fargate production workloads, addressing the core infrastructure challenge of balancing security isolation with resource efficiency in serverless computing environments.
