The Backstage Upgrade Helper is a TypeScript-based web tool designed to assist developers in upgrading their Backstage applications between versions. Built as a React web application, it leverages automated diff generation from the backstage/upgrade-helper-diff repository to provide comprehensive change sets between any two Backstage releases. The tool presents file-by-file comparisons with inline comments, progress tracking capabilities, and binary file downloads to guide developers through the upgrade process. Targeting Backstage platform developers and DevOps engineers working with developer portals, it addresses the complex challenge of maintaining Backstage applications across version updates by providing clean, templated diffs based on fresh CLI-generated projects. The solution integrates react-diff-view for visualization and follows patterns established by the React Native upgrade tooling ecosystem.
