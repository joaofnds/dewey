The `backstage/upgrade-helper` project is a web-based developer tool designed to assist Backstage developers in upgrading their Backstage applications. It analyzes differences between Backstage application versions, leveraging the `upgrade-helper-diff` project to provide detailed change sets. Functionality includes inline comments with insights, links to further documentation, a file-tracking system, and binary file downloads. Built with TypeScript and likely utilizing React, it is a standalone web application intended for developers working with the Backstage platform.
