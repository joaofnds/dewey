Selene is a Ruby library designed to parse iCalendar (RFC 5545) formatted strings into a serializable hash representation. It provides a programmatic interface for reading and processing calendar data in the iCalendar format, allowing developers to integrate calendar functionality within their Ruby applications. Installation is facilitated through RubyGems, and example usage is demonstrated via direct parsing of a file containing iCalendar data. The library targets Ruby developers needing to interact with iCalendar data within their Ruby projects.
