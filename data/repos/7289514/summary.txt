Selene is a Ruby library that parses iCalendar (.ics) files conforming to RFC 5545 specification and converts them into serializable hash structures. Targeting web developers and calendar application builders, it solves the common problem of integrating calendar data from various sources (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar) into Ruby applications. The library provides a simple API through `Selene.parse()` method that takes iCalendar-formatted strings as input and outputs structured Ruby hashes suitable for JSON serialization or database storage. This addresses the need for calendar data interoperability in web applications, content management systems, and scheduling platforms where developers need to process standardized calendar feeds without implementing complex RFC 5545 parsing logic themselves.
