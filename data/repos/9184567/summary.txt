vim-rspec is a lightweight Vim plugin that enables Ruby developers to execute RSpec test suites directly from within the Vim editor without switching to terminal windows. Built using Vim Script, it provides key mappings and commands to run individual spec files, nearest specs based on cursor position, previously executed specs, or entire test suites. The plugin integrates with various Ruby testing workflows through customizable command configurations, supporting test runners like Zeus, DRB, and vim-dispatch, with specialized runners for macOS Terminal and iTerm. Targeting Ruby on Rails and Ruby web developers who use Vim as their primary editor, it streamlines test-driven development workflows by eliminating context switching between editor and terminal during the red-green-refactor cycle.
