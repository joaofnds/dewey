Cobalt2 for VS Code is a color theme extension that provides syntax highlighting and UI customization for Visual Studio Code editors. Targeting web developers and general programmers, it implements a dark blue color scheme with yellow, pink, and orange accent colors optimized for code readability and extended coding sessions. The theme is distributed through the VS Code Marketplace and includes JSON-based theme definitions, recommended editor settings for typography (including support for Operator Mono font), and comprehensive color mappings for various programming languages and VS Code interface elements. The extension addresses developer productivity by reducing eye strain and improving code legibility through carefully chosen contrast ratios and semantic color coding for different syntax elements across multiple programming languages.
