This repository provides a comprehensive style guide for Emacs Lisp programming, targeting developers who write extensions, packages, and configurations for the Emacs text editor ecosystem. The guide covers code formatting conventions, indentation rules, naming conventions, macro usage, function design, documentation standards, and tooling recommendations specific to Emacs Lisp development. It addresses the problem of inconsistent coding practices across the Emacs community by establishing standardized guidelines for source code layout, syntax patterns, comment formatting, and docstring conventions. The resource is designed for Emacs Lisp developers, package maintainers, and contributors to the GNU Emacs ecosystem who need to write maintainable, readable code that follows community-accepted best practices for this domain-specific Lisp dialect used in editor customization and extension development.
