Alchemist.el is an Emacs package that provides comprehensive development tooling integration for the Elixir programming language, targeting web developers and functional programming practitioners working in the Elixir/Phoenix ecosystem. Built in Emacs Lisp, it integrates core Elixir development workflows including Mix build tool support, IEx REPL interaction, inline code evaluation and macro expansion, documentation and definition lookup, intelligent code completion via company-mode, and Phoenix web framework support. The package addresses the need for a unified development environment within Emacs for Elixir projects, eliminating context switching between editors and command-line tools by embedding compilation, testing, project management, and interactive development capabilities directly into the editor, primarily serving Elixir developers who prefer Emacs as their primary development environment.
