Xray is an experimental, next-generation text editor built on Electron, aiming to improve upon the Atom editor with enhanced performance and collaborative features. Its core functionality revolves around real-time collaborative editing and high performance, achieved through its operation-based version control system called Memo, which tracks changes at the keystroke level, and also provides real-time synchronization of branches. The editor's architecture leverages web technologies for the UI, while core application logic is written in Rust, using a copy-on-write CRDT for text storage to facilitate concurrency. This project is a standalone GUI application, focusing on extensibility and a web-compatible editing experience and targets developers.
