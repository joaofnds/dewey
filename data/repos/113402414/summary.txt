Xray is an experimental, next-generation text editor built with Electron and Rust, designed as a high-performance successor to Atom for software developers. The project implements a hybrid architecture where the UI layer uses web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for cross-platform extensibility, while core application logic is written in Rust for performance optimization. Key features include real-time collaborative editing capabilities, a sub-project called Memo that provides operation-based version control tracking individual keystrokes, and APIs for extensibility. The editor targets web developers and software engineers who need a responsive, collaborative coding environment with browser compatibility. Though archived by GitHub, it represents an advanced approach to building performant web-based development tools using systems programming languages for computational heavy-lifting.
