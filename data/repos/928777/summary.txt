nREPL is a network-based Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) server implementation for Clojure that enables remote code evaluation and interactive development. Targeting Clojure developers and IDE tooling authors, it provides a language-agnostic protocol for establishing client-server communication between development environments and running Clojure processes. The system facilitates remote debugging, live code evaluation, and interactive development workflows through a stable, backwards-compatible API. It serves as the foundational infrastructure for popular Clojure development tools like CIDER, Calva, and vim-fireplace, enabling features such as code completion, documentation lookup, and runtime introspection. While primarily focused on Clojure, the protocol supports extensions for ClojureScript via middleware and has implementations across multiple programming languages, making it a critical component in the Clojure development ecosystem.
