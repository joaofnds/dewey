Dolt is a Git-compatible version control system for SQL databases, implemented in Go, that applies distributed version control concepts to structured data management. It functions as a MySQL-compatible database server while enabling users to fork, clone, branch, merge, push, and pull database schemas and data using familiar Git commands. The system targets data engineers, database administrators, and data scientists who need to track changes in relational data over time, collaborate on database modifications, and maintain data lineage. Dolt exposes version control functionality through both a command-line interface mirroring Git operations and SQL system tables/procedures, solving the problem of database change management and collaborative data workflows that traditional SQL databases cannot address natively.
