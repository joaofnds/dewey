`Bytehound` is a memory profiler for Linux systems, written in C, designed to identify and analyze memory usage patterns, including leaks and fragmentation. It captures allocations and deallocations with full stack traces, supports dynamic culling of temporary allocations for long-duration profiling, and exports data in formats like JSON, Heaptrack, and flamegraphs.  The project features a web-based GUI for analysis and supports AMD64, ARM, AArch64, and MIPS64 architectures, as well as integration with jemalloc. The tool is primarily a command-line application and supporting library for developers focused on optimizing the memory performance of their applications.
