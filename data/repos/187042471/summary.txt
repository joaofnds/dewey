Bytehound is a high-performance memory profiler specifically designed for Linux systems, targeting systems programming and application performance optimization domains. Built with Rust and C, it uses LD_PRELOAD library injection to intercept memory allocations and provides comprehensive memory analysis through stack trace collection, leak detection, and fragmentation analysis. The tool features a custom stack unwinding implementation for reduced overhead, supports multiple architectures (AMD64, ARM, AArch64, MIPS64), and offers multiple export formats including JSON, Heaptrack, and flamegraphs. It includes a web-based GUI built with modern web technologies and supports remote profiling for memory-constrained environments. Bytehound is primarily used by systems developers, performance engineers, and DevOps professionals for debugging memory issues, optimizing allocation patterns, and conducting long-term memory profiling of native applications.
