`magefile/mage` is a build automation tool that provides a Go-based alternative to Makefiles and Rakefiles. It allows developers to define build processes using plain Go functions, which are then automatically exposed as runnable targets. This project facilitates cross-platform build script creation and execution, eliminating dependencies on shell scripting for common build tasks. As a standalone CLI application, it targets Go developers seeking to streamline build and development workflows with Go's built-in features and a familiar syntax.
