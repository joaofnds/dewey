Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library designed for runtime data validation and static type inference. It allows developers to define schemas for data structures, enabling type-safe parsing and validation of inputs, ensuring data integrity and preventing runtime errors. Key features include zero external dependencies, a concise and immutable API, and built-in JSON Schema conversion. As a developer productivity library, it's intended for use in both Node.js and modern web browsers, simplifying data validation workflows for TypeScript projects by providing a type-safe way to work with untrusted data.
