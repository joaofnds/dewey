Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library designed for web development and full-stack JavaScript applications. It provides runtime data validation with compile-time type inference, allowing developers to define schemas that simultaneously validate untrusted data and generate static TypeScript types. The library targets JavaScript/TypeScript developers building APIs, form handlers, and data pipelines who need to validate external inputs like HTTP requests, user forms, or third-party API responses. Zod solves the dual problem of runtime safety and type safety by bridging the gap between TypeScript's static type system and dynamic runtime validation. With zero dependencies and a 2KB core bundle, it supports both Node.js and browser environments, offering features like error handling, async validation, schema composition, and JSON Schema conversion for modern web application development.
