CUELSP is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation written in Go that provides IDE integration and developer tooling for the CUE configuration language, with specialized support for Dagger workflows. Targeting DevOps engineers and infrastructure developers, it enables code editor features like jump-to-definition, documentation hover, and CUE plan loading across multiple files within popular editors including VS Code and Vim. The server addresses the need for improved developer experience when working with CUE's data validation and configuration templating capabilities, particularly in cloud infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline contexts where Dagger is used for portable development workflows.
