`git-flight-rules` is a developer productivity tool providing a comprehensive guide to handling various Git scenarios and troubleshooting common issues. It serves as a detailed reference, drawing parallels to NASA's flight rules, and offers step-by-step instructions for tasks such as repository management (cloning, forking, remotes), commit manipulation (amending, reverting), staging, discarding changes, branch operations, merging, rebasing, stashing, and debugging. Primarily presented in a README file format with multi-language support, this documentation project aims to assist Git users, covering command-line usage and essential workflows applicable to any Git-based project.
