`go-git` is a highly extensible Git implementation library written in pure Go. It provides a Go API for manipulating Git repositories at both low-level (plumbing) and high-level (porcelain) operations, supporting various storage types via the `Storer` interface. The library offers core Git functionality, including cloning, logging, and repository management, aiming for compatibility with standard Git. This library is primarily a Go package targeting developers who require Git functionality within their Go applications or tools, such as Keybase, Gitea, and Pulumi, offering a way to integrate Git features programmatically.
