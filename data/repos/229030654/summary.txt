go-git is a pure Go implementation of the Git version control system, providing both low-level (plumbing) and high-level (porcelain) APIs for programmatic Git repository manipulation. Targeting DevOps engineers, backend developers, and tooling maintainers, it enables direct Git operations within Go applications without external Git binary dependencies. The library supports multiple storage backends including in-memory filesystems and custom implementations through its Storer interface, making it suitable for cloud-native applications, CI/CD pipelines, and automated Git workflows. Used by production systems like Keybase, Gitea, and Pulumi, it addresses the need for Git functionality in distributed systems, repository automation tools, and applications requiring embedded version control capabilities without shell command execution overhead.
