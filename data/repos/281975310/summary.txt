type-challenges is a curated collection of TypeScript type system challenges designed to enhance developers' understanding of advanced TypeScript typing concepts. The repository functions as an educational platform with an integrated online judge system, featuring progressively difficult challenges categorized from warm-up to extreme difficulty levels. It targets TypeScript developers, frontend engineers, and type system enthusiasts who want to master complex type manipulations including conditional types, mapped types, template literal types, and recursive type definitions. The platform operates in TypeScript's strict mode and includes a playground plugin for the official TypeScript Playground, enabling developers to practice advanced type-level programming techniques. Challenges cover practical scenarios like utility type implementation, tuple manipulation, string parsing at the type level, and complex type transformations that mirror real-world TypeScript development patterns.
