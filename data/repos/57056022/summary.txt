org-kanban is an Emacs Lisp package that implements a Kanban board visualization system within org-mode, targeting productivity-focused developers and project managers who use Emacs for task management. The package creates dynamic blocks that render TODO items from org-mode files as interactive Kanban tables, allowing users to visualize and manipulate task workflows directly within their existing org-mode documents. It leverages org-mode's dynamic block functionality to automatically generate mirrored Kanban boards that reflect the current state of TODO keywords, providing operations like `org-kanban/shift` to move tasks between workflow states. The solution addresses the need for visual project management within the Emacs ecosystem, eliminating the requirement to switch between separate task management tools and maintaining workflow state persistence through standard org-mode file formats.
