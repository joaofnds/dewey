`tsafe` is a TypeScript utility library providing a collection of type-safe utilities to enhance developer productivity. It offers assertion functions and other tools that extend TypeScript's type system, enabling features like compile-time type validation, ensuring type equality, and preventing forgotten switch cases. The library is designed as both an npm and Deno module and leverages TypeScript's assertion functions and user-defined type guards to provide "missing builtins". It targets TypeScript developers seeking to improve type safety and streamline their development workflows.
