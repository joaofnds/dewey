TSafe is a TypeScript utility library that provides essential type-safety functions and assertion utilities missing from the core TypeScript runtime. Built for TypeScript developers working in web development environments, it offers utilities like type assertion functions, exhaustive switch case checking, type equality validation, schema matching for Zod integration, and user-defined type guards. The library targets TypeScript developers needing compile-time and runtime type safety validation, particularly those building type-safe APIs, data validation pipelines, and robust web applications. It supports both Node.js/NPM and Deno environments, providing tree-shakable imports for minimal bundle impact. TSafe solves the gap between TypeScript's compile-time type system and runtime validation needs, enabling developers to write more reliable code with proper type narrowing and assertion capabilities.
