**sc-im** is a terminal-based spreadsheet calculator built in C using ncurses, designed as a vim-like alternative to traditional GUI spreadsheet applications. Targeting system administrators, data analysts, and terminal-power-users who prefer command-line workflows, it provides a full-featured spreadsheet environment with vim keybindings for cell navigation and editing. The application supports standard spreadsheet operations including formulas, data import/export (CSV, XLSX, ODS), scripting via Lua integration, plotting through GNUplot, clipboard operations, and advanced features like undo/redo, filtering, and sorting. It solves the problem of spreadsheet manipulation in headless environments or for users who want spreadsheet functionality without leaving the terminal, supporting up to 65,536 rows and 702 columns with wide character support for international alphabets.
