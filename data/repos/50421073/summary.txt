`ActsAsBookable` is a Ruby on Rails plugin designed to enable booking functionality for resources within Rails applications. It provides an MVC solution built as a Rails engine, allowing developers to define bookable models and bookers, managing bookings with flexible time and capacity constraints.  Key features include support for time-based booking using IceCube schedules (fixed or range), capacity management with open or closed models, and the ability to define custom booking behaviors via configuration options. This library targets Ruby on Rails developers needing to implement reservation systems, with a focus on modularity and diverse use cases such as hotel bookings and event management.
