ActsAsBookable is a Ruby on Rails engine that provides a comprehensive reservation and booking system for web applications through ActiveRecord models and database migrations. It implements a three-entity MVC architecture with Bookable resources, Booker users, and Booking records, enabling Rails developers to add booking functionality to applications across domains like hotel reservations, restaurant bookings, and event scheduling. The plugin leverages the ice_cube gem for recurring availability schedules and exceptions, supports configurable time constraints (none, fixed, range) and capacity management (open, closed), and integrates seamlessly with existing Rails applications through engine-based installation. Target users are Ruby on Rails developers building web applications that require resource reservation capabilities, offering a drop-in solution that handles complex booking logic, availability management, and temporal scheduling without requiring custom implementation of reservation systems.
