Valkey is a high-performance, distributed key-value database server written in C, forked from Redis before its license transition. It serves as an in-memory data structure store optimized for caching and real-time workloads in web applications and distributed systems. The system supports multiple native data structures, extensible plugins, and operates across Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms with both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Key features include TLS encryption, experimental RDMA support, cluster mode, and sentinel high-availability. Built with configurable memory allocators (jemalloc/libc malloc) and POSIX threading, it targets backend developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who need fast, scalable NoSQL storage for session management, application caching, message queuing, and real-time data processing in cloud-native and microservices architectures.
