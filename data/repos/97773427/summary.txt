Architect is a JavaScript-based infrastructure-as-code framework that enables web developers to build and deploy serverless applications on AWS using a simplified configuration syntax. It abstracts AWS services including Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB into a declarative manifest format, providing local development workflows with offline sandbox environments that mirror production infrastructure. The framework supports multiple runtime languages (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, .NET, Go) and handles the complete deployment pipeline from local development to production staging on AWS serverless architecture. Architect targets full-stack web developers who want to build scalable database-backed web applications without managing server infrastructure, offering a streamlined alternative to complex AWS CloudFormation templates while maintaining the power of serverless computing for functional web application development.
