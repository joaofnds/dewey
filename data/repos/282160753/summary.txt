This Clojure-based repository serves as a curated collection of thematic name lists designed for automated software naming processes across development workflows. Targeting software developers, DevOps engineers, and release managers, it addresses the common challenge of programmatically generating meaningful names for services, products, releases, and components by providing structured datasets from various domains (similar to how "mouse" and "bug" gained computing context). The repository emphasizes automation-friendly formats with git hash-based versioning for production stability, supports multiple languages and UTF-8 encoding, and follows kebab-case naming conventions. It solves the recurring problem of name generation in CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, microservices deployment, and release management by offering categorized, single-word name lists that can be programmatically consumed for consistent, contextually-appropriate software nomenclature.
