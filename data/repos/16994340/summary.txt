wal2json is a PostgreSQL logical decoding output plugin written in C that enables Change Data Capture (CDC) by converting database transaction logs into JSON format. The plugin integrates with PostgreSQL's logical replication infrastructure to capture INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and outputs structured JSON objects representing data changes. It supports two output formats: transaction-level JSON objects containing all tuple changes, or individual JSON objects per tuple change. Target users include database administrators, data engineers, and backend developers implementing real-time data synchronization, event streaming, or database replication workflows. The plugin requires PostgreSQL 9.4+ with logical replication enabled and provides extensive configuration options for including metadata like transaction IDs, timestamps, schema information, and data types in the JSON output for downstream processing systems.
