`wal2json` is a PostgreSQL output plugin designed for logical decoding, enabling change data capture (CDC) by extracting JSON-formatted changes from write-ahead logs (WAL). It provides two JSON output formats, allowing for per-transaction or per-tuple change representation, and supports configurable options for including schema, data type, and transaction metadata. Built in C and compatible with PostgreSQL 9.4+, the plugin can be installed via package managers or built from source. Users can consume the extracted changes via logical replication slots or SQL functions, facilitating data replication and integration tasks.
