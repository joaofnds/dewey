`rate.sx` is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) application providing real-time and historical cryptocurrency exchange rates. It enables users to query current exchange rates, convert currencies, and visualize historical data through a terminal interface using `curl`. Functionality includes currency conversion, historical rate display with date range specification, and the ability to show data for various currencies and cryptocurrencies. This standalone application leverages the `curl` command to expose its functionality and targets users interested in accessing cryptocurrency exchange rates directly from the command line.
