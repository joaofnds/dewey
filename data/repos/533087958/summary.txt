`d2` is a standalone CLI and Go library providing a modern diagram scripting language that transforms text descriptions into diagrams. It facilitates the creation of various diagram types, including software architecture visualizations, via a custom syntax, with support for SVG, PNG, and PDF exports. The project leverages JavaScript for the core language implementation, incorporates language tooling features such as parsing, autoformatting, and syntax highlighting, and offers extensible capabilities through plugin integrations with layout engines like Dagre and ELK. The target audience is primarily developers seeking a text-based approach for diagramming and documentation within software development workflows.
