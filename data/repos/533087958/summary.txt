D2 is a domain-specific language (DSL) and CLI tool for programmatic diagram generation, targeting software developers and technical writers who need to create architectural diagrams, system documentation, and technical visualizations through code. Built primarily in Go with JavaScript bindings, it implements a text-to-diagram compiler that parses declarative syntax and renders output to SVG, PNG, and PDF formats using multiple layout engines including ELK and Dagre. The tool addresses the DevOps and software architecture documentation domain by enabling version-controlled, reproducible diagram creation that integrates into CI/CD pipelines and documentation workflows. It serves as an alternative to visual diagramming tools like Visio or Lucidchart, allowing developers to maintain diagrams as code alongside their software projects, supporting themes, custom styling, and programmatic generation of network diagrams, flowcharts, and system architecture visualizations.
