elasticsearch-rails is a Ruby gem collection that provides deep integration between Elasticsearch search engine and Ruby on Rails web applications. It targets web developers building Rails applications requiring full-text search, data indexing, and complex querying capabilities. The repository consists of three core gems: elasticsearch-model for ActiveRecord/Mongoid integration, elasticsearch-persistence for repository-pattern object persistence, and elasticsearch-rails for Rails-specific features. It solves the problem of efficiently searching and indexing application data by providing ActiveModel callbacks, automatic synchronization, pagination support (Kaminari/WillPaginate), Rake import tasks, and Rails instrumentation integration. The library enables developers to seamlessly add enterprise-grade search functionality to Rails applications while maintaining familiar ActiveRecord patterns and conventions.
