**Dash to Dock** is a GNOME Shell extension that transforms the default dash from the Activities overview into a persistent desktop dock for Linux systems. Written in JavaScript and targeting the GNOME desktop environment, it provides macOS-style dock functionality by moving application launchers outside the overview mode, enabling direct access to applications, window switching, and workspace navigation without interrupting desktop workflow. The extension integrates with GNOME's compositor architecture and requires SASS compilation for stylesheets, supporting dart-sass, sassc, and ruby-sass implementations. It addresses the productivity limitations of GNOME's default application launching mechanism by providing always-visible application shortcuts and window management controls, primarily serving Linux desktop users who prefer dock-based interfaces over the standard GNOME workflow paradigm.
