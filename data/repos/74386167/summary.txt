Psalm is a sophisticated static analysis tool specifically designed for PHP applications, targeting web developers and PHP engineers who need to identify code errors, type inconsistencies, and security vulnerabilities before runtime. Built in PHP itself, it employs advanced type inference algorithms and taint analysis to perform deep code inspection across PHP codebases. The tool addresses critical challenges in PHP development including dynamic typing issues, potential security exploits, and logic errors that traditional testing might miss. Psalm integrates into existing PHP development workflows, providing configurable analysis levels and comprehensive error reporting to help developers maintain code quality, enforce type safety, and prevent security breaches in web applications and PHP-based systems.
