Arrow is a Python datetime manipulation library that provides a unified, timezone-aware API for handling dates, times, and timestamps across Python applications. Targeting Python developers working in web development, data processing, and general software engineering, it serves as a drop-in replacement for Python's built-in datetime module while addressing its usability limitations. The library consolidates functionality scattered across multiple standard library modules (datetime, time, calendar, dateutil, pytz) into a single interface, offering features like automatic ISO 8601 parsing, timezone conversion, date arithmetic via shift operations, humanization with locale support, and PEP 484 type hints. Arrow solves the complexity of Python's datetime ecosystem by providing intuitive methods for common operations like parsing timestamps, converting between timezones, formatting output, and generating human-readable time descriptions, making it essential for developers who need reliable temporal data handling without verbose boilerplate code.
