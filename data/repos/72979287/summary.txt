Stacer is a cross-platform desktop application built with C++ and Qt 5.x that provides comprehensive Linux system optimization and monitoring capabilities. Targeting system administrators and Linux power users, it offers a graphical interface for cleaning system caches, managing startup applications, monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, disk usage), and performing routine maintenance tasks. The application integrates with systemd services and uses system calls to interact with Linux kernel subsystems for resource monitoring and cleanup operations. Built using CMake, it addresses the need for a centralized GUI tool to replace command-line system maintenance workflows on Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch Linux distributions. The project serves the Linux desktop administration domain by consolidating multiple system optimization tasks into a single native application.
