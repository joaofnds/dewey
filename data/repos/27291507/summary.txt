asdf is a unified command-line version manager that consolidates multiple language-specific version management tools (like nvm, rbenv, pyenv) into a single extensible platform. Built with Go and shell scripting, it targets software developers working across polyglot environments who need to manage different runtime versions of languages like Ruby, Node.js, Python, Elixir, and Erlang on a per-project basis. The tool provides cross-shell compatibility (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Elvish, PowerShell) and uses a plugin architecture to support additional languages through community-maintained extensions. It solves the complexity of installing and learning multiple version managers by offering consistent commands, automatic version switching via `.tool-versions` configuration files, and backward compatibility with existing version files like `.nvmrc` and `.ruby-version`, streamlining development workflow management for full-stack and polyglot developers.
