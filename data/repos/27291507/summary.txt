`asdf` is a CLI-based version manager designed to manage multiple language runtime versions (Ruby, Node.js, Elixir, Erlang, etc.) on a per-project basis. This tool provides a unified interface, eliminating the need for separate version managers. Key features include project-specific runtime version switching via `.tool-versions` files, support for existing configuration files, and plugin extensibility to support a wide range of languages. The project is written in Go and provides shell completions for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and Elvish, making it a developer productivity tool.
