**Huh** is a Go library for building interactive terminal-based forms and command-line user interfaces, targeting developers working in CLI/terminal application development and DevOps tooling. Built on top of Charm Bracelet's Bubble Tea TUI framework, it provides field types including single/multi-line text input, select dropdowns, multi-select checkboxes, and confirmation prompts with built-in validation and accessibility support for screen readers. The library addresses the common need for structured user input collection in terminal applications, replacing basic stdin prompts with rich, navigable forms. It serves Go developers building CLI tools, system administration utilities, configuration wizards, and interactive terminal applications who need to gather complex user input beyond simple command-line arguments and flags.
