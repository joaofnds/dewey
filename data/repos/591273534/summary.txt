Carbonyl is a terminal-based web browser built on Chromium and written in Rust, targeting developers and system administrators who need full web browsing capabilities in headless or SSH environments. It renders complete web pages with JavaScript, WebGL, WebGPU, and multimedia support directly to terminal text output at 60 FPS, solving the problem of accessing modern web applications on servers without graphical interfaces or through remote connections. The project modifies Chromium's Blink rendering engine to natively output terminal-compatible graphics rather than downscaling framebuffers, providing significantly better performance than alternative solutions like Browsh. It serves the DevOps and systems administration domain where GUI-less web access is essential, supporting Docker deployment and cross-platform binaries while maintaining compatibility with modern web standards and APIs that text-only browsers like Lynx cannot handle.
