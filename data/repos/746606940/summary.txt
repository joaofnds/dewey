Mario Kart 3.js is a web-based 3D racing game implementation that recreates Mario Kart gameplay mechanics using JavaScript and WebGL technologies. Built for the web gaming domain, this browser-native racing simulator features physics-based vehicle controls, drift mechanics with turbo boosts, particle effects for smoke and flames using shader programming, 3D track rendering, item pickup systems, and spatial audio integration. The project targets web game developers and JavaScript enthusiasts interested in WebGL graphics programming, 3D physics simulation, and browser-based game development. Key technical components include real-time 3D rendering, collision detection, particle systems, input handling for multiple control schemes, and performance optimization for browser environments, demonstrating advanced client-side JavaScript capabilities for interactive entertainment applications.
