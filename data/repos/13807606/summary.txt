`fzf` is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder written in Go, designed to provide an interactive filtering tool for various input sources. It enables users to quickly select items from lists, including files, command history, and processes, using a fuzzy matching algorithm that allows for pattern matching with omitted characters. The project features shell integrations for Bash, Zsh, Fish, Vim, and Neovim, offering keybindings for common tasks like file/directory selection and command history recall, and also includes advanced capabilities such as customizable display modes, search syntax, and support for custom fuzzy completion. This standalone CLI application targets developers and system administrators, improving command-line productivity through interactive and customizable item selection.
