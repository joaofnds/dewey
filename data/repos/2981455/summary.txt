The `gemoji` Ruby gem provides a comprehensive library for handling emoji character information and Unicode mapping in web applications. It serves web developers working with Ruby on Rails and other Ruby frameworks who need to integrate emoji functionality into their applications. The library enables bidirectional conversion between emoji aliases (like `:cat:`) and Unicode characters, supports custom emoji creation with configurable image paths, and provides HTML rendering helpers for displaying emoji as images. It addresses the common web development challenge of processing user-generated content containing emoji shortcodes, offering programmatic access to emoji metadata including names, aliases, Unicode values, and associated image filenames for asset management in web interfaces.
