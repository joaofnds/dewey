`gemoji` is a Ruby library providing character information and utilities for working with native emojis. It enables the translation between emoji names and their corresponding Unicode characters, offering functionalities like finding emojis by alias or Unicode, and custom emoji creation. The library is designed to be integrated into Ruby on Rails applications, as demonstrated by an example Rails helper for emojifying content, and is suitable for displaying and manipulating emoji data within web applications. It functions as a RubyGem, a reusable package, and leverages the Ruby language and utilizes image assets for rendering emojis.
