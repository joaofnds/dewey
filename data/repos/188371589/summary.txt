**isogrid** is a Java-based Processing library designed for generating isometric line plots from procedural geometry systems. Built on the Processing framework for creative coding and computational design, it transforms generative geometric data into isometric visualizations through specialized rendering algorithms. The library targets creative technologists, generative artists, and computational designers working in procedural art, architectural visualization, and geometric modeling domains. It addresses the specific challenge of converting 3D geometric systems into aesthetically coherent isometric line drawings, providing tools for grid-based isometric projection and line-based rendering. The system serves users who need to visualize complex generative geometry patterns in an isometric perspective, particularly for artistic applications, design prototyping, or educational demonstrations of geometric algorithms within the Processing creative coding environment.
