`isogrid` is a Java library and associated examples for generating isometric line plots. It leverages Processing, a visual programming language and environment. The project facilitates the creation of visualizations within a generative geometry system, enabling users to visualize geometric data in an isometric projection. This library likely targets users in design, architecture, or related fields requiring isometric representations of geometric forms.
