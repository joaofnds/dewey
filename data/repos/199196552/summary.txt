Artichoke is a Ruby programming language implementation written in Rust, targeting language implementation and runtime development domains. It provides an MRI-compatible Ruby interpreter and REPL (`airb`) with WebAssembly compilation support, enabling Ruby execution in browsers and untrusted environments. The project leverages Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics to build a Ruby runtime that supports both traditional Ruby execution and novel deployment scenarios like single-binary distribution and embedded systems. Key technologies include Rust for the core runtime, WebAssembly for browser compatibility, and Docker for containerized deployment. The system targets Ruby developers, language implementers, and organizations requiring secure Ruby execution in constrained environments, addressing limitations in traditional Ruby deployments regarding security, portability, and embedding capabilities.
