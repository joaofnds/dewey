Artichoke is a Ruby implementation built in Rust, aiming for MRI compatibility. It functions as a Ruby runtime environment, offering both an interactive REPL (`airb`) and a command-line `artichoke` executable for executing Ruby code, including support for file loading and inline script execution.  Key features include a WebAssembly build target and the ability to package Ruby applications as single binaries. The project utilizes Rust for its implementation and targets a developer audience interested in experimenting with Ruby runtimes, language design, and exploring alternative compilation and memory management strategies within the context of the Ruby language.
