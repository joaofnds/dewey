Kuby-core is a Ruby-based deployment automation framework that simplifies Kubernetes and Docker orchestration for Rails web applications. It provides convention-over-configuration tooling that abstracts complex DevOps workflows, automatically generating Docker containers, Kubernetes manifests, and infrastructure configurations. The framework handles database provisioning based on database.yml configurations, automatic TLS certificate management via LetsEncrypt, static asset serving, and includes a plugin system for extending functionality with tools like Sidekiq. Targeting Rails developers without extensive DevOps expertise, Kuby-core bridges the gap between local development and production Kubernetes deployments by codifying deployment best practices into reusable, configurable components that reduce the technical overhead of container orchestration and cloud infrastructure management.
