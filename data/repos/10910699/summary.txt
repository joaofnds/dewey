This repository implements an interactive web-based tutorial for learning Datalog, a declarative logic programming language commonly used in database systems and knowledge representation. Built with Clojure and deployed as a standalone JAR application, it provides hands-on exercises and examples to teach Datalog query syntax, rules, and reasoning capabilities. The application targets software developers, database engineers, and computer science students who need to understand declarative query languages and logic programming paradigms. It addresses the learning curve associated with Datalog's unique approach to data querying and rule-based inference, which differs significantly from SQL and other imperative programming approaches. The tutorial serves the broader data management and knowledge systems domain where Datalog is used for complex reasoning tasks.
