StatsD is a network daemon built on Node.js that serves as a metrics aggregation service for DevOps and application monitoring workflows. It listens for statistical data (counters, timers, gauges) sent via UDP or TCP protocols using a simple line protocol format, then aggregates these metrics over configurable flush intervals before forwarding them to pluggable backend services like Graphite. The daemon implements a bucket-based organization system for metrics and supports multiple server interfaces and backend integrations. Primarily used by system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers for real-time application performance monitoring and infrastructure observability, StatsD solves the problem of efficiently collecting, buffering, and routing high-frequency metrics data from distributed applications to time-series databases and monitoring systems.
