`statsd/statsd` is a standalone application daemon written in JavaScript, designed for aggregating and transmitting metrics data. It listens for statistical data, such as counters and timers, sent over UDP or TCP, and aggregates them before sending them to backend services like Graphite. Key features include customizable metric buckets, configurable flush intervals for aggregation, and support for various metric types. Built on Node.js, the project facilitates monitoring and performance analysis for applications and systems, targeting system administrators and developers needing to track metrics.
