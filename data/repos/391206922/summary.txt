nvim-notify is a Lua-based notification manager plugin for NeoVim that replaces the default vim.notify function with an animated, customizable notification system. Targeting NeoVim users and plugin developers in the text editor/IDE domain, it provides floating window notifications with configurable render styles (default, minimal, compact), animation stages (fade, slide, static), and highlight groups for different log levels (error, warn, info, debug, trace). The plugin integrates with telescope.nvim for notification history search, supports treesitter syntax highlighting within notifications, offers asynchronous notification handling via plenary.async, and includes features like notification updating, history management, and custom styling through Lua configuration. It solves the problem of poor visual feedback in terminal-based development environments by providing modern, non-intrusive notifications for NeoVim users and plugin ecosystem developers.
