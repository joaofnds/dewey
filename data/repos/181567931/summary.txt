`Socializer` is a demonstration social media web application built with Elixir and Phoenix, showcasing a GraphQL API backend and a React/Apollo frontend with server-side rendering. The application provides core social media functionality, including user interaction (e.g., messaging). The architecture employs an Elixir/Phoenix backend exposing a GraphQL endpoint, which is consumed by a React client bootstrapped with create-react-app, utilizing React Router and Apollo for data fetching.  This project serves as an example application and learning resource demonstrating the integration of these technologies, targeting developers interested in Elixir, Phoenix, GraphQL, and React.
