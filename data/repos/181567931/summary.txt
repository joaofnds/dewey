Socializer is a demonstration social media web application showcasing modern full-stack development patterns using Elixir/Phoenix backend with GraphQL API and React frontend with Apollo client integration. Built for the web development domain, it implements a complete social networking architecture including user messaging, authentication, and real-time features through Phoenix's WebSocket capabilities. The backend leverages Elixir's OTP model with Phoenix framework and Absinthe for GraphQL schema definition, while the frontend uses Create React App with server-side rendering, React Router for navigation, and Apollo for GraphQL state management. This educational codebase targets full-stack developers learning functional programming approaches to web development, particularly those exploring GraphQL-first architectures and Elixir's actor model for building concurrent, fault-tolerant web applications with modern JavaScript frontend integration.
