`pzmq` is a Common Lisp library providing bindings for ZeroMQ 4.0+, facilitating inter-process communication and networking. It exposes a Common Lisp API for ZeroMQ's messaging capabilities, including message sending and receiving, with interrupt handling for blocking calls and context/socket management enhancements through `WITH-CONTEXT` and `WITH-SOCKET` macros. This library, providing features like context and socket option configuration, is a developer productivity tool and is intended for use in Common Lisp projects requiring robust message-oriented middleware.
