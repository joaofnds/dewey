PZMQ is a Common Lisp binding library for ZeroMQ 4.0+, providing Lisp developers with access to ZeroMQ's high-performance asynchronous messaging capabilities. Targeting distributed systems and network programming domains, it enables Common Lisp applications to implement message queuing patterns like publish-subscribe, request-reply, and push-pull architectures. The library features automatic interrupt handling for blocking calls, garbage collection restart mechanisms, and convenient macro abstractions (WITH-CONTEXT, WITH-SOCKET) that simplify ZeroMQ socket management and context creation. It solves the integration challenge between Common Lisp applications and ZeroMQ's messaging infrastructure, allowing Lisp developers to build scalable, distributed systems without dropping to lower-level language bindings for network communication and message passing functionality.
