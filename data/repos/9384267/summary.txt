Electron is a cross-platform desktop application framework that enables web developers to build native desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Built on Node.js and Chromium, it combines a web runtime with native operating system APIs, allowing developers to leverage existing web development skills for desktop software creation. The framework targets the desktop application development domain, primarily serving frontend and full-stack developers who want to deploy web technologies across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Electron solves the cross-platform desktop development challenge by providing a unified runtime environment that wraps web applications in native containers, eliminating the need for platform-specific development languages like C++ or Swift while maintaining access to system-level functionality through Node.js APIs.
