Flutter is Google's open-source UI framework for cross-platform application development, enabling developers to build native mobile, web, and desktop applications from a single Dart codebase. The framework leverages hardware-accelerated rendering engines (Skia and Impeller) to deliver high-performance graphics and animations across iOS, Android, web browsers, Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Built on the Dart programming language with compilation to ARM machine code, JavaScript, and WebAssembly, Flutter provides a widget-based architecture supporting both Material Design and Cupertino design systems. The framework addresses the challenge of maintaining separate codebases for multiple platforms while offering features like stateful hot reload for rapid development cycles, targeting mobile and multi-platform application developers seeking unified development workflows.
