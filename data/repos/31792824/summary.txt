Flutter is Google's SDK and a cross-platform framework enabling the rapid development of visually appealing, high-performance applications for mobile (iOS, Android), web, and desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux). Built with Dart, it leverages hardware-accelerated 2D graphics through Skia and Impeller for efficient rendering and includes a rich set of customizable widgets based on Material and Cupertino design systems. This framework supports stateful hot reload for efficient development and provides extensive platform integration via FFI and platform channels, and serves as a foundation for building a variety of application types, including stand-alone applications and potentially web applications, targeting primarily mobile and web developers.
