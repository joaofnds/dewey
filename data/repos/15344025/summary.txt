SLIME (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode) is an Emacs extension that provides an integrated development environment for Common Lisp programming. It bridges Emacs text editing capabilities with live Common Lisp REPL interaction, enabling interactive programming workflows including real-time code compilation, debugging, documentation lookup, and process introspection. Built primarily in Common Lisp with Emacs Lisp integration, SLIME targets the functional programming and symbolic computation domain where Common Lisp is prevalent, such as AI research, academic computing, and specialized software development. The system solves the problem of disconnected edit-compile-test cycles by maintaining persistent connections between the editor and running Lisp images, allowing developers to evaluate code incrementally and inspect program state dynamically. It serves Common Lisp developers, researchers, and students who require sophisticated interactive development tools beyond basic text editing and batch compilation workflows.
