SLIME is an Emacs extension that provides an interactive programming environment for Common Lisp. It extends Emacs's functionality with a `slime-mode` minor mode, enabling features like compilation, debugging, documentation lookup, and interaction with a running Common Lisp process. Built in Common Lisp, it integrates with Emacs for an enhanced Lisp development workflow. This project is a plugin/extension designed to improve developer productivity for Common Lisp programmers.
