The sb2nov/mac-setup repository is a comprehensive GitBook-based documentation guide for configuring macOS development environments from scratch. It provides step-by-step installation instructions for essential programming languages (Node.js/JavaScript, Python, C++, Ruby) and development tools commonly required across web development, backend engineering, and general software development workflows. The guide targets software developers, DevOps engineers, and programmers who need to establish consistent development toolchains on new macOS systems or perform fresh installations. Built using GitBook and Shell scripts, it addresses the common problem of environment setup complexity by providing standardized procedures for installing language runtimes, package managers, command-line utilities, and daily-use development applications, serving as a reference manual for macOS-based development environment bootstrapping.
