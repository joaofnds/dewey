Brakeman is a static analysis security scanner specifically designed for Ruby on Rails web applications. Built in Ruby, it performs automated source code analysis to identify security vulnerabilities without executing the application code. The tool targets web developers and security engineers working with Rails applications from versions 2.3.x to 8.x, detecting common security flaws like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, and insecure configurations. Brakeman integrates into development workflows through RubyGems, Bundler, or Docker, supporting multiple output formats including JSON, HTML, and CI/CD-friendly formats like JUnit. It assigns confidence levels to findings and provides comparison capabilities for tracking security posture changes across application versions, making it essential for Rails security auditing and DevSecOps pipelines.
