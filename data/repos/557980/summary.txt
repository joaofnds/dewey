Socket.IO is a real-time bidirectional communication framework built on Node.js and TypeScript that enables WebSocket-based connections between web clients and servers. Targeting web developers building interactive applications, it provides event-driven messaging, automatic fallback to HTTP long-polling when WebSockets are unavailable, and built-in room/namespace management for organizing connections. The framework abstracts WebSocket complexity while adding reliability features like automatic reconnection, binary support, and multiplexing. It solves the challenge of implementing real-time features such as chat applications, live notifications, collaborative editing, and gaming by providing a robust abstraction layer over raw WebSocket protocols, making real-time web development accessible to JavaScript/Node.js developers without requiring deep knowledge of WebSocket internals.
