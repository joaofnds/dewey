Karate is a comprehensive test automation framework built in Java that unifies API testing, mock services, performance testing, and UI automation into a single BDD-style testing solution. Designed for quality assurance engineers and developers in web development and microservices environments, it provides a language-neutral, Gherkin-based syntax for testing HTTP APIs, JSON/XML services, GraphQL endpoints, and web interfaces without requiring traditional step definitions or glue code. The framework integrates with standard Java tooling (Maven, Gradle, JUnit 5), supports parallel test execution, and includes built-in assertions, HTML reporting, and contract testing capabilities. Karate addresses the complexity of maintaining separate tools for different testing types by offering a unified DSL that enables both technical and non-technical team members to write and maintain automated tests for modern web applications and API-driven architectures.
