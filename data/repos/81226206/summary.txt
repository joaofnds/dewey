Karate is a Java-based test automation framework designed to simplify API testing, performance testing, UI automation, and API mocking into a single, unified tool. It leverages a language-neutral, BDD-style syntax based on Gherkin, reducing the need for extensive "glue code" and enabling both technical and non-technical users to write and maintain tests. Key features include built-in assertions, HTML reports, parallel execution, and support for JSON, XML, and GraphQL, along with seamless integration into CI/CD pipelines. This is a testing framework, suitable for use with Java projects.
