The miekg/dns repository is a comprehensive DNS (Domain Name System) library written in Go that provides both client and server-side DNS programming capabilities for network infrastructure and DevOps applications. It implements the complete DNS protocol stack including DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions), DNS over TLS (DoT), EDNS0, TSIG authentication, zone transfers (AXFR/IXFR), and supports all standard DNS resource record types. The library follows RFC compliance across 50+ DNS-related specifications and is designed for building DNS servers, resolvers, monitoring tools, and network utilities. It targets Go developers, network engineers, and system administrators working on DNS infrastructure, load balancers, service discovery systems, and network security tools, with notable adoption by projects like CoreDNS, Consul, and various DNS monitoring services.
