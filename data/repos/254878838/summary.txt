indent-blankline.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides visual indentation guides for code editing. It leverages Neovim's virtual text API to render indentation markers without using concealment, targeting software developers working in any programming language within the Neovim text editor ecosystem. The plugin integrates with Tree-sitter for scope-aware highlighting, supports customizable color schemes including rainbow indentation, and offers features like mixed indentation detection and background highlighting. It addresses the common developer need for better visual code structure comprehension by making indentation levels clearly visible, particularly beneficial for Python, YAML, or other indentation-sensitive languages. The plugin is designed for developers who use Neovim as their primary code editor and want enhanced visual feedback for code structure and nesting levels.
