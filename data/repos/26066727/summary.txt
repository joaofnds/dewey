Mermaid is a JavaScript/TypeScript-based diagramming library that converts Markdown-inspired text syntax into interactive diagrams for technical documentation. Built primarily for web development and DevOps workflows, it generates flowcharts, sequence diagrams, UML diagrams, and mindmaps directly from code-like text definitions. The tool addresses documentation maintenance challenges in software development by enabling diagrams-as-code, allowing developers to version control and programmatically generate visual documentation alongside their codebase. It integrates with major platforms including GitHub, supports browser rendering, and provides a live editor for real-time diagram creation. Target users include software developers, technical writers, and DevOps engineers who need to maintain up-to-date visual documentation without manual diagram editing tools, solving the common problem of outdated technical diagrams in rapidly evolving codebases.
