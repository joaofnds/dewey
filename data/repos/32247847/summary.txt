RxJS is a TypeScript library providing reactive programming capabilities for JavaScript. It offers a production-ready implementation of Reactive Extensions, enabling developers to build applications that handle asynchronous data streams and events. Key functionalities include observable sequences, operators for data transformation and composition, and support for handling complex event flows. This monorepo structure houses the core RxJS package along with related applications, notably the documentation site, and is primarily intended for JavaScript developers seeking to implement reactive programming patterns in their projects.
