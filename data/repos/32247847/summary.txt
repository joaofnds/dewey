RxJS is a reactive programming library for JavaScript that implements the Observer pattern and functional programming paradigms to handle asynchronous data streams and events. Built with TypeScript, it provides a comprehensive API of operators for composing, transforming, and managing observable sequences in web development environments. The library addresses complex asynchronous programming challenges including event handling, HTTP requests, real-time data processing, and state management in modern JavaScript applications. Targeting front-end and Node.js developers, RxJS serves as the foundation for reactive frameworks like Angular and is widely adopted for building responsive user interfaces, managing complex async workflows, and handling time-based operations. The monorepo structure supports multiple packages with improved performance, modularity, and debugging capabilities over previous versions.
