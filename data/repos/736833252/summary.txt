emacs-lsp-booster is a Rust-based performance optimization tool for Emacs Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementations, specifically targeting lsp-mode and eglot. It functions as a wrapper executable around LSP server programs, converting JSON messages to Emacs Lisp bytecode representation for ~4x faster parsing performance and implementing multi-threaded I/O buffering to prevent blocking between Emacs and language servers. The tool addresses critical performance bottlenecks in Emacs development environments including slow JSON parsing, buffer overflow blocking, and UI freezing during server communication. It targets software developers using Emacs as their primary IDE who require responsive code intelligence features like autocompletion, diagnostics, and refactoring across multiple programming languages without modifying Emacs source code.
