`emacs-lsp-booster` is a standalone command-line tool written in Rust designed to enhance the performance of Emacs's LSP clients, specifically `lsp-mode` and `eglot`. It functions as a wrapper executable around language server protocol (LSP) server programs, optimizing communication with Emacs by converting JSON messages from the server into elisp bytecode, which improves parsing speed.  The tool implements multi-threading to manage input/output operations, mitigating blocking issues. This developer productivity tool's architecture involves interacting with Emacs's `lsp-mode` or `eglot` configurations by advising relevant parsing and command execution functions and relies on the user setting up a Rust toolchain to build or install it from crates.io.
