Lang Jam is a recurring weekend coding competition, modeled after game jams, where participants collaboratively create programming languages based on a specific theme. The project's core functionality centers around providing a framework and guidelines for participants to design, implement, and submit their custom programming languages, which can be either interpreters or compilers. Participants submit their projects, including source code, build instructions, examples, and documentation, as pull requests to the repository. The competition fosters a developer community and encourages creativity, with projects judged on creativity, uniqueness, and fun.
