Lang Jam is a community-driven programming language development competition that organizes weekend hackathons where participants create new programming languages from scratch based on announced themes. The platform operates through GitHub repositories hosting individual jam events, with past themes including "first-class comments," "patterns," and "Beautiful Assembly." Participants can build interpreters or compilers using any programming language available in Debian/Ubuntu or Arch package repositories, with submissions requiring source code, build instructions, documentation, and working examples. The competition targets programming language enthusiasts, compiler developers, and experimental programmers interested in language design and implementation. Projects are evaluated by community voting based on creativity, uniqueness, and fun factor, fostering innovation in programming language research and development within time-constrained collaborative environments.
