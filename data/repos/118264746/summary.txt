Eclector is a portable Common Lisp reader implementation that serves as a highly customizable alternative to standard Common Lisp readers, targeting Lisp developers and language tooling creators. Built in Common Lisp, it provides advanced error recovery capabilities allowing continued parsing after syntax errors, custom parse result generation for static analysis tools, and concrete syntax tree (CST) production for source code transformation utilities. The library addresses limitations in traditional Lisp readers by enabling recovery from multiple parsing errors in a single pass, supporting extensible parsing protocols, and generating detailed parse trees with source location tracking. It's particularly valuable for IDE developers, code analysis tools, refactoring systems, and any application requiring robust Lisp code parsing with detailed error reporting and custom result formats beyond standard S-expressions.
