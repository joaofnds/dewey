CLIFlix is a TypeScript-based command-line interface tool that enables instant media streaming through torrent technology. Built for multimedia enthusiasts and developers, it leverages WebTorrent for peer-to-peer streaming and integrates with popular media players like VLC, IINA, and MPV. The application searches torrent providers (1337x, ThePirateBay, etc.), automatically downloads and streams content without waiting for complete downloads, and supports subtitle integration via OpenSubtitles API. It offers three usage modes: interactive wizard, automatic "feeling lucky" selection, and manual magnet link processing. The tool addresses the friction in torrent-based media consumption by providing seamless integration between torrent discovery, streaming protocols, and desktop media applications, targeting users who prefer command-line workflows for multimedia access.
