`cliflix` is a command-line interface (CLI) application written in TypeScript that streams torrented media content directly to a user-specified application. Its core functionality involves searching for torrents based on user input, utilizing WebTorrent for streaming, and supporting subtitles. The application features a wizard mode for guided usage, "I'm feeling lucky" functionality for automated selection, and manual torrent identifier input. Configuration is enabled via a `~/.cliflix.json` file, allowing customization of downloads, output applications, torrent providers, subtitle settings, and WebTorrent options.
