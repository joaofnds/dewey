This repository provides a Solarized color scheme adaptation specifically for IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains IDEs (PhpStorm, PyCharm). It implements the popular Solarized color palette created by Ethan Schoonover as syntax highlighting themes for over 30 programming languages and file types, including Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, XML, and various web frameworks. The project addresses the common developer need for consistent, eye-friendly syntax highlighting across development environments by providing carefully configured color mappings for language-specific tokens, keywords, and UI elements. Targeted at software developers and programmers using JetBrains development tools, it solves the problem of poor default syntax highlighting and provides a scientifically-designed color scheme that reduces eye strain during extended coding sessions while maintaining high readability and contrast.
