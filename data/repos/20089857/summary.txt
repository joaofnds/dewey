Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, column-oriented NoSQL database designed for structured data storage, modeled after Google's Bigtable and built on top of Apache Hadoop. It provides high-availability and scalability for storing and managing large datasets, offering features like versioning and efficient data access. Developed in Java, this standalone database system is intended for use in big data environments, acting as a core component for storing and querying data within Hadoop-based ecosystems.
