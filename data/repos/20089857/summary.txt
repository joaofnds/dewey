Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, column-oriented NoSQL database built on top of Apache Hadoop, designed to handle massive structured data storage and retrieval. Modeled after Google's Bigtable, it provides real-time read/write access to large datasets with automatic sharding, versioning, and fault tolerance. Primarily targeting big data and data engineering domains, HBase serves applications requiring low-latency access to petabyte-scale datasets, such as time-series data, IoT sensor data, and web analytics. Built in Java and leveraging the Hadoop ecosystem (HDFS, MapReduce), it addresses the need for scalable, consistent data storage where traditional RDBMS solutions cannot handle the volume and velocity requirements. The system is designed for data engineers, backend developers, and system architects building distributed data processing pipelines.
