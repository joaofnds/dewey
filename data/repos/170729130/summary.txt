Lemmy is a federated link aggregator and forum platform built in Rust that implements the ActivityPub protocol for decentralized social networking. It serves as a self-hostable alternative to Reddit, targeting system administrators and developers seeking to deploy distributed social media infrastructure outside centralized corporate control. The backend leverages Actix web framework, Diesel ORM for database operations, and PostgreSQL for data persistence, while supporting federation across multiple server instances through ActivityPub. The platform addresses the need for decentralized content aggregation and discussion forums within the fediverse ecosystem, allowing cross-server user interaction, community subscription, and content sharing. It's designed for DevOps professionals and open-source enthusiasts who want to operate independent social media nodes while maintaining interoperability with the broader federated network of ActivityPub-compatible services.
