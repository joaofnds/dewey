`Lemmy` is a self-hostable, decentralized link aggregator and forum designed as an alternative to platforms like Reddit, operating within the Fediverse. Built with Rust, it leverages Actix for its web server, Diesel for database interaction, and Inferno for its frontend. Key features include community-based content aggregation, user moderation tools, cross-posting support, a mobile-friendly interface with features like live-updating comment threads and user tagging, and built-in image uploading. This project is a standalone, web-based application targeting users and administrators seeking a privacy-focused and federated social platform.
