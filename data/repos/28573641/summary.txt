`awesome-cl` is a curated list, serving as a comprehensive directory of Common Lisp frameworks, libraries, and tools. Primarily a developer resource, it categorizes a wide array of Common Lisp software, spanning domains like artificial intelligence, web development, database interaction, and GUI creation. The project showcases key functionalities, including listings for build systems (ASDF), web servers (Hunchentoot, Clack), libraries for string manipulation (str), and data structures (FSet), along with guidance on using Quicklisp and other Lisp-related tools.
