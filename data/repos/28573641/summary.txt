This repository is a curated directory of Common Lisp libraries, frameworks, and tools organized by functional domain. It serves as a comprehensive resource catalog for Common Lisp developers across multiple technical domains including web development, AI/machine learning, database integration, GUI development, cryptography, and system programming. The collection encompasses libraries for HTTP servers (Hunchentoot, Clack), web frameworks, ORMs, JSON/YAML processing, FFI bindings, graphics programming, and language extensions. Libraries are categorized by quality indicators (‚≠ê for community standards, üëç for recommended alternatives) and availability through Quicklisp, the de facto Common Lisp package manager. The repository targets experienced Lisp developers and newcomers seeking production-ready libraries for building applications in domains ranging from web services to scientific computing, providing vetted alternatives to reduce library selection overhead in the Common Lisp ecosystem.
