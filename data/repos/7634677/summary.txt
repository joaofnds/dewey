OpenSSL is a comprehensive C-based cryptographic library and toolkit that provides industrial-strength implementations of TLS/SSL, DTLS, and QUIC protocols for secure network communications. Targeting system administrators, security engineers, and application developers across web development, networking, and cybersecurity domains, it delivers three core components: libssl for protocol implementations up to TLSv1.3 and QUIC v1, libcrypto as a standalone cryptographic library, and a command-line tool for certificate management, encryption/decryption, and protocol testing. The library solves fundamental security challenges in network communications by providing FIPS-validated cryptographic primitives, X.509 certificate handling, and S/MIME email security, serving as the de facto standard cryptographic foundation for countless applications, web servers, and secure communication systems worldwide.
