The OpenSSL project provides a robust, commercial-grade, open-source cryptographic library and command-line tool primarily focused on securing network communications. It implements TLS/SSL, DTLS, and QUIC protocols, offering a full-strength cryptographic library (`libcrypto`) for general-purpose use, alongside the command-line `openssl` utility for cryptographic tasks such as key generation, certificate management, and encryption/decryption. Written in C, this library is a core component for implementing secure communication in a variety of applications and systems, making it a critical library for security-focused software. This is a library and a command-line tool.
