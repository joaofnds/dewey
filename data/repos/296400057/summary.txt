Grok is a spaced repetition learning application built as an educational project that replicates core Anki functionality using a full-stack Clojure ecosystem. The system implements a flashcard-based learning platform with a comprehensive REST API for managing users, decks, and cards, featuring spaced repetition algorithms that track study progress and schedule review dates. The backend leverages Clojure with Datomic for persistent storage and Mount for state management, while the frontend uses ClojureScript with Re-Frame for state management and DataScript via Re-Posh for client-side data handling. The application targets Clojure developers learning full-stack web development, demonstrating production-ready patterns including authentication, CRUD operations, relational data modeling, and modern functional programming approaches for building educational technology platforms.
