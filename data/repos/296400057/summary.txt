This repository provides a learning tool for building a limited version of Anki, focusing on the creation of a flashcard application. It implements a data model for users, decks, and cards, incorporating RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, deck management, and card operations (CRUD). The project leverages Clojure, Datomic, ClojureScript, Re-Frame, and DataScript (via Re-Posh) for its implementation, employing the Mount library for managing runtime state and lifecycle. It appears to be an example/tutorial project aimed at teaching Clojure and associated technologies.
