Neosync is an open-source data security and ETL orchestration platform built in Go with a Next.js/React frontend, designed for DevOps and data engineering teams managing sensitive production data across development environments. The platform provides automated data anonymization, synthetic data generation, and database synchronization capabilities for PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, utilizing Benthos for data pipeline orchestration and Docker/Kubernetes for deployment. It addresses compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, FERPA) by enabling developers to safely test against production-like data through PII detection, data transformation, and subsetting capabilities. The system features referential integrity preservation, custom JavaScript transformers, and GitOps-based configuration management, targeting software engineering teams who need secure, realistic test data for local development, CI/CD pipelines, and staging environments while maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance.
