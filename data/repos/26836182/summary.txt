therecipe/qt is a comprehensive Qt binding library for Go that enables cross-platform GUI application development across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. The repository provides Go language bindings for the Qt framework, allowing developers to create native graphical applications that deploy to Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, WebAssembly, and embedded systems like Raspberry Pi. It implements both CGO-based and experimental CGO-less compilation approaches, with Docker-based deployment automation for most target platforms. The binding covers nearly all Qt classes and functions, supporting static and dynamic linking modes depending on the target platform. This toolkit primarily serves Go developers in the desktop application development domain who need to create cross-platform GUI applications without learning C++ or Qt's native development stack, while maintaining access to Qt's full widget toolkit and platform-specific optimizations.
