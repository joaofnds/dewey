Stellar Core is the reference implementation of a peer-to-peer node that maintains the Stellar blockchain network, a distributed ledger system for financial transactions and payments. Written in C++17, it implements a replicated state machine that processes cryptocurrency transactions and maintains consensus across network peers using the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a federated Byzantine agreement algorithm. The software targets blockchain developers, financial technology companies, and payment service providers building on the Stellar network for cross-border payments, asset tokenization, and decentralized finance applications. It runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows, serving as the core infrastructure component that validates transactions, maintains ledger state, and participates in the distributed consensus mechanism that secures the Stellar payment network.
