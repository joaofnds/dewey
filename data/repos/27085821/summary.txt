`stellar/stellar-core` is the reference implementation for the Stellar network's peer-to-peer agent, operating within the financial technology domain. Written in C++17, it functions as a replicated state machine that maintains a local cryptographic ledger and processes transactions based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a federated consensus algorithm. This standalone application, designed to run on Linux, OSX, and Windows, provides the core functionality for managing and validating transactions within the Stellar network, enabling equitable access to the global financial system. It is a critical component for the decentralized financial infrastructure of the Stellar platform.
