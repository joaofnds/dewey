Command-T is a high-performance fuzzy file finder plugin for Neovim and Vim editors, designed for software developers and technical professionals who require rapid file navigation in code projects. The plugin implements a hand-crafted matching algorithm in C with parallelized search capabilities, enabling fast fuzzy searching across files, buffers, tags, help documentation, and command history. It integrates with Watchman for file system monitoring and includes input debouncing optimizations to maintain responsiveness in large codebases. The plugin supports multiple file opening modes (current window, splits, tabs) and provides configurable ranking algorithms that prioritize matches based on path separators and character positioning. Written primarily in Lua with C extensions, Command-T targets development environments where efficient file navigation and minimal keystroke workflows are essential for productivity.
