`Muon` is a cross-platform desktop application framework that offers a lightweight alternative to Electron, written in Go. It leverages Ultralight, a GPU-based WebKit rewrite, for rendering HTML-based user interfaces, aiming for reduced CPU, memory, and disk usage compared to Electron. Key features include full JavaScript-to-Go interop, hot-reloading capabilities, and GPU-accelerated rendering. This project is a standalone application framework targeting developers seeking to build cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies, providing a smaller-footprint alternative to traditional Electron applications.
