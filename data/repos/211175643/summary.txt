Muon is a lightweight cross-platform desktop application framework that serves as a minimal alternative to Electron for web developers building native desktop apps. Written in Go with C bindings, it leverages Ultralight's GPU-accelerated WebKit engine instead of Chromium to render HTML/CSS/JavaScript interfaces while consuming significantly less memory and disk space. The framework provides bidirectional JavaScript-to-Go interop, allowing developers to expose Go functions to the web frontend and handle type conversion automatically. Targeting web developers who need to deploy web applications as desktop software, Muon addresses Electron's resource overhead problem by offering similar functionality with reduced CPU usage (0.0% vs 1.2%), memory footprint (26MB vs 201MB), and disk requirements (42MB vs 136MB) for typical applications.
