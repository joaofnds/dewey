Arc Theme is a comprehensive desktop theming system for Linux environments, specifically targeting GTK-based desktop environments including GNOME, Unity, Budgie, Pantheon, Xfce, and MATE. Built primarily with CSS and utilizing the GTK+ toolkit (versions 2 and 3), it provides three visual variants (Arc, Arc-Darker, Arc-Dark) featuring flat design principles with transparent UI elements. The theme supports GNOME Shell versions 3.14-3.24 and requires the Murrine rendering engine for proper functionality. Using autotools build system (autoconf/automake), it generates consistent visual styling across window managers (Metacity, XFWM), shell environments, and applications. The project addresses Linux desktop customization needs for system administrators, power users, and desktop environment enthusiasts seeking unified visual consistency across their GTK-based workflow tools and applications.
