The iTerm2-Color-Schemes repository is a comprehensive collection of over 400 terminal color schemes and themes primarily designed for iTerm/iTerm2 on macOS, with extensive cross-platform ports for numerous terminal emulators including Terminal, Konsole, PuTTY, Alacritty, Windows Terminal, and many others. Built using Shell scripting with Python tooling for color space conversion and automated generation, this project serves the developer tools and DevOps domain by providing consistent visual theming across different terminal environments. The repository includes automated conversion tools that transform .itermcolors files between P3 and sRGB color spaces, and generates platform-specific configuration files for various terminal applications. It primarily targets software developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who require standardized terminal aesthetics across heterogeneous computing environments, solving the problem of maintaining consistent visual workflows across different operating systems and terminal applications.
