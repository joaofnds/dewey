GopenPGP V3 is a high-level OpenPGP cryptographic library for Go developers, built on ProtonMail's fork of the golang crypto library. It provides a simplified API for implementing end-to-end encryption, digital signatures, and key management in Go applications. The library supports both password-based and public-key cryptography operations including encryption/decryption, key generation, detached signatures, and cleartext signing. It implements OpenPGP standards including RFC 4880 and the latest RFC 9580 with modern cryptographic primitives like Argon2 for key derivation and AEAD encryption modes. Primarily targeting secure communication applications, email encryption systems, and privacy-focused software developers, it offers Go Mobile compatibility for cross-platform deployment. The library abstracts complex OpenPGP operations into developer-friendly interfaces while maintaining cryptographic security standards.
