`gopenpgp` is a Go library providing a high-level interface for OpenPGP encryption, decryption, signing, and key management. Built upon a fork of the Go crypto library, it enables password-based and key-based encryption/decryption, with support for various OpenPGP standards and profiles, including RFC9580. The library features examples for common OpenPGP operations, including encrypted messages, signatures, and streaming encryption of large files, and supports Go Mobile compatibility. Primarily a library, it provides functionality for developers requiring secure communication and data protection within Go applications.
