HoneySQL is a Clojure/ClojureScript library that provides a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for programmatically generating SQL queries from Clojure data structures. Targeting backend web developers and database-driven applications, it transforms hash maps and vectors into parameterized SQL statements compatible with JDBC libraries like next.jdbc. The library solves the problem of dynamic SQL generation without string concatenation, enabling compile-time query construction, runtime query building, and SQL injection prevention through automatic parameterization. It supports multiple SQL dialects, namespace-qualified keywords for table-qualified columns, and offers formatting options including inline values and pretty-printing. HoneySQL serves Clojure developers building data-driven applications who need type-safe, composable SQL query generation while maintaining compatibility with the broader Clojure database ecosystem and supporting both server-side and ClojureScript environments.
