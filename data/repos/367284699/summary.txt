Lima is a tool for launching Linux virtual machines, primarily designed to facilitate containerized application development and deployment. It provides automatic file sharing and port forwarding, simplifying the use of container engines like containerd, Docker, and Kubernetes on macOS, Linux, and NetBSD hosts.  Built in Go, Lima enables users to run Linux commands and manage containerized applications directly from their host machine, supporting various container runtimes. This project functions as a standalone CLI application focused on enhancing developer productivity by providing a streamlined environment for containerized workloads.
