Lima is a CNCF sandbox project that provides Linux virtual machine management specifically designed for containerized development workflows on macOS and other non-Linux hosts. Built in Go and leveraging QEMU virtualization, Lima automatically handles file sharing and port forwarding between host and guest systems, eliminating the complexity of manual VM configuration. The project primarily targets DevOps engineers, container developers, and system administrators who need seamless access to Linux container runtimes (containerd, Docker, Podman) and Kubernetes clusters from macOS environments. Lima integrates with nerdctl, Docker CLI, and kubectl, serving as the underlying virtualization layer for popular tools like Rancher Desktop, Colima, and Finch, effectively solving the container development experience gap on macOS systems.
