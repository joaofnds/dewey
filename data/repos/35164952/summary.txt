Unison is a statically-typed functional programming language implemented in Haskell that introduces content-addressed code storage, where functions are identified by cryptographic hashes of their implementations rather than names. The language targets general-purpose software development and distributed systems programming, storing code as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in a database-backed codebase format. Key innovations include perfect incremental compilation with shared compilation caches, semantic version control that avoids merge conflicts from formatting differences, and instant non-breaking refactoring capabilities. The system includes a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation, a web-based codebase server, and integration with Unison Cloud for distributed computing. Primary users are functional programming developers and software engineers building scalable distributed systems who benefit from the elimination of traditional build processes and enhanced code management through content-addressable storage.
