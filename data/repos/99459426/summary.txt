org-ql is an Emacs Lisp package that provides advanced query capabilities for Org-mode documents, targeting productivity-focused Emacs users and knowledge workers who manage structured information in plain text. It implements two query syntaxes (Lisp s-expressions and search engine-like keywords) to search and filter Org files based on headings, content, timestamps, tags, and hierarchical relationships. The package extends Org-mode's native agenda functionality with interactive search commands, saved views, sparse tree generation, and Helm integration for completion-based navigation. It solves the limitation of Org-mode's basic search by enabling complex queries across large document collections, making it essential for users managing extensive note-taking systems, task management workflows, and knowledge bases within the Emacs ecosystem.
