`concurrent-ruby` is a Ruby library providing modern concurrency tools inspired by Erlang, Clojure, Scala, and Java, among others. It offers an unopinionated toolbox including agents, futures, promises, thread pools, and various thread-safe data structures (arrays, hashes, sets, etc.) designed for building concurrent Ruby applications.  The library emphasizes thread safety across different Ruby interpreters and leverages features like atomic variables, read-write locks, and synchronization primitives. It functions as a library and targets Ruby developers needing robust concurrency primitives for their applications.
