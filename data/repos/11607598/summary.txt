Concurrent Ruby is a comprehensive concurrency library for Ruby developers that provides thread-safe abstractions for parallel and asynchronous programming. The library implements modern concurrency patterns including agents, futures, promises, thread pools, actors, and supervisors, drawing inspiration from functional programming languages like Erlang, Clojure, and Scala. It addresses Ruby's traditional concurrency limitations by offering immutable data structures, thread-safe collections, and synchronization primitives that work consistently across MRI/CRuby, JRuby, and TruffleRuby interpreters. The gem is designed for Ruby application developers building concurrent systems, web applications, and background processing services who need reliable concurrency tools without external dependencies, emphasizing thread safety guarantees and idiomatic Ruby implementation while supporting both shared-memory and message-passing concurrency models.
