Fastify is a high-performance HTTP web framework for Node.js designed to minimize overhead while maximizing request throughput for web application development. Built with JavaScript and targeting backend developers, it provides an Express-like API with enhanced performance characteristics through optimized routing, JSON schema validation, and a plugin-based architecture. The framework addresses the core problem of server efficiency in web development by offering built-in logging, TypeScript support, async/await compatibility, and extensive middleware ecosystem while maintaining developer experience similar to Express.js. Fastify serves web developers building REST APIs, microservices, and full-stack applications who require both development velocity and production performance optimization.
