Svelte is a compile-time web framework that transforms declarative component code into optimized vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation. Unlike runtime frameworks like React or Vue, Svelte performs the heavy lifting during the build process, generating efficient imperative code that directly updates the DOM without a virtual DOM layer. The compiler processes single-file components containing HTML templates, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic, producing lightweight bundles with minimal runtime overhead. Targeting frontend web developers, Svelte addresses performance and bundle size concerns in modern web application development by eliminating the need for a framework runtime, resulting in faster initial loads and reduced JavaScript payload delivered to browsers.
