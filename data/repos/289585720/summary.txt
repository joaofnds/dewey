The jak-project is a reverse engineering initiative that decompiles and ports the PlayStation 2 games Jak and Daxter and Jak II to modern x86-64 platforms. The project reconstructs the original GOAL (Game Oriented Assembly Lisp) programming language used by Naughty Dog, implementing a custom compiler to translate decompiled game code for native PC execution. Built primarily in Common Lisp, it includes a decompiler for PS2 binaries, a GOAL-to-x86-64 compiler, asset extraction/repacking tools, and a game runtime supporting live code modification. Targeting game preservation enthusiasts and modding communities, it enables native performance gameplay without emulation while maintaining compatibility with the original game's architecture and supporting real-time code modifications for development and modding purposes.
