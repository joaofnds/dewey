`open-goal/jak-project` is a reverse-engineering and porting project focused on recreating the Jak & Daxter video game series for PC. The project's core functionality includes decompilation of the original game code written in the custom Lisp-based GOAL language, development of a x86-64 GOAL compiler, and asset extraction and repackaging tools. This allows users to build and run a "native application" port of the game. The project utilizes Common Lisp for the original game's logic and C++ for the runtime environment, with dependencies including CMake and clang/LLD for build processes, and targets x86-64 Linux and Windows platforms. The project is a standalone application, with the goal of creating a playable PC port from original PS2 code, and it caters to developers interested in reverse engineering and game modification, and possibly gamers.
