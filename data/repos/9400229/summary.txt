vim-tmux-navigator is a Vim Script plugin that enables seamless navigation between Vim window splits and tmux terminal panes using unified keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+h/j/k/l). Targeting software developers and system administrators who use terminal-based development workflows, it solves the friction of switching between different panes in split-screen tmux sessions containing Vim editors. The plugin integrates with both Vim/Neovim editors and tmux terminal multiplexer through coordinated configuration, detecting when Vim is active in a tmux pane and routing navigation commands appropriately. It supports modern plugin managers like Vundle, lazy.nvim, and TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager), requiring tmux v1.8+ and providing customizable key bindings for developers who prefer terminal-based development environments over GUI editors.
