`vim-tmux-navigator` is a Vim plugin that facilitates seamless navigation between Vim splits and Tmux panes. Utilizing Vim Script and Tmux configuration, it provides consistent hotkeys (e.g., Ctrl-H, Ctrl-J, Ctrl-K, Ctrl-L, and Ctrl-\) to move between Vim and Tmux environments without the need for a Tmux prefix. This plugin is configured via Vim plugins like Vundle or lazy.nvim and requires Tmux version 1.8 or higher. It's a developer productivity tool, primarily used by developers who use both Vim and Tmux.
