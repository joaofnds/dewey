`gopsutil` is a Go library providing cross-platform system and process monitoring capabilities, mirroring the functionality of Python's `psutil`.  It enables retrieval of system information, including CPU usage, memory statistics, disk I/O, network metrics, and process details, across multiple operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, macOS, OpenBSD, and Solaris.  The library is structured with a focus on platform compatibility and provides architecture-specific `Ex` structs for accessing platform-dependent features. As a library, it facilitates system-level monitoring and diagnostics, targeting Go developers needing to integrate system-level insights into their applications.
