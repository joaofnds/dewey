gopsutil is a cross-platform Go library that provides system and process monitoring capabilities, serving as a pure Go port of Python's psutil library. It enables developers to programmatically collect system information including CPU usage, memory statistics, disk I/O, network interfaces, and running processes across FreeBSD, Linux, Windows, macOS, OpenBSD, and Solaris platforms. Implemented without CGO dependencies by translating C system structures to native Go structs, it targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, and backend developers building monitoring tools, system dashboards, resource management applications, and infrastructure automation solutions. The library offers JSON serialization, configurable system path locations via environment variables or context, optional caching mechanisms, and platform-specific extended functionality through specialized Ex structs for accessing OS-unique metrics.
