`enigma` is a Rust-based virtual machine (VM) implementation targeting the Erlang programming language and its BEAM bytecode, aiming for correctness, completeness, and performance. It provides core VM functionalities, including support for Erlang's processes, message passing, lambdas, exceptions, and floating-point math, alongside features like maps, binaries, and partial implementations of built-in functions (BIFs) and opcodes. This standalone project strives for OTP 22+ compatibility and offers a foundation for exploring Erlang VM internals and potential enhancements to the BEAM.
