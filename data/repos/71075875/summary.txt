Kulfon is a JavaScript-based static site generator designed for web developers building content-driven websites. Built on Node.js, it combines multiple markup formats (Markdown and Org Mode) with Nunjucks templating to generate static HTML sites through a single command interface. The tool integrates Rollup for JavaScript bundling, Sass for CSS preprocessing, and supports hot reloading during development. Targeting web developers who need a Hugo-like workflow but prefer JavaScript ecosystem integration, Kulfon addresses the need for unified dependency management through npm/Yarn while producing optimized static websites. The generator emphasizes performance and HTTP/2 readiness, making it suitable for developers creating blogs, documentation sites, and content-heavy web projects who want JavaScript-native tooling rather than Go-based alternatives like Hugo.
