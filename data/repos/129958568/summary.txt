NodeTube is an open-source video streaming platform built with Node.js/Express that serves as a YouTube alternative for content creators and platform administrators. The application uses MongoDB for data persistence, Redis for caching, and FFmpeg for video processing and transcoding. It implements resumable file uploads via resumable.js, livestreaming capabilities through nginx-rtmp integration with HLS.js for playback, and includes built-in monetization via Stripe payments. The platform supports video, audio, and image uploads up to 500MB, features user authentication, moderation tools, and administrative interfaces. Target users include developers seeking to deploy decentralized media platforms, content creators wanting data ownership, and system administrators managing alternative social media infrastructure with cloud deployment options including Heroku integration.
