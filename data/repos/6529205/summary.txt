Pundit is a Ruby authorization library designed for web applications, particularly Rails applications, that implements access control through object-oriented policy classes. It provides a minimal, pure Ruby approach to authorization by leveraging policy objects that encapsulate permission logic for specific model resources. The library integrates with Rails controllers through mixins and follows naming conventions where policy classes (e.g., PostPolicy) correspond to model classes (e.g., Post) and implement query methods that match controller actions. Pundit addresses the need for scalable, maintainable authorization systems in Ruby web applications by replacing complex permission logic scattered throughout controllers with organized, testable policy classes. It targets Ruby on Rails developers who need to implement role-based or attribute-based access control without heavyweight authorization frameworks.
