Pundit is a Ruby library providing a straightforward and scalable authorization system for Ruby applications, built around object-oriented design principles. It enables developers to define authorization logic through plain Ruby policy classes, mapping permissions to controller actions and model objects. Key features include `authorize` and `policy_scope` helpers for integrating authorization checks into controllers and views, along with RSpec matchers for testing policy classes and a generator for quickly setting up policy structures. The library targets Ruby on Rails developers seeking a flexible and maintainable authorization solution, offering features like namespaced policies and strong parameter integration.
