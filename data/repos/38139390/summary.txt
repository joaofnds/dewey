Dockercraft is a Docker container management tool that provides a Minecraft-based interface for visualizing and controlling Docker containers. Built using Lua and the Cuberite Minecraft server, it translates Docker operations into interactive Minecraft gameplay where containers are represented as in-game objects that can be started, stopped, and removed using levers, buttons, and chat commands. The system integrates with the Docker Remote API through socket mounting and runs as a containerized Minecraft server on port 25565. Targeted at DevOps engineers and system administrators, it addresses Docker container management through gamification, offering an alternative visualization method for monitoring container states and executing basic Docker operations in a 3D environment without requiring Minecraft client modifications.
