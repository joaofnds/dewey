Dockercraft is a Minecraft server plugin written in Lua that visualizes and manages Docker containers within a Minecraft environment. The project utilizes a custom Minecraft server, Cuberite, written in C++, with the Lua plugin acting as an intermediary. A Go-based daemon, goproxy, facilitates communication with the Docker remote API, enabling container control operations like starting, stopping, and removing containers via in-game interactions and chat commands. This standalone application provides a unique, game-based interface for Docker container management and leverages the Minecraft platform for visualizing and interacting with containerized applications, targeting system administrators and Docker users.
