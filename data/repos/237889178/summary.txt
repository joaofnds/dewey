This repository contains a comprehensive Doom Emacs configuration implemented as a literate programming setup using Org-mode. The configuration targets developers and power users who require a highly customized text editor environment, particularly those working in software development, academic writing, and technical documentation. The core technical approach uses Org-mode's code tangling capabilities to generate traditional Emacs Lisp configuration files (init.el, config.el, packages.el) from a single documented config.org source file. Built on the Doom Emacs framework running on GNU Emacs 29.2, it employs literate configuration methodology where documentation and code coexist, enabling maintainable and well-documented editor customization. The setup includes automated publishing workflows, package management integration, and modular organization through Git submodules, addressing the common problem of managing complex editor configurations while maintaining readability and reproducibility for technical professionals who rely heavily on text-based workflows.
