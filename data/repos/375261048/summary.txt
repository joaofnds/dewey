This repository contains a collection of TypeScript-based Backstage plugins developed by Roadie for extending developer portal functionality. Built for the DevOps and platform engineering domain, these plugins integrate popular development tools including GitHub (pull requests, insights), AWS Lambda, Jira, Datadog, Travis CI, Argo CD, Buildkite, and Bugsnag into Backstage developer portals. The plugins follow Backstage's frontend/backend architecture pattern and include comprehensive testing with Cypress for E2E scenarios. Target users are platform engineers, DevOps teams, and developer experience engineers who need to consolidate multiple development tools and services into a unified developer portal interface, eliminating context switching between disparate systems while providing centralized visibility into code repositories, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, and project management tools.
