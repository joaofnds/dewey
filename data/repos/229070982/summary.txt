This Clojure library provides a data-driven Kubernetes API client for DevOps and platform engineering teams. Built by Nubank, it offers a programmatic interface to interact with Kubernetes clusters through native Clojure data structures, supporting multiple authentication methods including tokens, client certificates, and token functions. The library features dynamic OpenAPI specification discovery for automatic API introspection, operation exploration capabilities, and schema-validated request/response handling. It addresses the need for a discoverable, documentation-rich Kubernetes client in the Clojure ecosystem, similar to cognitect-labs/aws-api but for container orchestration. Target users include Clojure developers, SREs, and DevOps engineers who need to programmatically manage Kubernetes resources, perform cluster operations, and integrate Kubernetes management into larger Clojure-based infrastructure automation workflows.
