**quiver** is a web-based graphical editor specifically designed for creating commutative diagrams and pasting diagrams used in category theory and advanced mathematics. Built with JavaScript, it targets mathematicians, researchers, and academics who need to create publication-quality mathematical diagrams for papers, presentations, and educational materials. The application renders diagrams for screen viewing and exports them to LaTeX via tikz-cd, solving the time-consuming problem of manually coding complex mathematical diagrams in LaTeX. Key features include support for pullbacks, pushouts, adjunctions, higher cells, flexible grid-based object placement, customizable arrow styles, and color support. Users can create diagrams orders of magnitude faster than writing equivalent LaTeX code by hand, bridging the gap between intuitive graphical editing and professional mathematical typesetting requirements.
