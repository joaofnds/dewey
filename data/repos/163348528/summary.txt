`quiver` is a JavaScript-based, web-based standalone application providing a modern, graphical editor for creating and manipulating commutative and pasting diagrams. It enables users to visually construct complex diagrams, including pullbacks, pushouts, adjunctions, and higher cells, with a focus on high-quality LaTeX export via `tikz-cd`. Key features include a flexible grid, diverse arrow styles, color customization, keyboard shortcuts, and macro support for custom LaTeX definitions, facilitating rapid diagram creation compared to manual LaTeX coding. This project primarily targets researchers and academics in mathematics, category theory, and related fields needing to visually represent and share mathematical diagrams.
