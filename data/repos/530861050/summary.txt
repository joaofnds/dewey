This repository contains a VSCode extension that transforms TypeScript error messages into human-readable, syntax-highlighted displays for web developers. The extension addresses the core problem of TypeScript's increasingly cryptic error messages in complex type scenarios by parsing raw diagnostic output and rendering it with proper syntax highlighting, navigation buttons to type declarations, and links to error explanation resources like typescript.tv and ts-error-translator. Built in TypeScript, it supports modern web development frameworks including React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, and Deno across multiple file types (.ts, .tsx, .vue, .astro, .svelte). The extension creates a custom TextMate grammar superset and implements VSCode diagnostic message transformation to overcome limitations in VSCode's markdown rendering, specifically targeting frontend and full-stack TypeScript developers who work with complex type systems and need clearer error comprehension during development workflows.
