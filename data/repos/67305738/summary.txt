`syn` is a Rust library providing a parser for Rust source code, primarily designed for use within Rust procedural macros. It enables the transformation of token streams into a syntax tree, offering data structures like `syn::File`, `syn::Item`, and `syn::DeriveInput` to represent Rust code constructs. Key functionalities include parsing, span tracking for detailed error reporting, and feature flags for compile-time optimization. This library assists in building custom syntaxes and derive macros, as demonstrated in examples for derive macros and custom syntax parsing; it's a library intended for Rust developers creating macros and related tooling.
