Syn is a Rust parsing library that transforms Rust source code token streams into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), primarily designed for procedural macro development. It provides comprehensive data structures representing all valid Rust syntax elements including `File`, `Item`, `Expr`, `Type`, and `DeriveInput` nodes, enabling developers to build custom derive macros, attribute macros, and function-like macros. The library offers granular parsing functions with `ParseStream` interfaces, maintains source location spans for error reporting, and features aggressive feature-gating for optimized compile times. Targeting Rust developers working in systems programming, compiler tooling, and code generation domains, Syn solves the complex problem of parsing Rust's sophisticated syntax reliably, serving as foundational infrastructure for the Rust procedural macro ecosystem alongside complementary crates like `quote` and `proc-macro2`.
