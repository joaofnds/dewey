**straight.el** is a purely functional package manager for Emacs that provides an alternative to the built-in `package.el` system. Built entirely in Emacs Lisp, it targets Emacs power users and developers who need reproducible, version-controlled package management. The system clones packages directly from Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) into local directories, enabling users to edit packages locally, pin specific commits, and maintain configuration reproducibility through lockfiles. It integrates with `use-package` for declarative configuration and supports custom recipes for packages not available in standard repositories like MELPA or GNU ELPA. The tool addresses limitations of traditional Emacs package managers by providing deterministic builds, direct repository access, and fine-grained control over package sources and versions for professional Emacs development workflows.
