`straight.el` is an Emacs Lisp package manager designed for Emacs hackers, offering a purely functional approach to managing Emacs packages. It enables installing packages from MELPA, GNU ELPA, and Emacsmirror, supporting version control via Git to clone and manage package repositories. Key functionalities include automatic dependency resolution, local package modification with easy upstream contribution, and reproducible Emacs configuration through version lockfiles. This developer productivity tool is primarily implemented in Emacs Lisp and integrates with `use-package` to streamline package installation and configuration.
