HTTP.cat is a developer-focused web application that provides an API for serving HTTP status code representations through cat-themed images. Built with Next.js 13 and TypeScript, it serves as a visual reference tool for web developers to understand and communicate HTTP status codes in a memorable format. The project leverages static site generation with server-side routing handled by Nginx configuration, eliminating the need for runtime server code. It addresses the common developer need for intuitive HTTP status code documentation and debugging aids, making error codes more approachable through visual mnemonics. The API serves both programmatic access and human-readable status code explanations, targeting web developers, API designers, and educational use cases in the web development domain.
