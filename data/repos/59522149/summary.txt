Terragrunt is a Go-based CLI orchestration tool that extends Terraform and OpenTofu capabilities for managing Infrastructure as Code at scale. Targeting the DevOps and cloud infrastructure domain, it addresses the complexity of managing multiple Terraform configurations across environments by providing features like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) configuration management, dependency orchestration, and remote state handling. The tool primarily serves DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers, and infrastructure teams working with AWS and other cloud providers who need to manage complex, multi-environment Terraform deployments. Terragrunt acts as a thin wrapper around Terraform/OpenTofu, solving configuration duplication and orchestration challenges in large-scale infrastructure automation workflows while maintaining compatibility with existing Terraform codebases.
