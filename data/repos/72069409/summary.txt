Voyager is a Laravel-based administrative panel package that provides a complete BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add, Delete) system for PHP web applications. Built with Vue.js frontend and Bootstrap UI framework, it serves as a ready-to-use admin interface for Laravel developers who need rapid backend administration capabilities without building custom admin panels from scratch. The package integrates directly into existing Laravel applications through Composer, offering database management, user authentication, content management, and CRUD operations through a web-based dashboard. Targeted at Laravel developers and web development teams, Voyager eliminates the repetitive task of creating administrative interfaces for web applications, though the project is now archived with maintainers recommending modern alternatives like FilamentPHP and Laravel Nova.
