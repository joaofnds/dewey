OpenHands is an AI-powered software development automation platform that enables autonomous coding agents to perform developer tasks including code modification, command execution, web browsing, and API interactions. Built in Python, it integrates with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, ChatGPT) and runs in Docker containers for sandboxed execution environments. The platform targets software developers and engineering teams by automating routine development workflows, code generation, debugging, and system administration tasks. It features both cloud-hosted and local deployment options with CLI and web interfaces, addressing the need for intelligent development assistance that can operate with human-level capability across the full software development lifecycle.
