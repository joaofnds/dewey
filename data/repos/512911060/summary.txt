Deco is a Git-based visual content management system specifically designed for the modern web development stack of Deno, HTMX, and Tailwind CSS. Built in TypeScript, it targets frontend developers working on performant web applications by automatically generating visual content editor interfaces from TypeScript component props definitions. The platform leverages server-side JSX rendering with Preact, client-side HTMX interactivity, and native Tailwind theme support while maintaining JavaScript-independence for optimal performance. Deco solves the integration complexity between UI components and data sources by using TypeScript types as a shared vocabulary, enabling automatic matching of component requirements with community-driven integrations for ecommerce platforms (Shopify, VTEX), search providers (Algolia, Typesense), and other third-party services, streamlining the development workflow from type definition to deployment.
