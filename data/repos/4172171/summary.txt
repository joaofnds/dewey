`ob-go` is an Emacs Lisp extension that provides Org-Babel integration for executing Go code blocks within Org-mode documents. Targeting developers who use Emacs for literate programming and documentation workflows, it enables inline Go code evaluation through the `go run` command with automatic main function wrapping and package declaration handling. The extension supports Go-specific header arguments including imports management, command-line arguments, compiler flags, and Babel variables, facilitating executable documentation and reproducible code examples. It serves the technical writing and documentation domain, particularly for Go developers creating tutorials, documentation, or conducting exploratory programming within Emacs' Org-mode ecosystem, solving the problem of seamlessly integrating runnable Go code snippets into structured documents without leaving the Emacs environment.
