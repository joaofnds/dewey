`ob-go` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to provide Org-Babel support for evaluating Go code within the Org-mode environment. This project enables users to execute and interact with Go code snippets directly within their Org files, facilitating reproducible research and literate programming workflows. Leveraging Emacs Lisp, it integrates Go language execution into Org-mode's capabilities, making it a developer productivity tool for users of both Org-mode and the Go programming language.
