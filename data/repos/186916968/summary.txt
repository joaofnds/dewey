`ttl.sh` is a TypeScript-based project providing an ephemeral Docker container registry designed for continuous integration (CI) workflows. It leverages the official Docker Registry image, offering a configuration for anonymous, self-expiring image storage. The project's key functionality allows for temporary storage of Docker images, eliminating the need for persistent registry infrastructure. Development utilizes Okteto for building and debugging, with integration steps outlined in the documentation. This is a standalone application, a developer productivity tool specifically focused on simplifying CI workflows.
