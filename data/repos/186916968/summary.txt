ttl.sh is an anonymous, ephemeral Docker container registry designed for CI/CD workflows and temporary image storage. Built with TypeScript and leveraging the official Docker Registry image, it provides a self-expiring container registry that requires no authentication, allowing developers to push and pull Docker images with automatic cleanup through TTL (time-to-live) mechanisms. The system includes supporting services like ttl-hooks and ttl-reaper for lifecycle management, deployed via Kubernetes with Okteto for development workflows. This DevOps tool addresses the common problem of accumulating temporary container images during continuous integration processes, providing a lightweight alternative to permanent registries for testing, development, and ephemeral deployment scenarios where image persistence beyond a defined timeframe is unnecessary.
