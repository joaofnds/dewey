pprof is a performance profiling visualization and analysis tool written in Go that processes statistical profiling data in protocol buffer format. Targeting DevOps engineers, backend developers, and performance engineers, it addresses the critical problem of identifying performance bottlenecks in applications through CPU, memory, and execution profiling. The tool reads profile.proto formatted data from local files or HTTP endpoints, providing multiple output formats including interactive command-line interface, web-based GUI, SVG graphs via Graphviz, and text reports. It integrates with native debugging tools (addr2line, nm) for symbol resolution and supports Linux perf data conversion, enabling comprehensive performance analysis workflows for system optimization and debugging in production environments.
