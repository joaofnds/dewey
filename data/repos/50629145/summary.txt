`pprof` is a Go-based command-line tool for the visualization and analysis of profiling data, specifically designed for performance analysis. It processes profiling samples in `profile.proto` format, generating text-based and graphical reports, including SVG visualizations. Key functionalities include the ability to read profiles from files or HTTP endpoints, symbolize machine addresses, and integrate with tools like Linux Perf. As a standalone application, `pprof` provides both a CLI and a web interface for interactive exploration and refinement of profiling data, targeting developers for optimizing application performance.
