RBS is a type signature language and toolchain for Ruby that enables static type checking and documentation of Ruby programs. It provides a DSL for describing class structures, method signatures, instance variables, inheritance relationships, and type annotations including union types, optional types, and generics. The system includes a CLI tool for prototype generation from existing Ruby code, validation of type signatures, and introspection of type definitions. RBS targets Ruby developers working on large-scale applications who need static analysis capabilities, offering an environment and definition system for managing type declarations and a builder API for programmatic access to type information. It addresses Ruby's dynamic typing limitations by providing optional static type checking without runtime overhead.
