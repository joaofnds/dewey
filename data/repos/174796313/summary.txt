`ruby/rbs` is a Ruby library and command-line tool for defining and utilizing type signatures for Ruby programs. Its core function is to provide a language and supporting tools for type-checking Ruby code, enabling developers to specify class and module structures, including method signatures, instance variables, and inheritance relationships. Key features include the ability to generate signature declarations from existing Ruby code, build environments for type resolution, and integrate with Ruby's type system. The project centers around the "RBS" language, a domain-specific language (DSL), and supports libraries, CLI tooling, and editor integrations, thus targeting Ruby developers focused on improving code quality and maintainability through static analysis and type safety.
