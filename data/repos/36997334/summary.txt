This TypeScript library implements the Redlock algorithm for distributed locking across multiple Redis instances or clusters in Node.js applications. Targeting backend developers building distributed systems, it provides mutex-like synchronization primitives for coordinating access to shared resources across multiple application instances. The library integrates with ioredis for Redis connectivity and offers both auto-extending locks via async/await patterns and manual lock acquisition/release mechanisms. It addresses race conditions and resource contention in microservices architectures, distributed databases, and high-availability web applications where multiple processes need exclusive access to critical sections or shared state, particularly in scenarios requiring fault tolerance through Redis cluster consensus.
