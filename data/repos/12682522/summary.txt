`Postgrex` is an Elixir driver for PostgreSQL, providing a high-performance interface for interacting with PostgreSQL databases. It enables Elixir applications to execute SQL queries, supporting features like binary format encoding/decoding of Elixir values to and from PostgreSQL, transactions, prepared queries, and connection pooling through `DBConnection`. The library includes support for user-defined extensions for encoding and decoding custom PostgreSQL types, JSON support via integration with the `Jason` library, and compatibility with PostgreSQL versions 8.4 and later. This project is a library intended for Elixir developers needing database interaction within their applications.
