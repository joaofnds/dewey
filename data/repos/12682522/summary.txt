Postgrex is a PostgreSQL database driver for Elixir applications, providing native connectivity between Elixir/Erlang applications and PostgreSQL databases. Built on the DBConnection framework, it handles automatic encoding/decoding of Elixir data types to PostgreSQL's binary format, supports prepared statements, transactions, and connection pooling. The driver maps PostgreSQL types (timestamps, arrays, JSON, UUIDs, ranges) to corresponding Elixir structs and primitives, enabling seamless data interchange. Targeted at Elixir backend developers building web applications, APIs, and data-driven systems, Postgrex serves as the foundational database layer for Phoenix web applications and other Elixir services requiring PostgreSQL persistence, supporting versions from PostgreSQL 8.4 through modern releases with extensible type system architecture.
