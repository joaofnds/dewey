PDF.js is a JavaScript-based PDF rendering engine that enables native PDF viewing in web browsers without plugins. Developed by Mozilla, it parses and renders PDF documents using HTML5 Canvas and Web Workers for performance optimization. The library targets web developers building document management systems, content viewers, or any web application requiring PDF display capabilities. It provides both a standalone viewer and an embeddable API for integration into existing applications. The project uses Node.js for build tooling with Gulp, supports modern and legacy browser environments, and is distributed via NPM as `pdfjs-dist`. PDF.js solves the cross-platform PDF viewing problem in web environments, eliminating dependencies on browser-specific plugins while maintaining compatibility with the PDF specification for document fidelity.
