This repository provides the official Alpine Linux Docker base image, a minimal 5.58MB container image designed for DevOps and containerization workflows. Built on Alpine Linux with BusyBox and the APK package manager, it serves as a lightweight alternative to larger base images like Ubuntu (64MB) or CentOS (202MB) for Docker container development. The image targets Docker developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who need to optimize container size and build times while maintaining access to a comprehensive package repository. It solves the problem of bloated container images by providing a security-focused, musl libc-based Linux distribution that reduces deployment overhead, network transfer costs, and attack surface area in production containerized applications and microservices architectures.
