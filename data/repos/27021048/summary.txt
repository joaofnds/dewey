wakatime-mode is an Emacs Lisp minor mode that provides automatic time tracking integration with the WakaTime service for software developers using the Emacs text editor. The plugin hooks into Emacs buffer activities to send "heartbeats" via the wakatime-cli command-line tool, capturing programming metrics including time spent in different projects, files, and programming languages. It targets software developers across all domains who use Emacs as their primary development environment and want passive productivity analytics without manual time logging. The implementation leverages Emacs's minor mode architecture and integrates with the broader WakaTime ecosystem through API calls, enabling developers to generate detailed coding activity reports and productivity dashboards. Installation involves configuring the wakatime-cli path, API authentication, and enabling the global minor mode in the Emacs initialization configuration.
