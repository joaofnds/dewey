`lieer` is a Python application designed for efficient email management, specifically facilitating email fetching, sending, and two-way tag synchronization between the `notmuch` email system and GMail. It enables users to bridge the functionalities of a local email client (like `notmuch`) with a cloud-based service (Gmail). The core functionality revolves around seamless interaction between these two email platforms, addressing the need for unified tag management and synchronized mailboxes. This standalone application likely targets users who utilize both local and cloud-based email workflows and value a unified management interface.
