Lieer is a Python-based email synchronization tool that bridges Gmail and the notmuch email indexing system for technical users managing email workflows outside traditional clients. It leverages the Gmail API to perform bidirectional synchronization of messages and labels between Gmail accounts and local maildir storage, with tags synchronized to a notmuch database. The tool handles OAuth authentication, supports sending emails through Gmail's API as a sendmail replacement, and provides granular control over tag/label mapping and synchronization rules. Built for system administrators, developers, and power users who prefer command-line email management, Lieer solves the problem of maintaining offline email access and advanced search capabilities through notmuch while preserving Gmail's web interface functionality and label system integration.
