Ponyc is the compiler implementation for the Pony programming language, an actor-model concurrent programming language designed for systems programming and high-performance applications. Built primarily in C, it targets developers building concurrent, distributed systems requiring memory safety and data-race freedom through capabilities-based security. The compiler supports cross-platform deployment on Linux, macOS, and Windows across x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures. Pony addresses the fundamental problem of safe concurrent programming by eliminating data races at compile-time while maintaining native performance, making it suitable for backend services, distributed systems, and performance-critical applications where traditional languages struggle with concurrent memory management and actor-based concurrency patterns.
