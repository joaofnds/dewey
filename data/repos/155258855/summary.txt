`tech.datatype` is a Clojure library designed for efficient numerical operations on n-dimensional data structures, targeting scientific computing and data processing. It provides abstractions for working with sequences of primitive datatypes across various container types, including Java arrays, array views, and NIO buffers. Core functionalities include datatype identification, read/write operations, construction, mutable copy operations, sparse buffer support, n-dimensional tensor support, and functional math capabilities. This library is a Clojure-based numerics library designed to provide high performance numerical processing capabilities.
