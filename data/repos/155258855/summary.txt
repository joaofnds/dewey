`tech.datatype` is a Clojure library providing efficient N-dimensional numerical computing capabilities for JVM applications, targeting data science and scientific computing domains. The library implements optimized operations on primitive datatypes across various container types including Java arrays, array views, and NIO buffers, with specialized support for n-dimensional tensors, sparse buffers, and functional mathematical operations. It offers type-safe read/write operations, efficient mutable copying, and includes advanced features like datetime support and APL-style array programming capabilities. Designed for Clojure developers working with large-scale numerical data processing, machine learning pipelines, and scientific applications requiring high-performance array operations, though it has been superseded by dtype-next for improved runtime performance and Graal Native compilation support.
