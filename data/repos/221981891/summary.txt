Playwright is a cross-browser web testing and automation framework built in TypeScript that provides a unified API for testing Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. Targeting web developers and QA engineers, it addresses the challenge of reliable end-to-end testing across multiple browser engines by offering auto-wait mechanisms, web-first assertions, and browser context isolation to eliminate flaky tests. The framework supports headless and headed execution, provides built-in test runner capabilities, and includes developer tools like code generation, tracing, and debugging features. Playwright enables testing of complex web scenarios including multi-tab workflows, authentication states, and shadow DOM interactions, making it a comprehensive solution for modern web application testing and browser automation tasks.
