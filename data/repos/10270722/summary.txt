go-github is a comprehensive Go client library that provides programmatic access to GitHub's REST API v3, enabling developers to integrate GitHub functionality into their applications and automation workflows. Targeting the DevOps, developer tooling, and software development domains, this library wraps GitHub's extensive API surface area into idiomatic Go interfaces for operations like repository management, issue tracking, pull request handling, organization administration, and user management. Built with Go's standard HTTP client and context package for request lifecycle management, it supports multiple authentication methods including OAuth tokens, personal access tokens, and GitHub Apps authentication. The library serves Go developers building CI/CD pipelines, developer productivity tools, GitHub integrations, and automated workflows who need reliable, type-safe access to GitHub's platform capabilities without manually handling HTTP requests and JSON parsing.
