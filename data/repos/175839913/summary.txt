Semantic is a Haskell-based static analysis tool for parsing, analyzing, and comparing source code across multiple programming languages including Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, PHP, and Java. Built on tree-sitter grammar definitions, it generates language-specific AST representations and provides symbol extraction capabilities primarily used for GitHub's code navigation features. The tool implements advanced diff algorithms including Myers' SES and RWS-Diff for hierarchical data comparison, along with abstracting definitional interpreters for semantic analysis. Targeting software engineers, platform developers, and tooling teams in the developer tools ecosystem, semantic serves as infrastructure for code intelligence features, enabling parse tree generation, symbol extraction, and cross-language source code analysis through both command-line interfaces and protocol buffer APIs.
