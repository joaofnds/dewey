`Semantic` is a Haskell library and command-line tool designed for parsing, analyzing, and comparing source code across multiple programming languages. Its core functionality includes generating parse trees, providing symbol lists, and enabling code navigation features. The architecture leverages tree-sitter for language parsing and supports languages like Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Go. This project is a developer productivity tool, specifically a library and command-line application, useful for code analysis and potentially supporting tasks like code navigation on platforms like GitHub.
