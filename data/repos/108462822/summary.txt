Contour is a Kubernetes ingress controller that manages external access to cluster services by deploying Envoy proxy as a reverse proxy and load balancer. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform administrators in cloud-native environments, it provides dynamic traffic routing and configuration updates through multiple APIs including standard Kubernetes Ingress, custom HTTPProxy CRDs, and the emerging Gateway API specification. Built for enterprise Kubernetes deployments, Contour solves ingress complexity by offering advanced load balancing, TLS termination, and traffic management capabilities while maintaining lightweight resource consumption. As a CNCF project, it serves system administrators and SREs who need production-grade ingress solutions with Envoy's powerful proxy features integrated seamlessly into Kubernetes networking infrastructure.
