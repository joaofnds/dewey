Contour is a Kubernetes ingress controller leveraging the Envoy proxy for traffic management. It provides dynamic configuration updates and supports the Ingress, HTTPProxy, and Gateway API resources for configuring routing rules and load balancing within a Kubernetes cluster. This standalone application, developed in Go, allows users to expose services running inside the Kubernetes cluster to external clients, targeting system administrators and Kubernetes developers managing cloud-native applications and services.
