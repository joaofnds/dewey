Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline built with Java and JRuby that serves as part of the Elastic Stack for real-time ETL operations. It ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it through configurable processing rules, and outputs it to various destinations, primarily Elasticsearch. The framework features over 200 plugins for input sources, filters, and output targets, with extensibility through custom Ruby gems. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and data engineers, Logstash solves centralized log aggregation and real-time data transformation challenges in distributed systems. It handles streaming data processing for monitoring, observability, and analytics use cases, supporting various data formats and providing a scalable solution for organizations managing large volumes of log events and structured data across their infrastructure.
