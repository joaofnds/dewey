Logstash is a server-side data processing pipeline designed for real-time ingestion, transformation, and transport of logs, events, and other data. Built primarily in Java and leveraging JRuby for scripting and plugin extensibility, it functions as an ETL framework, supporting a wide array of input and output plugins. Core functionality includes data collection from diverse sources, processing via over 200 plugins, and forwarding to various destinations, with a strong emphasis on integration with the Elastic Stack, particularly Elasticsearch. This is a standalone application, primarily aimed at system administrators and developers working with data pipelines and logging infrastructure, offering a robust platform for data streaming and real-time processing.
