Gatsby is a React-based static site generator framework for web development that combines static site generation with dynamic React applications. It uses GraphQL as a unified data layer to pull content from multiple sources including headless CMS platforms, Markdown files, and REST/GraphQL APIs, then compiles them into optimized static websites. The framework targets frontend developers and web agencies building content-rich websites, blogs, and e-commerce platforms that require high performance and SEO optimization. Gatsby implements automatic code splitting, image optimization, lazy loading, and prefetching to achieve superior Core Web Vitals scores. It supports multiple rendering modes including Static Site Generation (SSG), Deferred Static Generation (DSG), and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), allowing developers to choose optimal rendering strategies per page while maintaining a modern JavaScript development workflow.
