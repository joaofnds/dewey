imgproxy is a high-performance standalone HTTP server built in Go for real-time image processing operations including resizing, format conversion, and optimization. Leveraging libvips for efficient image manipulation, it serves as a microservice replacement for ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick workflows in web applications. The server supports modern formats (AVIF, WebP, JPEG, PNG) with URL-based parameter passing and cryptographic signature validation for security. Designed for web developers and DevOps engineers managing image-heavy applications, it addresses performance bottlenecks in dynamic image processing pipelines by offloading resize operations from application code. The solution integrates with CDNs and caching proxies, providing a Docker-deployable alternative to client-side image processing libraries in production web environments.
