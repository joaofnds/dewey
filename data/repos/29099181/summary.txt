The `keybase/client` repository hosts the client applications and core libraries for the Keybase secure messaging and file sharing platform. Built primarily in Go, it provides end-to-end encrypted communication, incorporating features like chat, file storage (KBFS), and PGP key management. This project encompasses cross-platform client applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android, leveraging React Native for shared UI components and Electron for desktop applications. It includes a command-line client, core cryptographic libraries, and a protocol definition using Avro for communication with Keybase services; it is a standalone, cross-platform application and service.
