Keybase is a comprehensive cryptographic communication platform implementing end-to-end encryption for messaging, file sharing, and identity verification across multiple platforms. The repository contains Go-based core cryptographic libraries and services, React Native mobile applications for iOS/Android, and Electron desktop clients for macOS/Windows/Linux. It features PGP key management, a distributed filesystem (KBFS), secure chat functionality, and cross-platform protocol definitions using Avro. The platform targets developers and security-conscious users requiring verified encrypted communication channels, combining public key cryptography with social proof mechanisms. The codebase spans mobile development, desktop applications, and backend services, utilizing Go for cryptographic operations, React/React Native for user interfaces, and comprehensive packaging systems for multi-platform deployment in the cybersecurity and encrypted communications domain.
