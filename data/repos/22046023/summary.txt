Flux is an archived JavaScript application architecture designed for building user interfaces, specifically for React applications. It provides a unidirectional data flow model, comprising a Dispatcher and utility classes like `ReduceStore`, to manage application state and interactions. This project, a library/framework, enables developers to structure their React applications by separating data flow from the view components. Key technologies include JavaScript and dependencies on `EventEmitter` and `React`, with a focus on a pattern rather than a fully-featured framework. The target audience is frontend developers.
