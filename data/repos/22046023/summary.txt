Flux is an archived JavaScript application architecture library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces in React applications. It implements a unidirectional data flow pattern to manage application state through a centralized Dispatcher, Stores, and Actions, addressing the complexity of state management in large-scale web applications. The library provides core utilities including a Dispatcher class and base Store classes like ReduceStore, along with EventEmitter integration for reactive updates. Targeted at frontend web developers building React applications, Flux solves the problem of unpredictable state mutations and complex data flow in interactive UIs by enforcing a strict unidirectional architecture. Facebook has officially archived this project, recommending modern alternatives like Redux, MobX, Recoil, and Zustand for contemporary React state management needs.
