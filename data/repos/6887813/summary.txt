The Crystal programming language repository contains the complete implementation of a statically-typed, compiled programming language designed for systems and web development. Crystal combines Ruby-like syntax with static type inference and compiles to efficient native code, targeting developers who want Ruby's expressiveness without runtime performance penalties. The compiler, written in Crystal itself, features automatic type checking, C bindings support, compile-time code generation, and cross-platform compatibility across Linux, macOS, Windows, and AArch64 architectures. This language serves backend developers, systems programmers, and web developers who need the productivity of dynamic languages like Ruby but require the performance characteristics of compiled languages like C, making it suitable for building web servers, CLI tools, system utilities, and performance-critical applications where both developer productivity and runtime efficiency are essential.
