The `crystal-lang/crystal` repository hosts the Crystal programming language, a statically-typed language designed for building efficient and performant applications. Crystal aims to combine Ruby's developer-friendly syntax with the speed of native C code by compiling to native executables. Key features include static typing without explicit type declarations, interoperability with C code through bindings, and compile-time code generation. This project is a programming language implementation and compiler, targeting developers seeking a high-performance alternative to Ruby.
