This Common Lisp library provides Clojure-inspired programming constructs and utilities for Common Lisp developers who want to incorporate functional programming patterns from the Clojure ecosystem. The project bridges language paradigms by implementing Clojure's convenient abstractions and idioms within Common Lisp's environment, allowing developers to leverage Clojure's design philosophies while maintaining Common Lisp's flexibility and performance characteristics. Targeted at functional programming enthusiasts and Common Lisp developers, it addresses the challenge of cross-pollinating useful programming constructs between related Lisp dialects. The library serves the general software development domain, particularly for developers working on functional programming projects who appreciate Clojure's ergonomics but prefer Common Lisp's mature ecosystem and implementation choices.
