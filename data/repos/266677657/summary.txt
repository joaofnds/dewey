`microfeed/microfeed` is a serverless, self-hosted content management system (CMS) built on Cloudflare, designed for individuals and small businesses to publish diverse content types including podcasts, blogs, photos, videos, documents, and curated URLs.  It leverages Cloudflare's Pages, R2, D1, and Zero Trust services for hosting, storage, database, and access control, eliminating the need for traditional server management.  Written in JavaScript, the application provides a user-friendly admin dashboard for content creation and management, offering web, RSS, and JSON feed outputs, making it suitable for tech-savvy users seeking a cost-effective and easily deployed content publishing solution. This project is a standalone web application.
