Microfeed is a serverless content management system built for web developers and content creators who want to self-host lightweight publishing platforms on Cloudflare's infrastructure. The JavaScript-based CMS leverages Cloudflare Pages for hosting, D1 SQLite database for metadata storage, R2 object storage for media files, and Zero Trust for authentication to create multi-format content feeds (web, RSS, JSON). It addresses the need for cost-effective, scalable content publishing without traditional server management, supporting podcasts, blogs, photo galleries, video feeds, and curated link collections. The system targets technically proficient users who prefer serverless architectures and want to maintain full control over their content distribution while benefiting from Cloudflare's global CDN and generous free tier quotas for personal and small business publishing needs.
