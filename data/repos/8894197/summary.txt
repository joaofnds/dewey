Loom is a Clojure library providing graph data structure implementations and associated algorithms. It offers functionalities for creating, manipulating, and traversing graphs, including support for directed, weighted, and attributed graphs. Key features include graph generation, input/output operations, pathfinding algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra), and graph visualization through integration with GraphViz. This library is primarily a Clojure-specific project aimed at developers working with graph data structures and algorithms within the Clojure ecosystem.
