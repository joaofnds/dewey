Loom is a comprehensive graph theory library for Clojure that provides data structures and algorithms for working with directed, undirected, and weighted graphs. It targets developers in computational domains including data science, network analysis, and algorithm research who need to perform graph-based computations. The library implements core graph algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path, breadth-first and depth-first traversal, topological sorting, and connected components analysis. Built entirely in Clojure, it offers immutable graph data structures with support for attributes, labels, and various graph formats through integration with GraphViz for visualization. Loom addresses the need for a native Clojure graph processing toolkit, enabling functional programming approaches to problems in social network analysis, routing algorithms, dependency resolution, and other graph-theoretic applications where JVM interoperability and Clojure's data manipulation capabilities are advantageous.
