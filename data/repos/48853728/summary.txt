Montrose is a Ruby library for modeling and enumerating recurring events in web applications, primarily targeting Ruby developers working with calendar and scheduling systems. It provides a chainable DSL for defining complex recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and generates enumerable sequences of Time objects representing event occurrences. The library supports serialization to YAML, Hash, and iCal formats, making it suitable for integration with persistence layers and calendar applications. Built with Ruby idioms and Enumerable patterns, it addresses the common problem of handling recurring events in Ruby applications without the complexity of full calendaring systems or job scheduling frameworks like cron or sidekiq-cron, focusing specifically on event recurrence logic rather than execution scheduling.
