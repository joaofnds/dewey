Montrose is a Ruby library providing a chainable interface for defining and enumerating recurring events. It enables the modeling and generation of time-based recurrence patterns, supporting various frequency types and custom rules for specifying event schedules. Key features include a fluent API for constructing recurrence objects, integration with Ruby's `Enumerable` interface for event iteration, and serialization to YAML, hash, and iCalendar formats. This library is designed for Ruby developers needing to manage recurring events within their applications and incorporates ActiveSupport for time calculations.
