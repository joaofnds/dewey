This Go package provides high-performance implementations of encoding, decoding, and validation APIs for data formats including JSON, Protocol Buffers, ASCII, and ISO8601. Developed by Segment for high-throughput data processing infrastructure, it serves as drop-in replacements for Go's standard library encoding packages with significant performance improvements - achieving up to 80% faster JSON unmarshaling and 99% memory allocation reduction compared to `encoding/json`. The library targets backend developers and infrastructure engineers working on data-intensive applications involving message queuing, serialization, and data pipeline processing. It maintains API compatibility with standard library packages while leveraging optimized algorithms and memory management techniques, making it particularly valuable for microservices, event streaming platforms, and high-scale distributed systems where encoding/decoding performance directly impacts infrastructure costs and system throughput.
