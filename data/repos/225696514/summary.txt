The `segmentio/encoding` repository is a Go package providing high-performance implementations for encoding, decoding, and validation of various data formats, primarily focusing on JSON and ISO8601 date representations. It offers drop-in replacement APIs for Go's standard `encoding/json` package with significantly improved CPU and memory efficiency, particularly for unmarshaling JSON data. Functionality includes JSON marshaling/unmarshaling and ISO8601 date validation to optimize date parsing. This is a library designed for Go developers working on applications that require efficient data serialization, deserialization, and validation, especially within high-volume data processing environments.
