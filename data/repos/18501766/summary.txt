Poison is a high-performance JSON library for the Elixir programming language, designed for fast JSON encoding and decoding operations. It offers a hand-rolled parser utilizing sub-binary matching and single-pass decoding techniques to achieve speed, while conforming to RFC 8259 and ECMA 404 standards and passing the JSONTestSuite. The library provides both encoder and decoder functionalities, including options for deriving encoders with attribute selection and key validation, enabling users to efficiently parse and serialize JSON data within Elixir applications, and providing an API via modules `Poison.encode!`, `Poison.decode!`, and `Poison.Parser.parse!`. This project is a library specifically for Elixir developers.
