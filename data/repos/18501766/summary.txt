Poison is a high-performance JSON parsing and encoding library for Elixir applications, targeting web developers and backend engineers working in the Erlang/BEAM ecosystem. The library implements RFC 8259 and ECMA 404 compliant JSON processing using hand-optimized parsing techniques including sub-binary matching, IO list encoding, and single-pass decoding optimized for BeamAsm JIT compilation. It provides encoder/decoder functionality with struct serialization support via protocol derivation, customizable key handling (string/atom conversion), and modular components that can be used independently. Poison solves the critical need for fast JSON processing in Elixir web services, APIs, and data transformation pipelines, offering performance comparable to native Erlang libraries like jiffy while maintaining pure Elixir implementation for better integration with Phoenix applications and OTP systems.
