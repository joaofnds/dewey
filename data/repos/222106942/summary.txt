Notespace is a Clojure-based literate programming tool designed to provide notebook-like functionality directly within Clojure namespaces, eliminating the need to switch editors. Targeting data scientists and researchers in the Clojure ecosystem, it transforms regular Clojure code files into interactive notebooks with visualization capabilities through integration with the Kindly specification system. The project addresses the gap between traditional REPL-driven development and notebook environments like Jupyter, enabling documentation, data analysis, and exploratory programming workflows while maintaining the familiar Clojure development experience. Currently on hold in favor of Clay, a successor project, Notespace was primarily used within the Scicloj community for research projects and library documentation, competing with alternatives like Gorilla REPL, Clojupyter, and Clerk in the Clojure literate programming space.
