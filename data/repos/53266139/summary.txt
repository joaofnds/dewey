BoostNote-Legacy is a cross-platform note-taking application specifically designed for programmers and software developers. Built using Electron for desktop deployment across macOS, Windows, and Linux, the application leverages React with Redux for state management, Webpack for module bundling, and CSS Modules for styling. The tool addresses the unique documentation and knowledge management needs of developers by providing a structured environment for technical note-taking, code snippets, and programming-related documentation. As a desktop-first application targeting the software development domain, it serves programmers who require offline-capable, cross-platform note organization with developer-centric features. This legacy version has been superseded by a newer collaborative version, but represents a foundational JavaScript-based solution for developer productivity and technical documentation workflows.
