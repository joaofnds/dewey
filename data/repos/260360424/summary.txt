This Vim plugin provides comprehensive key remappings to adapt Vim's default QWERTY-based navigation and editing commands for the Colemak-DH keyboard layout. It targets developers and power users who have switched to the ergonomic Colemak layout but want to maintain efficient Vim workflows without relearning muscle memory. The plugin remaps core Vim motions (hjkl becomes hnie), editing commands (insert/append/change), text objects, window navigation, and visual mode operations to align with Colemak key positions. It addresses plugin conflicts (notably with vim-fugitive), provides installation instructions for vim-plug, and includes options for turbo navigation. The solution enables Colemak users to leverage Vim's modal editing paradigm while preserving the ergonomic benefits of their alternative keyboard layout, primarily serving the text editor customization and developer tooling domain.
