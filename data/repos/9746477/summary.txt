Sonic Pi is an open-source live coding environment for music synthesis and performance, built primarily in C++ with Ruby scripting capabilities. It functions as a code-based digital audio workstation that enables real-time music creation through programming, targeting music education, live performance, and creative coding domains. The platform implements audio synthesis engines, concurrent programming models for temporal music sequencing, and MIDI/OSC protocol support for external hardware integration. It addresses the intersection of computer science education and music pedagogy by providing a programming interface for sound generation, beat sequencing, and live performance coding. Primary users include music educators, live coding performers, electronic musicians, and students learning programming concepts through creative audio applications, particularly in educational settings where computational thinking is taught through music creation.
