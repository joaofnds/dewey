`bbin` is a cross-platform package manager for Babashka that enables one-command installation of Clojure/ClojureScript CLI tools and scripts. Built in Clojure, it targets DevOps and developer tooling workflows by automatically resolving dependencies from Git repositories, Maven coordinates, URLs, or local files, then generating self-contained shell scripts in `~/.local/bin`. The tool addresses the distribution and installation challenge for Babashka-based command-line utilities, allowing developers to easily share and install scripts across Linux, macOS, and Windows environments. It supports various installation sources including GitHub repositories, Gists, JAR files, and local projects, making it particularly valuable for Clojure developers building automation scripts, build tools, and development utilities that need simple distribution mechanisms without complex deployment processes.
