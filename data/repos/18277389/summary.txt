This repository contains a comprehensive educational resource titled "What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell" - an extensive tutorial and reference guide for functional programming in Haskell. The project serves the software development education domain, specifically targeting developers learning advanced functional programming concepts. It features 34 chapters covering core Haskell topics including monads, monad transformers, type system extensions, laziness evaluation, applicative functors, GADTs, lambda calculus, parser combinators, concurrency, Template Haskell, and category theory. The repository includes executable code examples, continuous integration testing, and generates multiple output formats (HTML, PDF, EPUB, MOBI) from Markdown source. It addresses the steep learning curve associated with Haskell by providing practical examples and explanations of complex functional programming patterns, making it valuable for intermediate to advanced developers transitioning from imperative to functional programming paradigms.
