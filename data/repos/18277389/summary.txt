`wiwinwlh` is an article series and example project providing an in-depth tutorial on learning Haskell and functional programming concepts. It covers a wide range of topics including monads, monad transformers, type families, generics, and more, with accompanying code examples. The project is primarily a tutorial resource formatted into multiple digital formats (HTML, PDF, EPUB, MOBI) and targets individuals learning and exploring Haskell development. Example code is provided and tested for each chapter using the `ci` script that compiles against dependencies specified in a Cabal file.
