Bootstrap Icons is the official SVG icon library for the Bootstrap web development framework, providing over 2,000 optimized vector icons for web applications and user interfaces. Built with TypeScript and distributed via npm and Composer, it targets front-end developers and web designers working on Bootstrap-based projects or general web development. The repository includes automated SVG optimization using SVGO, font generation capabilities (WOFF/WOFF2), sprite compilation, and Hugo-based documentation site generation. It solves the common problem of consistent, scalable iconography in web interfaces by offering multiple implementation methods including embedded SVG, image references, CSS integration, and sprite sheets, while maintaining design consistency with Bootstrap's visual system and ensuring cross-browser compatibility through optimized vector graphics.
