`minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings` is a Python-based dataset and related tooling designed to aid in software quality assurance and testing by providing a comprehensive list of strings likely to cause issues when used as user input. It provides newline-delimited strings (`blns.txt`) and a JSON file (`blns.json`) for programmatic access, with comments to categorize the strings. The repository's core functionality centers on offering a resource for identifying potential bugs and vulnerabilities in applications by simulating problematic user input scenarios, targeting developers and testers seeking to improve software robustness. It is implemented in Python, and the script within the repository suggests Python is the primary language.
