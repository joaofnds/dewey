The Big List of Naughty Strings is a curated collection of edge-case input strings designed for software quality assurance and security testing across web development and application testing domains. The repository provides a comprehensive dataset of problematic string inputs including Unicode edge cases, SQL injection vectors, XSS payloads, buffer overflow attempts, and encoding anomalies that commonly cause application failures or expose vulnerabilities. Available in both plain text (blns.txt) and JSON formats, it serves QA engineers, security testers, and developers conducting input validation testing for web applications, APIs, and user-facing software systems. The resource addresses the critical need for systematic edge-case testing in string handling, helping identify weaknesses in input sanitization, character encoding, and data validation implementations before production deployment.
