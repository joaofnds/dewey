Sinon.JS is a comprehensive JavaScript testing utility library that provides test doubles (spies, stubs, and mocks) for unit testing and test-driven development. Designed for web developers working in JavaScript environments, it operates as a standalone, framework-agnostic solution that integrates seamlessly with any testing framework without global pollution. The library enables developers to intercept function calls, replace method implementations, verify interactions, and fake browser APIs including timers. Key features include call tracking through spies, behavior replacement via stubs, and expectation setting with mocks. Sinon addresses the critical testing challenge of isolating units of code by controlling dependencies and external interactions, making it essential for JavaScript developers practicing TDD/BDD methodologies across Node.js and browser environments.
