Sinon.JS is a JavaScript library providing test spies, stubs, and mocks, designed to facilitate unit testing and test-driven development (TDD). It allows developers to create and manage test doubles for JavaScript code, enabling isolation of units during testing. The library's primary functionality includes the ability to spy on function calls, stub method implementations, and mock entire objects, making it easier to verify behavior and dependencies in JavaScript projects. This is a developer productivity library, specifically targeting JavaScript developers focused on writing robust unit tests.
