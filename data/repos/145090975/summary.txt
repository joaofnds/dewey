**errorx** is a comprehensive error handling library for Go that enhances the language's basic error mechanisms with structured error types, automatic stack trace collection, and composable error decoration. Designed for Go backend developers and system programmers, it addresses limitations in Go's standard error handling by providing hierarchical error types, trait-based error classification, and rich debugging context. The library enables developers to create typed errors with automatic stack traces, decorate errors with additional context while preserving original semantics, and perform robust type checking without relying on string comparison. It replaces Go's primitive `errors.New()` with a more sophisticated system that maintains error composability while providing essential debugging information for production systems and complex applications.
