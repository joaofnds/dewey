`errorx` is a Go library providing enhanced error handling capabilities, specifically designed for Go developers. It addresses limitations in Go's standard error handling by offering features such as stack trace capture, error composability, and type/trait-based error checking. The library facilitates the creation of expressive error messages with contextual information and supports error wrapping and decoration to preserve original error details.  It is a developer productivity library intended to improve debugging and maintainability within Go projects, focused on concise error syntax and discouraging error handling patterns that hinder debugging efficiency, particularly in the Go programming language.
