**samber/do** is a type-safe dependency injection (DI) container library for Go 1.18+ that leverages generics to provide compile-time type safety for service registration and resolution. Targeting backend Go developers building web applications, microservices, and enterprise software, it implements the inversion of control (IoC) pattern with features including service lifecycle management, health checking, graceful shutdown, dependency graph resolution, and both eager/lazy service loading. The library serves as a lightweight alternative to uber/dig, offering named and anonymous service registration, injector cloning, service override capabilities, and signal-based shutdown handling. It addresses the need for clean dependency management in Go applications without requiring code generation or external dependencies, making it suitable for developers building scalable server-side applications who need structured service orchestration and lifecycle management.
