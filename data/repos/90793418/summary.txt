`fd` is a high-performance command-line file search utility written in Rust, designed as a modern replacement for the traditional Unix `find` command. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers working in terminal environments, it provides parallelized filesystem traversal with regex and glob pattern matching capabilities. The tool integrates with Git workflows by respecting `.gitignore` patterns, offers smart case-insensitive searching, syntax highlighting for different file types, and supports parallel command execution on search results. Built using Rust's performance-oriented ecosystem, it addresses the usability and speed limitations of traditional file search tools while maintaining compatibility with existing shell scripting workflows and terminal-based development environments.
