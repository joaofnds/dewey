`fd` is a command-line tool, written in Rust, designed as a user-friendly and fast alternative to the `find` utility for locating files within a filesystem. It features intuitive syntax, supports regular expressions and glob patterns, leverages parallel directory traversal for performance, and offers options for color-coded output, hidden file searching, and integration with `.gitignore` files. This standalone CLI application also provides command execution capabilities, allowing users to run external commands on search results, along with options for filtering by file type, extension, size, and modification time, targeting system administrators and developers who need a performant and flexible file search tool.
