Weaver is a Linux-based tracing tool for Go programs that leverages eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and uprobes to dynamically inspect function arguments during runtime execution. Built for DevOps engineers and Go developers working in observability and debugging domains, it operates by attaching eBPF programs to user-space probes without requiring code modification or recompilation. The tool supports two operational modes: function-file based tracing with explicit type specifications for detailed argument value extraction, and package-based tracing for broader function call monitoring. It targets system-level debugging, performance analysis, and runtime program inspection use cases, requiring BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) and Linux kernel 4.14+ as dependencies. The project represents early-stage dynamic instrumentation technology now integrated into commercial APM solutions.
