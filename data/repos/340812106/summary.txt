Lisp-Stat is a comprehensive statistical computing environment built in Common Lisp, designed to provide vectorized mathematical operations and advanced statistical methods using modern numerical algorithms. The system targets data scientists and statisticians who require sophisticated analytical capabilities within a dynamic programming environment, leveraging Common Lisp's REPL, CLOS object system, and meta-object protocol. Built on a modular architecture of specialized libraries including data-frame for tabular data manipulation, dfio for data I/O operations, numerical-utilities for mathematical computations, special-functions for statistical functions, and array-operations for efficient array processing, it serves as a modern successor to XLISP-STAT with backward compatibility support. The platform addresses the need for a robust, interactive statistical computing environment that combines the expressiveness of Lisp with comprehensive statistical functionality, enabling complex data analysis workflows through programmatic manipulation of datasets, statistical modeling, and numerical computation.
