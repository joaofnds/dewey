vim-surround is a Vim text editor plugin written in Vim Script that provides efficient text manipulation operations for managing paired delimiters including parentheses, brackets, quotes, and XML/HTML tags. The plugin introduces three core commands: `cs` (change surroundings), `ds` (delete surroundings), and `ys` (add surroundings), along with visual mode integration using `S`. It targets web developers, software engineers, and technical writers who frequently edit HTML, XML, and code files requiring rapid modification of nested structures and paired characters. The plugin addresses the common problem of tediously editing opening and closing delimiters simultaneously by providing atomic operations that maintain syntactic integrity. It integrates with Vim's text objects and motion system, supports the dot command for repetition via vim-repeat, and is particularly valuable for HTML/XML editing workflows where manipulating tag pairs is frequent.
