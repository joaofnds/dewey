Kui is a framework for enhancing command-line interfaces (CLIs) with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), specifically targeting cloud-native development within the Kubernetes ecosystem. It transforms standard `kubectl` commands into interactive visualizations and provides a faster execution environment compared to the native `kubectl`. Built with TypeScript and leveraging Electron for cross-platform application distribution, Kui enables developers to create custom graphical CLI extensions, facilitating a more user-friendly and efficient Kubernetes management experience. It functions as a standalone application and a plugin, appealing to Kubernetes users seeking improved CLI interaction.
