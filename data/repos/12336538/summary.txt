Elfeed is an extensible web feed reader implemented in Emacs Lisp for the Emacs text editor ecosystem. This RSS/Atom feed aggregator targets Emacs power users and developers who prefer staying within their editor environment for content consumption. The system features a SQLite-backed database for feed storage, supports concurrent feed fetching via cURL integration, and provides a tag-based filtering system for content organization. Key technical components include feed parsing engines for RSS/Atom formats, a search interface with keyboard-driven navigation, and an extensible architecture supporting third-party plugins. The tool addresses the workflow efficiency problem for developers and technical professionals who want unified feed reading within their primary development environment, eliminating context switching between applications while maintaining the customizability and keyboard-centric interaction model that Emacs users expect.
