`elfeed` is an Emacs Lisp application providing a fully-featured web feed reader. It enables users to subscribe to, read, and manage Atom and RSS feeds within the Emacs environment. Key functionalities include feed fetching, search filtering based on tags and criteria like age and regular expressions, and integration with Emacs features such as bookmarks and Org-mode. The project is a standalone application (plugin/extension) built primarily in Emacs Lisp, leveraging Emacs' text-editing capabilities, with optional integration with cURL for improved performance and external libraries like `libxml2` for HTML rendering. It is designed for Emacs users who want to read and manage web feeds directly within their text editor.
