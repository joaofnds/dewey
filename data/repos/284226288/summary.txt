This repository contains the source code for the official Org mode website (orgmode.org), implementing a modern redesign of the homepage using SCSS for styling without JavaScript bloat. It serves the documentation and web development domain by providing a static site generator approach using Org files as the content source, which are then converted to HTML with custom CSS styling. The project targets Emacs users, technical writers, and the broader Org mode community who rely on plain-text markup for documentation and task management. The repository solves the problem of maintaining an accessible, fast-loading website for Org mode documentation while preserving the tool's philosophy of simplicity and avoiding modern JavaScript frameworks, using only SCSS preprocessing for enhanced CSS development workflow.
