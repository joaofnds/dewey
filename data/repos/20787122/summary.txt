PostgREST is a Haskell-based HTTP server that automatically generates RESTful APIs from existing PostgreSQL database schemas, eliminating the need for manual API development. Built using the high-performance Warp web server and Hasql database library, it dynamically introspects PostgreSQL tables, views, and functions to create standards-compliant REST endpoints with full CRUD operations. The system leverages PostgreSQL's native capabilities for JSON serialization, data validation, and authorization through database roles, while supporting JWT-based authentication and OpenAPI documentation generation. Targeting backend developers and database administrators in web development, PostgREST addresses the common problem of building database-driven APIs by providing instant, maintainable REST interfaces that scale horizontally and delegate computation to the database layer for optimal performance.
