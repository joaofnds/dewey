PostgREST is a standalone server that transforms any existing PostgreSQL database into a RESTful API. Written in Haskell, it provides automatic API generation, supporting features like data validation, authorization via JWT, and schema-based versioning. It leverages the Hasql library for efficient database interaction, ensuring sub-second response times. The project is a standalone application primarily targeting backend developers who want to expose a database via a REST API without writing extensive custom code.
