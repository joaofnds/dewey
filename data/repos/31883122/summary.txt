Delta is a multi-system video game emulator for non-jailbroken iOS devices, built in Swift as the successor to GBA4iOS. It integrates mature C/C++ emulator cores (Nestopia for NES, Snes9x for SNES, mupen64plus for N64, Gambatte for Game Boy, visualboyadvance-m for GBA, melonDS for Nintendo DS, and Genesis Plus GX for Sega Genesis) to provide accurate emulation of classic gaming systems. The application targets mobile gaming enthusiasts and retro gaming communities, featuring native iOS UI, external controller support (PS4/PS5/Xbox), custom controller skins, save states, cloud sync via Google Drive/Dropbox, and cheat code support. Distributed through AltStore sideloading to bypass App Store restrictions, it solves the problem of playing classic console games on modern iOS devices without jailbreaking.
