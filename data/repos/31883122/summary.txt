Delta is an iOS application, written in Swift, designed as an all-in-one emulator for classic video game systems on non-jailbroken iOS devices. It provides a native UI for emulating NES, SNES, N64, GBC, GBA, DS, and Sega Genesis games, utilizing mature emulator cores. Key features include controller support (including custom skins and button mapping), save states, fast-forwarding, Delta Sync for cross-device game management, and cheat code support. The project is a standalone application built with modular architecture, incorporating submodules for individual emulator cores and leveraging the developer's private frameworks Roxas and Harmony.
