Dark Reader is an open-source browser extension built in TypeScript that automatically generates dark themes for web pages to reduce eye strain and improve accessibility. The extension analyzes DOM elements and CSS styles to dynamically invert colors, adjust brightness, and apply dark mode transformations across websites without requiring site-specific modifications. It supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Thunderbird through WebExtension APIs and provides a JavaScript API for programmatic integration. The project targets web developers, accessibility advocates, and end-users seeking enhanced browsing comfort, utilizing CSS manipulation, color theory algorithms, and browser extension frameworks to solve the universal problem of bright web interfaces in low-light environments.
