Hydra.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that implements custom modal interfaces and submodes for text editor workflows, inspired by Emacs Hydra. It enables developers and power users to create persistent keybinding contexts where a prefix key activates a mode allowing subsequent commands without re-pressing the prefix, streamlining repetitive operations like window resizing, buffer navigation, or git operations. The plugin provides a declarative API for defining "hydras" with configurable heads (key mappings), hints, colors, and exit behaviors, supporting features like custom menus, statusline integration, and timeout handling. It targets Neovim users seeking to optimize their editor efficiency through reduced keystrokes for frequently chained commands, particularly useful for window management, scrolling, version control workflows, and creating discoverable command palettes within the Neovim ecosystem.
