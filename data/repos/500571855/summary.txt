`hydra.nvim` is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that enables the creation of custom submodes and menus, emulating Emacs's Hydra functionality for enhanced keybinding organization and discoverability.  It allows users to define keybinding groups ("Hydras") where a prefix key activates a submode, providing access to multiple related commands without repeated prefix presses. The plugin features customizable hints, color-coded keybindings, and support for buffer-specific hydras, with options for handling foreign keys and timeouts.  It is a Neovim plugin and targets Neovim users seeking improved command execution and workflow efficiency.
