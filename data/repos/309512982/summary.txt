Redpanda is a high-performance streaming data platform written in C++ that provides Apache Kafka API compatibility for real-time data processing and event-driven architectures. Built on the Seastar framework, it eliminates dependencies on ZooKeeper and JVM while offering 10x performance improvements over traditional Kafka deployments. The platform targets DevOps engineers, platform developers, and data engineers working with microservices, stream processing, and real-time analytics. Key technologies include C++, Seastar async framework, Bazel build system, containerization support, and Kubernetes integration. Redpanda solves operational complexity and performance bottlenecks in distributed streaming systems by providing a simpler, faster alternative to Kafka clusters with built-in storage engine, tiered storage capabilities, and native container deployment for modern cloud-native environments.
