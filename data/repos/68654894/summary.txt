`dockfmt` is a command-line tool written in Go for formatting and parsing Dockerfiles. It functions as a code formatter analogous to `gofmt`, ensuring consistent style and structure for Dockerfile syntax. Key functionalities include formatting, diff generation to identify formatting changes, and inspection tools for extracting base image, maintainer, stage, and working directory information from Dockerfiles. This standalone application targets developers who write and maintain Dockerfiles, aiding in code readability and automated style enforcement for containerization projects.
