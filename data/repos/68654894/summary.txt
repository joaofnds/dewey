dockfmt is a command-line Dockerfile formatting and parsing tool written in Go, designed specifically for the DevOps and containerization domain. It functions as a code formatter for Dockerfiles, similar to how `gofmt` standardizes Go code formatting, targeting Docker developers and DevOps engineers who need consistent Dockerfile styling across projects. The tool provides comprehensive Dockerfile analysis capabilities including parsing, formatting with diff generation, and metadata extraction features such as base image inspection, maintainer information, multi-stage build analysis, and working directory enumeration. Beyond formatting, it serves as a static analysis utility for containerized application workflows, enabling teams to maintain standardized Docker build configurations and perform bulk analysis of Dockerfile collections for infrastructure auditing and compliance purposes.
