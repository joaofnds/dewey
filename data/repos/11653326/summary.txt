Tiny is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a domain-specific language for generating sequential numeric ranges and formatted text patterns within the Emacs text editor. It targets Emacs power users, developers, and technical writers who frequently need to create repetitive numbered sequences, formatted lists, or templated content. The package implements a concise syntax (e.g., `m10` for ranges, format specifiers like `%x` for hexadecimal) that expands into multi-line text with mathematical transformations, string formatting, and Lisp expression evaluation. It particularly excels in org-mode document generation, creating scheduled tasks, numbered headings, and URL sequences. The tool solves the inefficiency of using Emacs keyboard macros for repetitive text generation by providing better undo granularity, more compact syntax, and advanced formatting capabilities including number base conversions, mathematical operations, and date calculations.
