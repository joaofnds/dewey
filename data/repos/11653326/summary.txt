`tiny` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to quickly generate linear numerical ranges and insert them into text buffers. It provides an alternative to macro-based numeric range insertion, offering brevity, improved undo context, and the ability to transform numbers using `format`-style expressions and Lisp code. The core functionality includes generating sequences, formatting output, and integration with tools like `org-mode` to create dynamically generated content such as scheduled tasks and links. As an Emacs extension, `tiny` targets Emacs users and developers seeking enhanced text manipulation and automation within their editor environment.
