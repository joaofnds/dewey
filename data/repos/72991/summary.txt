`timecop` is a Ruby gem providing time manipulation capabilities specifically for testing time-dependent code. It enables "time travel", "time freezing", and "time acceleration" functionalities by mocking `Time.now`, `Date.today`, and `DateTime.now`. The core functionality is centered around simplifying the testing of code that relies on the system's time. This library is targeted towards Ruby developers using the Rails framework, enhancing their ability to create and maintain robust test suites.
