Timecop is a Ruby testing utility gem that provides time manipulation capabilities for testing time-dependent code in Ruby and Rails applications. It enables developers to freeze time at specific points, travel to different timestamps while allowing time progression, and scale time acceleration for integration testing scenarios. The gem mocks Ruby's core time methods (`Time.now`, `Date.today`, `DateTime.now`, `Process.clock_gettime`) through a unified API, supporting multiple input formats including Time instances, offsets, and individual date parameters. Designed for software testing workflows, it addresses the challenge of testing time-sensitive features like scheduled tasks, expiration logic, and time-based business rules. The gem targets Ruby developers and QA engineers working on web applications, particularly those using Rails frameworks, who need reliable and deterministic time-based testing without external dependencies.
