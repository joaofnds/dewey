SlimToolkit is a Go-based, standalone CLI application designed to optimize and secure container images, particularly within the cloud-native ecosystem. Its core function is to reduce container image size, potentially up to 30x, by inspecting, analyzing, and minifying container contents without requiring modifications to the original image. Key functionalities include image inspection (`xray`), Dockerfile linting, build optimization, debugging support, and automatic generation of security profiles (Seccomp, AppArmor). Users can leverage various commands for image analysis, including dynamic analysis through HTTP probing and the ability to build and run optimized container images. SlimToolkit targets developers building and deploying containerized applications, focusing on improving developer experience and enhancing container security.
