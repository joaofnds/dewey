SlimToolkit is a Go-based container optimization tool that reduces Docker container image sizes by up to 30x through static and dynamic analysis techniques. It targets DevOps engineers, containerization specialists, and application developers working with Docker containers across cloud-native environments. The toolkit performs container introspection, removes unnecessary components, and automatically generates security profiles (AppArmor, Seccomp) without requiring Dockerfile modifications or workflow changes. It supports multiple runtime environments including Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and others running on various Linux distributions. The tool addresses container bloat, security surface reduction, and compliance requirements in CI/CD pipelines by analyzing application behavior during execution and creating minimal, hardened container images while maintaining full application functionality.
