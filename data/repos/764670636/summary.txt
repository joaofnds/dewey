Grafana Alloy is an open-source distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector, designed for programmable pipelines and supporting metrics, logs, traces, and profiles. It offers a rich expression-based syntax for configuring powerful observability pipelines, integrates with multiple telemetry ecosystems such as OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Grafana Loki, and Grafana Pyroscope, and is Kubernetes-native. Alloy's programmable pipelines enable users to share and automate workload distribution across clusters, while its centralized configuration support allows for easy management. The technology stack primarily consists of Go, and it serves as a versatile tool for clustering and distributed observability in complex systems.
