Grafana Alloy is an open-source OpenTelemetry Collector distribution written in Go that provides programmable observability data pipelines for DevOps and platform engineering teams. It enables collection, processing, and routing of metrics, logs, traces, and profiles across heterogeneous monitoring ecosystems including Prometheus, Grafana Loki, and Grafana Pyroscope. The system features a declarative configuration syntax for building telemetry pipelines, supports Kubernetes-native operations, offers automatic workload distribution through clustering, and includes centralized configuration management. Alloy solves the complexity of observability data integration by providing a unified collector that can simultaneously handle multiple telemetry protocols and destinations, making it particularly valuable for system administrators and SREs managing multi-vendor monitoring infrastructures in cloud-native environments.
