`docker-sync` is a developer productivity tool written in Ruby designed to accelerate application development within Docker containers, specifically addressing file synchronization issues on macOS and Windows. Its core functionality provides significantly faster code syncing between the host operating system and Docker containers, enabling near real-time development workflows. The project leverages Docker and Docker Compose, and targets developers using Docker for local development, offering a command-line interface (CLI) to manage synchronized file access for various application types.
