Docker-sync is a Ruby-based development tool that solves Docker volume mounting performance issues on macOS, Windows, and Linux by implementing efficient file synchronization strategies between host systems and Docker containers. Targeting web developers and DevOps engineers using Docker for local development environments, it addresses the significant I/O performance bottlenecks that occur when bind-mounting source code directories into containers, particularly on non-Linux platforms where Docker runs in virtual machines. The tool integrates with docker-compose workflows and supports multiple synchronization backends (rsync, unison, native_osx) to maintain near-native filesystem performance while preserving real-time code synchronization. Docker-sync enables developers to maintain productive Docker-based development workflows without sacrificing application runtime performance, making containerized development environments viable for resource-intensive applications like web frameworks and build processes.
