Reticulum is a Phoenix-based web server written in Elixir that serves as the backend infrastructure for Mozilla Hubs, a social mixed reality platform. It functions as a hybrid game networking and web API server, handling real-time communication, user authentication, room management, and media streaming for virtual reality social experiences. The application uses PostgreSQL for data persistence, integrates with WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication, and provides REST APIs for client applications. Reticulum manages user sessions, room permissions, admin controls, and coordinates between multiple services including the Hubs client and Dialog voice chat system. It targets VR/AR developers and platform engineers building social virtual reality applications, providing the scalable server-side foundation necessary for multi-user immersive experiences with features like magic link authentication, room-based permissions, and real-time state synchronization.
