Ruby on Rails is a comprehensive web application framework built in Ruby that implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for developing database-backed web applications. The framework provides a complete technology stack including Active Record for object-relational mapping, Action Pack for HTTP request handling and routing, Action View for template rendering, and additional components like Active Job for background processing, Action Cable for WebSocket integration, and Action Mailer for email functionality. Rails targets web developers building server-side applications, providing convention-over-configuration principles and integrated tooling for rapid development of RESTful web services, APIs, and full-stack web applications across various industries requiring robust, scalable web solutions.
