tokyonight.nvim is a comprehensive Neovim color scheme and theming solution written in Lua, targeting developers and software engineers who use modern terminal-based development environments. The repository provides a dark/light theme system originally ported from Visual Studio Code's Tokyo Night theme, with native support for Neovim's LSP (Language Server Protocol), Tree-sitter syntax highlighting, and over 60 popular Neovim plugins including telescope, nvim-cmp, gitsigns, and lazy.nvim. Beyond Neovim, it extends theming consistency across the entire development toolchain by providing color schemes for terminal emulators (Alacritty, Kitty, iTerm2), shells (Fish), and various developer tools, solving the problem of fragmented visual consistency in modern Lua-based Neovim configurations and terminal workflows.
