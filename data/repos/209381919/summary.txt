roughViz is a JavaScript charting library that generates hand-drawn, sketchy-styled data visualizations for web browsers. Built on D3v5, roughjs, and handy frameworks, it provides seven chart types (bar, line, scatter, pie, donut, stacked bar, horizontal bar) with customizable "rough" aesthetic properties like fillStyle, roughness levels, and bowing effects. The library targets web developers and data scientists working on dashboards, presentations, or applications where approximate visual representation is preferred over precision. It supports multiple data input formats (CSV, TSV, JSON objects), offers CDN and npm distribution, and includes React, Vue, and Python wrappers. Primary use cases include prototyping, informal data presentations, and applications requiring non-corporate visual aesthetics in data visualization workflows.
