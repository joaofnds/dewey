Fullmoon is a minimalistic Lua web framework built specifically for Redbean, a single-file distributable web server based on the Cosmopolitan Libc project. Targeting web developers seeking lightweight deployment solutions, it provides essential web application components including HTTP routing with parameter extraction, template rendering, form validation, session management, and database integration within a single file. The framework leverages Redbean's cross-platform capabilities (Windows, Linux, macOS) and built-in SSL support to enable zero-dependency web application deployment. Fullmoon addresses the need for portable web services by combining Lua's simplicity with Redbean's unique single-executable distribution model, making it suitable for developers requiring minimal infrastructure overhead and maximum deployment portability for web applications and APIs.
