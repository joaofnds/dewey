Dressing.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that enhances the default `vim.ui.select` and `vim.ui.input` interfaces introduced in Neovim 0.6+. Targeting software developers and Neovim users in the text editor ecosystem, it provides improved UI components for common editor interactions like LSP renaming, file selection, and input prompts. The plugin integrates with popular Neovim ecosystem tools including Telescope, FZF, and NUI to offer multiple backend options for displaying selection menus and input dialogs. It maintains strict API compatibility with core Neovim while providing extensive customization through configuration rather than API extensions. The plugin addresses the limitation of Neovim's basic built-in UI components by offering more visually appealing and functional alternatives, though it's now archived in favor of the newer snacks.nvim plugin for similar functionality.
