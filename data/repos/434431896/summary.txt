`dressing.nvim` is a Neovim plugin designed to enhance the default `vim.ui` interfaces for input and selection. Written in Lua, it provides customizable implementations for `vim.ui.input` and `vim.ui.select`, allowing users to tailor the appearance and behavior of these core Neovim UI elements, with options for integration with plugins like Telescope, fzf, and Nui. The plugin enables customization through a configuration function and supports features such as border styling, input history, and mappings.  This developer productivity tool facilitates improved user experience by providing alternative, configurable UI components within the Neovim environment.
