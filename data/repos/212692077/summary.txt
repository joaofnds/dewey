This GitHub Action provides automated vulnerability scanning for container images, file systems, and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files within CI/CD pipelines. Built on JavaScript and leveraging Anchore's Grype scanner, it targets DevOps and security teams implementing secure software supply chain practices. The action scans Linux distributions (Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu) and language-specific packages (NPM, Python wheels, Ruby gems, Java JARs, Go modules) for known vulnerabilities, with configurable severity thresholds (low, medium, high, critical) that can fail builds based on security policy requirements. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions workflows, Docker builds, and SBOM generation tools, enabling shift-left security practices by identifying threats before deployment without requiring external credentials or data transmission.
