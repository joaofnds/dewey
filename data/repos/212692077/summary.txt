`anchore/scan-action` is a GitHub Action designed for container and file vulnerability scanning, built to integrate into CI/CD pipelines. It leverages the Grype scanner, providing automated vulnerability detection within container images, file paths, and SBOM files. This JavaScript-based action supports a variety of package and library ecosystems, including Linux distributions, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Java, and generates reports in formats like SARIF, JSON, and CycloneDX. Users can configure build failure based on vulnerability severity and specify a custom Grype version. The project is a developer productivity tool specifically targeted at software engineers and DevOps professionals working to ensure the security of containerized applications and software builds within GitHub Actions workflows.
