This repository implements a JavaScript-based visualization of the boids flocking algorithm, a computational model that simulates emergent group behavior through three core rules: coherence (steering toward nearby boids), separation (avoiding collisions), and alignment (matching velocity vectors). Built for web browsers using vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas rendering, it provides an interactive educational demonstration with adjustable parameters including visual range and behavior factors. The simulation targets computer science educators, algorithm enthusiasts, and web developers interested in emergent systems and computational biology concepts. Users can modify the boids.js file to experiment with flocking parameters, add predator-prey dynamics, or extend the 2D system to 3D, making it suitable for learning artificial life algorithms and collective behavior modeling in browser-based environments.
