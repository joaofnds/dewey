This JavaScript repository demonstrates the Boids algorithm, simulating the flocking behavior of birds. The core functionality involves simulating boid movement governed by rules of coherence, separation, and alignment, adjustable via user-controlled parameters like centeringFactor and avoidFactor. The project, which is a standalone web application, provides a visual simulation that runs in a web browser by directly opening the `index.html` file, leveraging JavaScript for its implementation, and allowing users to experiment with and modify the algorithm's behavior in the `boids.js` file.
