Frangipanni is a Go-based command-line text processing utility that converts flat line-based input into hierarchical tree structures by tokenizing text based on configurable delimiters. Primarily targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators, it transforms outputs from common Unix tools like `find`, log files, and file paths into readable tree visualizations or structured JSON. The tool implements configurable tokenization with options for custom break characters, folding optimization for single-branch paths, depth control, and sorting mechanisms. It supports multiple output formats including indented text trees and JSON, with extensibility through Lua scripting for custom formatting. The utility solves the common problem of making hierarchical relationships visible in flat text data, particularly useful for analyzing filesystem structures, log entries, and nested configuration data in Unix/Linux environments.
