Hotpot.nvim is a Fennel-to-Lua compiler plugin for Neovim that enables seamless integration of Fennel (a Lisp dialect) code within Neovim configurations and plugins. Targeting Neovim plugin developers and configuration enthusiasts, it automatically compiles Fennel source files from `fnl/` directories into Lua bytecode on-demand when required, providing transparent caching and dependency management. The plugin solves the friction of using functional Lisp syntax in the Lua-based Neovim ecosystem by handling compilation, module resolution, and file watching behind the scenes. It supports both runtime compilation and ahead-of-time building, allowing developers to write Neovim configurations and plugins in Fennel's expressive syntax while maintaining compatibility with Neovim's Lua runtime and existing plugin managers like Lazy.nvim.
