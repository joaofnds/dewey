`hotpot.nvim` is a Neovim plugin facilitating the use of the Fennel programming language. It functions as a compiler plugin, automatically compiling Fennel code within Neovim on demand, allowing users to directly require and utilize `.fnl` files in their Lua configuration. The plugin integrates with Neovim's diagnostic capabilities, displaying Fennel compilation errors, and provides commands and API functions for evaluating and compiling Fennel code, including support for operator-pending mode. This project is a plugin/extension designed for Neovim users who want to leverage the features of Fennel within their editor environment.
