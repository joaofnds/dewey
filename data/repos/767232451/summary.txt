**pprint** is a Gleam library that provides enhanced pretty-printing functionality for debugging and testing workflows. Built specifically for the Gleam programming language ecosystem, it formats complex data structures like lists, tuples, and Result types with proper indentation, syntax highlighting, and color output to improve code readability during development. The library addresses the common developer pain point of inspecting nested data structures in terminal environments by offering a more visually appealing alternative to standard print functions. Primarily targeted at Gleam developers working on debugging, testing, and development tooling, pprint integrates seamlessly into existing Gleam projects as a development dependency, enhancing the developer experience when working with functional programming constructs and pattern matching scenarios typical in Gleam applications.
