ESLint is a JavaScript-based static code analysis tool (linter) designed to identify and report on patterns and potential problems within ECMAScript/JavaScript code. Functionality includes identifying stylistic issues, detecting potential errors, and enforcing coding standards through configurable rules. As a JavaScript plugin-based project, it uses Espree for parsing and an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for code evaluation, providing a highly customizable and extensible framework for code quality analysis. It is a developer productivity tool, and a CLI application, targeting JavaScript developers seeking to maintain code quality and consistency.
