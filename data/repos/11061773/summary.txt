ESLint is a static code analysis tool for JavaScript and ECMAScript development that identifies and reports code quality issues, syntax errors, and coding standard violations. Built for web developers and JavaScript engineers, it uses the Espree parser to generate Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for pattern evaluation across JavaScript codebases. The tool features a completely pluggable architecture where every rule functions as an independent plugin, enabling runtime extensibility and custom rule creation. ESLint integrates into modern web development workflows through Node.js environments, supporting JSX syntax and various JavaScript module systems. It addresses code consistency, maintainability, and error prevention in frontend, backend, and full-stack JavaScript applications through configurable linting rules and automated code quality enforcement.
