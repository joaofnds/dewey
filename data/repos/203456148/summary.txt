BunkerWeb is an open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF) built on NGINX that provides security-by-default protection for web applications and services. Targeting the cybersecurity and DevSecOps domains, it integrates with containerized and orchestrated environments including Docker, Kubernetes, and Docker Swarm, as well as traditional Linux deployments. The system combines core security features like anti-bot protection, DNS blacklisting, ModSecurity integration, and reverse proxy capabilities with an extensible plugin architecture for custom security modules. Written primarily in Python, BunkerWeb addresses the complexity of web application security hardening by offering automated SSL/TLS certificate management via Let's Encrypt, configurable security rules, and a web-based management interface. It serves DevOps engineers, system administrators, and security professionals who need to implement comprehensive web application protection without extensive manual security configuration across diverse deployment environments.
