Vertico is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a vertical completion interface for the GNU Emacs text editor, targeting Emacs users and developers who work extensively within the Emacs ecosystem. It replaces Emacs' default horizontal completion UI with a performant vertical display system that integrates seamlessly with Emacs' built-in completion framework, including minibuffer commands, file navigation, and buffer switching. The package implements features like arrow key navigation, candidate filtering, history-based sorting, and support for completion styles like Orderless, while maintaining full compatibility with existing Emacs completion tables and commands. Vertico solves the problem of inefficient completion workflows in Emacs by offering a more intuitive and visually organized interface for command execution, file selection, and symbol lookup, primarily serving Emacs power users, Lisp developers, and anyone seeking to optimize their Emacs-based development environment.
