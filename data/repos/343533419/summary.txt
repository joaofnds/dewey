Lip Gloss is a Go library for styling terminal user interfaces (TUIs) and command-line applications, providing CSS-like declarative styling capabilities for terminal text rendering. Built for the CLI/TUI development domain, it enables developers to create visually formatted terminal layouts with comprehensive color support (ANSI 4-bit, 8-bit, 24-bit true color), text formatting (bold, italic, underline), block-level styling (padding, margins, borders), text alignment, and responsive color adaptation for light/dark terminal backgrounds. The library addresses the problem of creating aesthetically pleasing terminal applications by abstracting ANSI escape sequence complexity behind an intuitive API. It targets Go developers building CLI tools, terminal dashboards, and interactive console applications who need professional-looking text layouts without manually handling terminal color codes and formatting sequences.
