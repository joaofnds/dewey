`lipgloss` is a Go library designed for defining and rendering styled text and layouts within terminal user interfaces (TUIs). It provides a declarative approach to styling, similar to CSS, offering features such as ANSI color support (including 16, 256, and true color profiles), inline and block-level formatting, text alignment, borders, and table/list rendering utilities. As a developer productivity tool, it enables Go developers to create visually appealing and customizable CLI applications.
