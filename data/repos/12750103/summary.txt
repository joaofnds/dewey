HTTPoison is an HTTP client library for Elixir applications, built as a wrapper around the Erlang hackney HTTP client to provide idiomatic Elixir interfaces for web service communication. Targeting Elixir/Phoenix web developers and backend engineers, it enables REST API consumption, microservice communication, and external service integration within the Erlang/OTP ecosystem. The library provides synchronous HTTP operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with pattern matching support on response structs, SSL/TLS configuration options, timeout controls, and extensible base modules for building custom API clients. It addresses the need for reliable HTTP client functionality in functional programming environments, offering both simple one-off requests and structured API wrapper development through HTTPoison.Base, making it essential infrastructure for Elixir applications requiring external HTTP communication.
