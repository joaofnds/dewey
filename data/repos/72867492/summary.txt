This repository provides a web-based educational demonstration of blockchain technology concepts, specifically targeting cryptocurrency and distributed ledger understanding. Built as a Node.js web application using Pug templating and Express framework, it offers interactive visualizations of blockchain fundamentals including hash functions, proof-of-work mining, and immutable ledger mechanics. The demo implements configurable mining difficulty through SHA-256 hashing with adjustable zero-prefix requirements, allowing users to experiment with nonce generation and understand computational complexity scaling in blockchain networks. Designed for educators, students, and developers seeking to grasp Bitcoin and blockchain technology principles through hands-on interaction, it serves as a pedagogical tool for demonstrating cryptographic concepts, block validation, and the relationship between mining difficulty and computational time in distributed systems.
