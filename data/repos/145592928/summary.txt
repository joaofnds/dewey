clj-github-app is a Clojure library that enables developers to build GitHub Apps by providing essential authentication and webhook handling capabilities for GitHub's REST API integration. Targeting web developers and DevOps engineers working with GitHub automation, the library solves the complex challenge of GitHub App authentication workflows, including JWT-based app authentication, installation access token management with caching, and secure webhook payload signature verification using HMAC-SHA256. Built on clj-http for HTTP client functionality and crypto-equality for secure comparisons, it abstracts away the intricate token lifecycle management and provides a clean API for both app-level and installation-level GitHub API requests. The library is particularly valuable for developers building CI/CD tools, repository automation, code analysis services, or any application requiring programmatic GitHub integration with proper security practices.
