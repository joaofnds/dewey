docopt is a Python library that generates command-line argument parsers from human-readable docstrings, targeting software developers and DevOps engineers building CLI applications. Instead of programmatically defining parsers using traditional libraries like argparse or optparse, docopt reverses the approach by parsing usage patterns and option descriptions directly from help message text written in a standardized format. The library automatically handles argument validation, option parsing, and help message generation based on docstring specifications that include usage patterns, positional arguments, optional flags, and default values. This declarative approach eliminates boilerplate parser code and ensures consistency between documentation and actual CLI behavior, making it particularly valuable for Python developers creating command-line tools, system administration scripts, and automation utilities where clear, maintainable argument parsing is essential.
