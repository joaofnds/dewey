`primerpython` is an archived Python library designed to facilitate the creation of 3D animations and visual effects within Blender for educational videos. It provides high-level functions for building and animating Blender objects, leveraging the `Bobject` class for object manipulation and keyframing. The library utilizes Blender 2.79 and requires the Script Runner addon, with dependencies including TeX, `dvisvgm`, and potentially OpenBabel for molecular visualization, reflecting its integration with Blender's Python API. It functions primarily as a library used within the Blender environment via the Script Runner addon to create and control animations and visual elements.
