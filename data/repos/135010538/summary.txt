This repository contains a Python-based animation library for creating educational videos using Blender 2.79 as the rendering engine. Built for the Primer Learning YouTube channel, it provides high-level abstractions around Blender's API to programmatically generate and animate mathematical visualizations, molecular structures, and educational content. The framework centers around "Bobject" (Blender Object) classes that simplify 3D object manipulation and keyframe animation within Blender scenes. It integrates with TeX for mathematical notation rendering, OpenBabel for molecular visualization, and uses the Script Runner addon for interactive development. The codebase draws architectural inspiration from manim (3Blue1Brown's animation engine) and targets educational content creators and technical educators who need to produce animated explanations of complex mathematical, scientific, or programming concepts through procedural 3D animation rather than manual video editing.
