`organice` is a JavaScript-based progressive web app (PWA) providing an implementation of Org mode, designed for mobile and desktop browsers. It replicates the functionality of Emacs' Org mode without the need for Emacs itself, focusing on features related to productivity and project management. Built for browser environments, this standalone web application enables users to create, edit, and manage Org mode files directly within their web browser, targeting users who need Org mode features but don't want to or cannot use Emacs.
