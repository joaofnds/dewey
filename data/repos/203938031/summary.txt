organice is a JavaScript-based web application that implements Org mode functionality without requiring Emacs, targeting productivity and project management workflows in web browsers. Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), it provides mobile and desktop browser access to Org mode file editing and synchronization through cloud storage providers like Dropbox, GitLab, and WebDAV. The application serves productivity-focused users who need mobile access to their Org mode documents for task management, note-taking, and project organization while maintaining compatibility with the Emacs Org mode format. It operates as a client-side application without backend dependencies, enabling users to edit structured text documents, manage TODO lists, and organize information using the established Org mode syntax and conventions across devices.
