rack-mini-profiler is a Ruby middleware library for performance profiling of Rack-based web applications, targeting Ruby web developers working with Rails and other Rack frameworks. It provides real-time performance monitoring through speed badges on HTML pages, database query profiling for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MongoDB, call-stack flamegraphs using StackProf, and memory usage analysis with garbage collection statistics. The tool instruments SQL queries, HTTP requests via Net::HTTP, and Rails components through ActiveSupport::Notifications, designed for both development and production environments. It addresses the critical need for identifying performance bottlenecks in Ruby web applications by providing detailed timing, memory allocation, and database query analysis directly within the browser interface.
