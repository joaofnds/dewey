`rack-mini-profiler` is a Ruby middleware library designed for profiling the performance of Rack-based web applications in both development and production environments. It provides a speed badge that displays timing information for each HTML page, complemented by optional features including database profiling (supporting multiple database systems), call-stack profiling with flame graphs, and memory profiling to analyze per-request resource usage. This library is intended to be integrated into existing Ruby on Rails and Rack applications via simple gem installation and configuration, offering detailed performance insights for developers to identify and optimize application bottlenecks.  It's targeted at developers, specifically Ruby web developers, who need a tool to analyze and improve the performance of their web applications.
