Neogit is a Git interface plugin for Neovim written in Lua, designed to provide an interactive and powerful version control workflow within the editor. Inspired by Emacs' Magit, it targets software developers and DevOps engineers who prefer terminal-based development environments and want seamless Git integration without leaving their editor. The plugin offers comprehensive Git operations including staging, committing, branching, rebasing, and diff visualization through a structured status buffer interface. It integrates with popular Neovim ecosystem tools like Telescope, diffview.nvim, and fzf-lua for enhanced functionality. Neogit solves the context-switching problem between editor and command-line Git operations by providing a unified, keyboard-driven interface that maintains the efficiency of terminal workflows while offering visual feedback and interactive features for complex Git operations like interactive rebasing and merge conflict resolution.
