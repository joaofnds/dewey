Neogit is a Neovim plugin providing an interactive Git interface, inspired by Magit, offering a comprehensive set of Git operations directly within the editor. Written in Lua, it enables users to perform actions such as staging, committing, pushing, pulling, rebasing, merging, and managing branches and tags. The plugin integrates with external tools like `diffview.nvim` and `telescope.nvim` for enhanced functionality and utilizes a flexible configuration system with support for custom keymaps, highlight groups, and integrations. Designed for developers, it streamlines Git workflows within the Neovim environment.
