Resque is a Ruby library for asynchronous job processing that leverages Redis as a persistent queue backend to handle background tasks in web applications. Designed for Ruby and Rails developers, it provides a three-component architecture: a Ruby API for job creation and management, Rake tasks for worker processes, and a Sinatra-based web interface for monitoring. The system addresses the common web development problem of offloading time-intensive operations (file processing, email sending, data imports) from HTTP request cycles to background workers, enabling better application responsiveness and scalability. Jobs are defined as Ruby classes with a `perform` method and stored as JSON in Redis queues, allowing for distributed processing across multiple machines with built-in failure handling and queue prioritization capabilities.
