`direnv` is a standalone application and shell extension written in Go, designed to manage environment variables based on the current directory. It automatically loads and unloads environment variables defined in `.envrc` files within project directories, facilitating per-project isolation and management of secrets. Supporting various shells (bash, zsh, tcsh, fish, etc.), it provides a set of utility functions within the `.envrc` context for common tasks like path manipulation, making it a developer productivity tool. The project's architecture consists of a statically compiled executable interacting with the user's shell.
