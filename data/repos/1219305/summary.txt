direnv is a shell extension written in Go that provides automatic, directory-based environment variable management for Unix-like systems. It monitors for `.envrc` files in the current and parent directories, executing them in a bash sub-shell to load project-specific environment variables when entering a directory and automatically unloading them when exiting. The tool integrates with major shells (bash, zsh, fish, tcsh) through hooks and includes a standard library of utility functions for common environment manipulation tasks. Targeting software developers and DevOps engineers, direnv solves the problem of managing per-project configuration, secrets, and development environments without cluttering global shell profiles, making it particularly useful for 12-factor applications, isolated development environments, and deployment workflows across multiple programming languages and frameworks.
