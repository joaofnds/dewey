request.el is an HTTP client library for Emacs Lisp that provides a comprehensive interface for making HTTP requests within the Emacs editor environment. Targeting Emacs developers and automation scripters, it uses curl as the primary backend with fallback to Emacs's native url.el library. The library supports all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), authentication mechanisms, file uploads, JSON data handling, XML parsing, and Unix domain sockets. It features both synchronous and asynchronous request modes with rich callback systems for success, error, and status code handling. The primary use cases include integrating web APIs into Emacs workflows, building Emacs packages that require HTTP communication, and automating web-based tasks directly from the editor, making it essential for developers creating web-enabled Emacs applications and extensions.
