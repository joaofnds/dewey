GraalVM is a high-performance JDK distribution focused on compiling Java applications into native executables for improved startup time, resource efficiency, and peak performance. It functions as a compiler and runtime environment, enabling ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation through its Native Image component. The project encompasses a compiler, language implementation framework (Truffle), and various language engines including JavaScript, Python, and WebAssembly, implemented in Java. This is a framework/SDK project, targeting Java developers and language implementers, allowing them to build and run applications on a platform optimized for modern cloud-native and serverless workloads.
