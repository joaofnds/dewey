GraalVM is a high-performance Java Development Kit (JDK) distribution that provides ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation capabilities for Java applications, targeting enterprise software development and polyglot runtime environments. The repository implements a complete compiler infrastructure including the Graal compiler written in Java, SubstrateVM for native image generation, and the Truffle language implementation framework. It supports multiple programming languages (Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, R, WebAssembly) running on a unified runtime, enabling developers to build native executables with faster startup times and reduced memory footprint. The system addresses performance bottlenecks in cloud-native and microservices architectures where traditional JVM warmup overhead is problematic, primarily serving backend developers, DevOps engineers, and enterprise software architects working with containerized applications and serverless computing environments.
