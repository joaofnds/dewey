Tone.js is a TypeScript-based Web Audio API framework designed for creating interactive music applications in web browsers. It provides a comprehensive audio programming toolkit for web developers and audio programmers, offering high-level Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) features including global transport synchronization, event scheduling, prebuilt synthesizers, and audio effects. The framework abstracts Web Audio API complexities through familiar musical concepts like tempo-relative timing notation, ADSR envelopes, and oscillator-based synthesis. It enables sample-accurate audio scheduling, supports both NPM installation and CDN distribution, and provides building blocks for custom synthesizers and effects processing. Tone.js addresses the challenge of creating professional-quality music applications in JavaScript environments, targeting developers building interactive music software, educational audio tools, games with dynamic soundtracks, and browser-based music production applications that require precise audio timing and synthesis capabilities.
