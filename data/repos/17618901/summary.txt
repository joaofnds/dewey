Tone.js is a TypeScript Web Audio framework designed for interactive music creation within web browsers. This library provides a comprehensive set of tools, including synths (FM, AM, etc.), samplers, effects, and a transport for scheduling and synchronizing audio events, facilitating the development of digital audio workstations (DAWs) in the browser. Key functionalities encompass sample-accurate scheduling, time encoding abstractions, signal manipulation, and MIDI integration for complex audio synthesis and manipulation. As a library, it offers a modular architecture built upon Web Audio API primitives, targeting web developers and musicians building web-based audio applications.
