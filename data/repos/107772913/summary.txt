This repository is a curated directory of production-grade application software built with Common Lisp, serving as a comprehensive resource for developers and researchers interested in functional programming applications across diverse domains. It catalogs real-world Common Lisp implementations spanning audio/music composition software (OpenMusic, OpusModus), development tools and IDEs, desktop environments, text editors, web applications, games, and system utilities. The collection targets Common Lisp developers, computer music researchers, and software architects evaluating Lisp for application development, demonstrating the language's practical viability beyond academic contexts. By organizing applications by category and maintaining both curated and complete lists, it addresses the common perception that Common Lisp lacks substantial end-user applications, providing concrete evidence of its use in commercial and open-source software across multiple industries including music technology, education, and system administration.
