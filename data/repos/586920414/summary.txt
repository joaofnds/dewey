**mise** is a comprehensive development environment management tool built in Rust that serves as a unified replacement for multiple developer utilities. It functions as a language version manager (like asdf, nvm, or pyenv) supporting hundreds of development tools including Node.js, Python, Terraform, and Go; an environment variable manager (like direnv) for project-specific configurations; and a task runner (like make) for build and deployment workflows. The tool targets software developers and DevOps engineers working across polyglot environments who need consistent toolchain management across projects. mise uses TOML configuration files to declaratively define tool versions, environment variables, and task definitions, enabling reproducible development environments and streamlined project onboarding while eliminating the need for multiple separate tools.
