`mise` is a developer tool written in Rust that streamlines the management of development tools, environment variables, and project tasks. Functionally similar to tools like `asdf`, `direnv`, and `make`, it allows users to install and switch between multiple versions of development tools (e.g., Node.js, Python, Terraform), configure project-specific environment variables, and define custom tasks for common build and test operations within project directories. This standalone CLI application targets software developers seeking to improve their development workflow through tool versioning, environment management, and task automation.
