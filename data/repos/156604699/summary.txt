`prettier.el` is an Emacs package that integrates the Prettier code formatter, enabling automated code formatting for JavaScript files and other supported languages within the Emacs editor. It operates by running Prettier in a long-running Node.js process to minimize overhead, providing features such as on-save formatting, integration with `tramp-mode` for remote file editing, and synchronization of Prettier configuration settings into the Emacs buffer. This plugin provides a more efficient alternative to the official `prettier-emacs` package by addressing Node.js startup overhead and maintaining buffer position during formatting, targeting Emacs users and JavaScript developers seeking to automate their code style.
