prettier.el is an Emacs package that integrates Prettier code formatting into the Emacs text editor for web development workflows. It runs Prettier in a persistent Node.js process to minimize startup overhead, automatically formatting JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML, and other web code on file save or on-demand. The package supports remote file editing via tramp-mode, includes major mode integrations, and synchronizes Prettier configuration settings with Emacs buffer settings like indentation. Written in Emacs Lisp with JavaScript components, it targets web developers using Emacs who need consistent code formatting across projects. The tool solves the friction of manual code formatting by providing seamless, low-latency integration between Prettier's formatting capabilities and Emacs' editing environment, supporting both local and remote development scenarios.
