Aerial is a macOS screensaver application built in Swift that replicates Apple TV's aerial video screensaver functionality for Mac computers. The software targets desktop customization and media display domains, specifically serving Mac users who want cinematic aerial footage as their screensaver content. It leverages macOS screensaver frameworks to display high-quality aerial videos of locations like New York, San Francisco, and Hawaii, while integrating OpenWeather API for real-time weather overlays and forecasts. The application supports multilingual video descriptions through community translations and includes native Apple Silicon compilation. Designed for end-users rather than developers, it addresses the demand for premium screensaver experiences on Mac systems running macOS 10.12 or later, providing an open-source alternative to proprietary screensaver solutions with enhanced features like location-based weather integration.
