CMAK (Cluster Manager for Apache Kafka) is a Scala-based web application designed for managing and monitoring Apache Kafka clusters in big data environments. Built using the Play Framework, it provides system administrators and DevOps engineers with a comprehensive GUI for cluster operations including topic management, partition reassignment, consumer offset monitoring, broker inspection, and preferred replica election. The tool integrates with ZooKeeper for cluster state management and supports JMX polling for real-time metrics collection across multiple Kafka versions (0.8.x through 0.11.x). CMAK addresses the operational complexity of managing distributed Kafka deployments by centralizing administrative tasks like partition distribution analysis, topic configuration, and cluster health monitoring into a single web interface, eliminating the need for command-line tools and manual cluster management procedures.
