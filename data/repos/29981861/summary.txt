CMAK is a Scala-based standalone application designed for managing Apache Kafka clusters. It provides a web interface for monitoring and administering Kafka, enabling users to manage multiple clusters, inspect cluster state (topics, consumers, offsets), perform preferred replica elections, and manage partition assignments and reassignments. The application features topic creation/deletion, configuration updates, and consumer offset management, leveraging Scala and incorporating features for authentication via LDAP. Its architecture is centered around interacting with Kafka clusters and uses JMX polling for metrics collection. It is a developer productivity tool for system administrators and Kafka users.
