Grafana Tempo is an open-source distributed tracing backend written in Go, designed for DevOps and site reliability engineering teams managing microservices architectures. It provides high-volume trace ingestion and storage using object storage backends (S3, GCS, Azure) with support for multiple tracing protocols including OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Zipkin, and OpenCensus. The system implements TraceQL, a traces-first query language for analyzing distributed system performance, and integrates with the Grafana observability stack alongside Prometheus and Loki. Tempo addresses the core problem of tracking request flows across distributed services to identify performance bottlenecks, latency issues, and errors in complex microservices environments, targeting platform engineers, SREs, and developers responsible for monitoring and troubleshooting distributed applications at scale.
