Grafana Tempo is a high-volume, minimal-dependency distributed tracing backend written in Go, designed for cost-effective storage and analysis of trace data. Its core function is to facilitate the identification and resolution of performance issues by providing a scalable solution for ingesting, storing, and querying traces from various sources, including Jaeger, Zipkin, and OpenTelemetry. Tempo integrates deeply with Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki, offering a Traces Drilldown UI for intuitive trace analysis, and supports TraceQL, a query language inspired by LogQL and PromQL for targeted trace queries. It operates as a standalone application with CLI utility and integrates with object storage solutions such as Azure, GCS, and S3. It provides a distributed tracing solution for operations teams, SREs, and developers.
