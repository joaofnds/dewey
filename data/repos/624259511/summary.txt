Mako is a high-performance web bundler written in Rust that targets modern JavaScript/TypeScript development workflows. It serves the web development domain by providing an alternative to traditional Node.js-based bundlers like Webpack, focusing on build speed optimization through Rust's performance characteristics. The project integrates with popular React and Node.js ecosystems, supporting TypeScript compilation, tree shaking, and module federation. Mako addresses the common pain point of slow build times in large-scale web applications by leveraging Rust's compiled performance while maintaining compatibility with existing JavaScript toolchains. It's primarily designed for frontend developers and build engineers working on production web applications, particularly those using the Umi framework ecosystem, Ant Design, and similar React-based projects requiring fast, reliable bundling for development and production builds.
