CRI-O is a Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) implementation, written in Go, designed to integrate Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant runtimes with the Kubernetes Kubelet. Its core functionality centers around managing container lifecycles, image formats, and resource isolation, supporting OCI runtimes like runc. This project enables Kubernetes to directly launch and manage OCI containers, leveraging tools such as containers/image and containers/storage for image management and storage, as well as CNI for networking. CRI-O is primarily a daemon-based system component targeted at system administrators and Kubernetes platform engineers, providing the runtime layer for containerized applications within a Kubernetes cluster.
