CRI-O is a lightweight, OCI-compliant container runtime implementation of the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI), designed specifically for Kubernetes environments. Built in Go, it serves as an alternative to Docker for running containers in Kubernetes clusters by integrating OCI runtimes like runc and crun with the kubelet. The project targets DevOps engineers, platform operators, and Kubernetes administrators who need a minimal, secure container runtime focused solely on Kubernetes workloads. CRI-O eliminates Docker's overhead by providing only essential container lifecycle management, image handling, and pod networking capabilities required by Kubernetes, while maintaining compatibility with OCI standards and supporting advanced features like Kata Containers for enhanced security isolation.
