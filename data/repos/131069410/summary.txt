This Ruby application implements a Slack bot that automatically triggers typing indicators in response to other users' typing activity within Slack channels. The program monitors Slack's real-time messaging API for typing events and responds by initiating its own typing indicator, creating a synchronized typing behavior across participants. Built for the workplace communication and team collaboration domain, it serves as a humorous automation tool for Slack workspaces. The application likely utilizes Slack's WebSocket-based RTM (Real Time Messaging) API and Ruby HTTP libraries to interface with Slack's platform infrastructure. This tool targets developers, Slack workspace administrators, or team members seeking to add playful automation to their communication workflows, demonstrating practical API integration and real-time event handling in enterprise messaging platforms.
