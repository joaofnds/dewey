`command-log-mode` is an Emacs Lisp package that provides real-time logging and visualization of editor commands and events within Emacs buffers. Designed for Emacs power users, developers, and those creating screencasts or tutorials, it captures user interactions including keystrokes, function calls, and buffer operations, displaying them in a dedicated log buffer. The package implements both local minor-mode and global minor-mode functionality, allowing selective or comprehensive command tracking across editing sessions. Originally forked from `mwe-log-commands.el`, it serves the developer tooling and editor customization domain by enabling workflow analysis, debugging of Emacs configurations, demonstration purposes, and learning complex key bindings. This introspection tool is particularly valuable for Emacs users seeking to understand their editing patterns or document their workflows.
