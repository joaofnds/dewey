`goquery` is a Go library providing an HTML parsing and manipulation API with a syntax inspired by jQuery. Built upon Go's `net/html` package and the CSS selector library `cascadia`, it enables users to parse HTML documents, select elements using CSS selectors, and modify the document structure. Key functionalities include HTML parsing, element selection, and DOM manipulation via a chainable interface, similar to jQuery. It is a library, specifically a developer productivity tool, intended for Go developers who need to parse and interact with HTML documents, such as web scraping or HTML data extraction tasks.
