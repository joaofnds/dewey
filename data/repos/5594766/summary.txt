goquery is a Go library for server-side HTML parsing and manipulation that brings jQuery-like syntax and functionality to Go applications. Built on top of Go's net/html package and the cascadia CSS selector library, it enables developers to traverse, filter, and extract data from HTML documents using familiar jQuery-style selectors and method chaining. The library is primarily targeted at web developers and backend engineers working on web scraping, HTML processing, server-side rendering, and data extraction tasks. It requires UTF-8 encoded HTML input and focuses on DOM querying and traversal rather than stateful DOM manipulation, making it ideal for parsing web content, building web scrapers, processing HTML templates, and extracting structured data from web pages in Go-based applications and microservices.
