Husky is a lightweight JavaScript-based Git hooks automation tool designed for web development workflows and DevOps practices. It simplifies the implementation of client-side Git hooks by leveraging Git's native `core.hooksPath` feature, enabling developers to automatically execute scripts during Git operations like commits, pushes, and merges. The tool integrates seamlessly with Node.js projects through npm's `prepare` script lifecycle, supporting all 13 Git client-side hooks across macOS, Linux, and Windows environments. Husky addresses the common problem of enforcing code quality gates, running linters, tests, or formatting tools before commits, making it essential for maintaining consistent code standards in JavaScript/Node.js projects, monorepos, and CI/CD pipelines targeting frontend and backend developers.
