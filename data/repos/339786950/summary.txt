Encore is an open-source backend development framework for building type-safe distributed systems and microservices, targeting backend developers working with Go and TypeScript. It provides declarative infrastructure-as-code capabilities, allowing developers to define services, databases, APIs, cron jobs, and pub/sub systems directly in application code without separate infrastructure configuration like Terraform. The platform includes a local development CLI with automatic infrastructure management, tracing, and architecture visualization, plus cloud deployment automation for AWS and GCP. Encore addresses the complexity of modern cloud-native application development by abstracting infrastructure semantics from cloud-specific configurations, enabling portable applications across environments while maintaining type safety and reducing boilerplate code for distributed systems architecture.
