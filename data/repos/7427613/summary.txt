This repository contains a comprehensive community-driven coding style guide for the Clojure programming language, authored by bbatsov and maintained as an AsciiDoc document. It provides standardized formatting conventions, naming guidelines, code organization principles, and best practices specifically for Clojure developers working on functional programming projects. The guide covers Lisp-specific syntax styling, semantic indentation rules, function definition patterns, and macro usage conventions to ensure code readability and maintainability across Clojure codebases. Targeted at professional Clojure programmers, software development teams, and open-source contributors, it addresses the critical need for consistent code formatting in functional programming environments where Clojure is used for web development, data processing, and enterprise applications. The guide reflects real-world Clojure usage patterns rather than theoretical ideals, making it practically applicable for production codebases.
