Pandoc is a universal markup converter written in Haskell that transforms documents between over 40 different markup formats including Markdown, HTML, LaTeX, DocBook, EPUB, Word docx, and reStructuredText. It serves the publishing, documentation, and academic writing domains by providing a command-line tool and Haskell library for automated document format conversion. The tool addresses the critical problem of document portability across different publishing workflows, allowing technical writers, researchers, and documentation teams to maintain content in one format while outputting to multiple target formats. Pandoc uses an intermediate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation to enable high-fidelity conversions and supports extensibility through Lua filters and custom readers/writers for specialized markup processing workflows.
