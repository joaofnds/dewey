This repository demonstrates a secure infrastructure-as-code pipeline that integrates HashiCorp Terraform with HashiCorp Vault for managing ephemeral AWS credentials. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform teams, it implements a GitHub Actions workflow that dynamically retrieves short-lived cloud provider credentials from Vault using AppRole authentication, eliminating the need to store long-term AWS access keys in CI/CD systems. The pipeline deploys a PostgreSQL RDS instance on AWS using Terraform 0.14+, with Vault 1.5+ managing secrets through HashiCorp Cloud Platform's managed service. This approach addresses the critical security challenge of credential management in automated infrastructure deployments by implementing the principle of least privilege and temporal access controls for cloud resources.
