This repository provides an example infrastructure pipeline for provisioning a PostgreSQL database on Amazon Web Services using HashiCorp Terraform. It leverages HashiCorp Vault for secure secrets management, retrieving credentials to interact with the cloud provider. The pipeline is designed to run within a GitHub Actions workflow and showcases the integration of Terraform with Vault, utilizing features from Terraform 0.14+, Vault 1.5+, and optionally HashiCorp Cloud Platform Vault. This example project serves as a template and educational resource for infrastructure-as-code practitioners.
