Rye is a package and project management solution for Python, written in Rust, designed to streamline Python development. It provides a unified environment for managing Python installations, `pyproject.toml`-based projects, dependencies, and virtual environments. Key features include bootstrapping Python environments, integrating tools like `ruff` for linting and formatting, managing virtual environments, building wheels, publishing packages using `twine`, and dependency locking using `uv` (or `unearth` and `pip-tools` as a fallback). This is a command-line application (CLI) and a developer productivity tool that aims to simplify the Python development workflow.
