Rye is a comprehensive Python project and package management tool written in Rust that provides a unified workflow for Python developers across all experience levels. It addresses the fragmented Python tooling ecosystem by integrating Python installation management, virtualenv handling, dependency resolution, linting/formatting (via ruff), and package publishing into a single command-line interface. The tool manages pyproject.toml-based projects, supports complex monorepos and workspaces, and bootstraps Python installations using Indygreg's standalone builds. Rye leverages established Python tools like virtualenv, pip-tools, twine, and uv under the hood while providing a streamlined developer experience. It targets Python developers working on everything from simple scripts to enterprise applications, eliminating the need to juggle multiple package managers and environment tools.
