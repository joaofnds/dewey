OPAL is a Python-based open-source project that provides a real-time administration layer for policy engines such as Open Policy Agent (OPA) and AWS' Cedar Agent. It facilitates the distribution and synchronization of policy and data updates to policy agents within microservices and cloud-native architectures, ensuring services are always in sync with authorization requirements. Core functionalities include real-time policy and data updates via a lightweight WebSocket-based PubSub channel, supporting fine-grained authorization and integration with various data sources. As a server and client application, OPAL enables developers to manage and automate policy deployments and streamline permissions across microservices.
