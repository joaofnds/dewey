OPAL (Open Policy Administration Layer) is a real-time policy synchronization system for distributed authorization architectures, primarily targeting DevOps and cloud-native microservices environments. Built in Python with WebSocket-based pub/sub messaging, it manages live updates of authorization policies and data to policy engines like Open Policy Agent (OPA), AWS Cedar Agent, and OpenFGA. The system uses a client-server architecture where OPAL servers detect changes in policy sources (Git, databases, APIs) and push updates to OPAL clients, which then synchronize their local policy engines. It addresses the critical problem of maintaining consistent, up-to-date authorization state across distributed systems where policy decisions depend on rapidly changing application data, enabling fine-grained access control in microservice architectures for platform engineers and security teams.
