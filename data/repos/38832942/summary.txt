This repository is a curated collection of command-line interface (CLI) applications organized by functional categories including development tools, data manipulation utilities, system administration, entertainment, and productivity software. Targeting developers, system administrators, and power users who prefer terminal-based workflows, it catalogs CLI tools across domains like DevOps (Docker, database management), web development (HTTP clients/servers, npm tools), data processing (JSON/YAML processors, text manipulation), version control (Git utilities), file management, and system utilities. The collection emphasizes cross-platform terminal applications that replace GUI tools, supporting workflows in Unix-like environments and modern development practices. It serves as a comprehensive reference for discovering specialized command-line tools that enhance productivity in software development, system administration, and technical operations.
