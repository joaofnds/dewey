Hercules is a Git repository analysis engine written in Go that performs advanced software repository mining and code analytics. Built on go-git, it processes entire Git commit histories through a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of analysis tasks to extract insights like code burndown patterns, developer contributions, file coupling relationships, code ownership metrics, and churn analysis. The tool targets software engineering teams, DevOps professionals, and engineering managers who need quantitative insights into codebase evolution, developer productivity, and technical debt patterns. It features a plugin architecture for custom analyses, integrates with TensorBoard for machine learning visualizations, supports multi-repository organizational analysis, and includes Python visualization components via the companion "labours" tool. The system addresses software repository mining challenges by providing fast, scalable analysis of Git histories for data-driven engineering decision making.
