nvim-solarized-lua is a Neovim colorscheme plugin that implements the popular Solarized color palette in pure Lua for Neovim 0.5+. Targeting software developers and text editor users, it provides a complete port of vim-solarized8 with native support for modern Neovim features including LSP (Language Server Protocol), Treesitter syntax highlighting, and popular plugins like Telescope, FZF, and lualine. The plugin offers four contrast variants (normal, high, flat, low) with customizable options for italics, visibility levels, diff highlighting, and terminal transparency. It includes 8-bit color support for broader accessibility and integrates with development tools commonly used in software engineering workflows, solving the need for consistent, eye-friendly syntax highlighting across modern Neovim development environments.
