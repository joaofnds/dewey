Paperview is a high-performance, standalone C application designed to set animated wallpapers on Linux systems using the X11 windowing system. It utilizes SDL2 for rendering animated BMP image sequences, supporting single and multi-monitor configurations through command-line arguments specifying animation folders, playback speed, and display geometry. The application allows users to run animated wallpapers as a background daemon and includes utilities for creating custom scenes from GIF files using imagemagick, while also providing instructions for integrating random wallpaper selection at startup. This CLI-based project targets users seeking to customize their Linux desktop environment with animated backgrounds.
