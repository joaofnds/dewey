Paperview is a high-performance animated wallpaper setter for Linux desktop environments using X11 window system. Built in C with SDL2 graphics library, it renders BMP image sequences as animated desktop backgrounds by writing directly to the X11 root window. The application supports multi-monitor configurations through dynamic parameter specification for screen geometry (X, Y, width, height coordinates) and offers configurable frame rates. It addresses the need for animated desktop customization on Linux systems while maintaining low resource usage (2.3% CPU, 11.7% GPU on integrated Intel graphics). Target users include Linux desktop enthusiasts, system customizers, and power users who want animated wallpapers without the overhead of traditional desktop background applications or compositors that may conflict with X11 rendering.
