This Ruby gem provides comprehensive CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas) and CNPJ (Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa Jurídica) number utilities for Brazilian web applications and development workflows. It offers validation, formatting, and generation capabilities for these mandatory Brazilian tax identification numbers through both programmatic Ruby APIs and command-line interfaces. The library supports strict validation modes, handles the new alphanumeric CNPJ algorithm (effective July 2026), and provides consistent APIs for both document types with methods for formatting (xxx.xxx.xxx-xx pattern), stripping non-numeric characters, and generating random valid numbers. Targeting Ruby developers building Brazilian e-commerce, fintech, or government integration applications, it solves the common pain point of handling Brazilian fiscal document validation and formatting in web applications, form processing, and automated systems that interact with Brazilian banking and government services.
