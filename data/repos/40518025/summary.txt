This monorepo provides a comprehensive GraphQL development ecosystem centered around GraphiQL, the reference implementation of a browser-based GraphQL IDE. Built with TypeScript and React, it delivers a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation, editor integrations for CodeMirror and Monaco, and a complete language service for GraphQL schema introspection, syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error detection. The project targets web developers and GraphQL API creators who need robust tooling for writing, testing, and debugging GraphQL queries and schemas. It solves the problem of limited GraphQL development experience by providing standardized language support across multiple editors and IDEs, enabling features like intelligent code completion, real-time validation, and interactive query execution directly in development environments.
