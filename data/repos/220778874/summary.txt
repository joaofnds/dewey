BLAKE3 is a high-performance cryptographic hash function implementation providing official Rust and C libraries with extensive SIMD optimizations (SSE2, SSE4.1, AVX2, AVX-512, NEON). Built on Merkle tree architecture, it delivers parallelizable hashing across multiple threads and SIMD lanes while supporting verified streaming, incremental updates, and multiple cryptographic modes (PRF, MAC, KDF, XOF). The repository targets cryptography developers, security engineers, and systems programmers requiring fast, secure hashing for applications like file integrity verification, digital signatures, and key derivation. It includes the `b3sum` command-line utility, optimized runtime CPU feature detection, multithreading support via Rayon, and reference implementations for porting to other languages, solving performance bottlenecks in cryptographic operations compared to SHA-2/SHA-3.
