The `BLAKE3` repository provides official Rust and C implementations of the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function. BLAKE3 is a fast, secure, and parallelizable hash function offering functionalities like PRF, MAC, KDF, and XOF. It includes Rust crates (with SSE2, SSE4.1, AVX2, AVX-512, NEON, and WASM optimizations) for library usage and a command-line utility (`b3sum`), alongside a C implementation and a reference implementation for educational purposes. This project is a library and command-line utility intended for developers and system integrators requiring a high-performance cryptographic hashing solution.
