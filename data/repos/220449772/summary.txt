`openwifi` is an open-source project providing a full-stack IEEE 802.11/Wi-Fi design based on Software Defined Radio (SDR), targeting the embedded systems and software-defined radio domains. The project offers a Linux driver and software alongside an FPGA design (in a separate repository), enabling 802.11a/g/n functionality with features like CSMA/CA implementation, 802.11 packet injection, CSI analysis, and configurable channel access parameters. Primarily written in C, `openwifi` leverages FPGA hardware, with Verilog as a design language, and integrates with the Linux mac80211 framework; it supports various SDR platforms like Xilinx Zynq boards and Analog Devices' FMCOMMS series. This is a project for researchers and engineers looking to implement and experiment with custom Wi-Fi solutions.
