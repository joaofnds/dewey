OpenWiFi is an open-source IEEE 802.11 WiFi baseband implementation designed for Software Defined Radio (SDR) platforms, targeting wireless communications researchers, RF engineers, and SDR developers. Built with C drivers, Verilog FPGA designs, and Linux mac80211 integration, it provides a complete WiFi stack running on Xilinx Zynq FPGAs paired with Analog Devices AD9361 transceivers. The system implements 802.11a/g/n protocols with CSMA/CA MAC layer, OFDM modulation, and real-time packet processing at 20MHz bandwidth across 70MHz-6GHz frequency range. It enables advanced WiFi research applications including packet injection, channel state information (CSI) analysis, custom MAC protocols, and radar functionality, solving the problem of closed-source WiFi chipsets that limit protocol experimentation and wireless security research.
