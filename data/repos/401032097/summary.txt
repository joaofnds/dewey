lemmeknow is a high-performance pattern identification tool written in Rust that analyzes mysterious text strings and identifies their types using regex pattern matching. Primarily targeting cybersecurity professionals, malware analysts, and forensic investigators, it can identify cryptographic hashes, encoded strings, URLs, and other data patterns commonly found in network packets, malware samples, and security artifacts. The tool offers both a CLI interface and a Rust crate API, with WebAssembly support for web integration. Benchmarks show it's 33x faster than the Python-based PyWhat for large files and 3x faster for single strings, making it particularly valuable for real-time threat analysis and digital forensics workflows where rapid pattern identification is critical.
