SOAR (SQL Optimizer And Rewriter) is a command-line database optimization tool developed by Xiaomi for automated SQL query analysis and improvement. Built in Go, it specifically targets MySQL protocol databases, providing heuristic-based query optimization, multi-column index recommendations for complex CRUD operations, and automated SQL rewriting based on customizable rules. The tool offers EXPLAIN plan analysis, SQL fingerprinting, query compression and formatting, ALTER statement merging, and syntax auditing capabilities. Designed for database administrators, backend developers, and DevOps engineers working with MySQL databases, SOAR addresses performance bottlenecks by analyzing query patterns and suggesting structural improvements without requiring deep database optimization expertise, making it particularly valuable for teams managing large-scale MySQL deployments.
