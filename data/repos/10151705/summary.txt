ESUP (Emacs Start Up Profiler) is a performance profiling tool written in Emacs Lisp that analyzes and benchmarks Emacs editor startup times from within the Emacs environment itself. Targeting Emacs power users and developers in the text editor customization domain, it provides detailed performance metrics to identify bottlenecks in Emacs initialization files and configuration scripts. The tool profiles user-init-file execution by default but supports custom file profiling through prefix arguments, presenting results in an interactive buffer with timing data for each configuration component. Compatible with GNU Emacs 25.1+, ESUP integrates with popular Emacs package managers including MELPA, Cask, El-Get, and use-package, making it accessible to developers who heavily customize their Emacs workflows and need to optimize editor startup performance for improved productivity.
