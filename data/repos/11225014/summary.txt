etcd is a distributed key-value database designed for storing critical configuration data and metadata in distributed systems and cloud-native infrastructure. Built in Go and implementing the Raft consensus algorithm, it provides strongly consistent data storage across multiple nodes with automatic leader election and fault tolerance. The system exposes a gRPC API for client operations and serves as the primary datastore for Kubernetes cluster state, service discovery, and distributed coordination. Target users include DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and distributed systems developers who need reliable shared configuration storage, leader election, and distributed locking primitives. etcd operates on standard ports 2379 (client) and 2380 (peer communication) and is widely adopted in container orchestration platforms and microservices architectures requiring consistent metadata storage.
