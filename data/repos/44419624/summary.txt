Absinthe is a comprehensive GraphQL server implementation for Elixir that enables developers to build type-safe, performant APIs using GraphQL specification standards. The toolkit provides compile-time schema validation, asynchronous and batched field resolution, configurable query processing pipelines, and complexity analysis for production-grade GraphQL services. It integrates with Phoenix and Plug frameworks for web development, supports frontend clients like Relay and Apollo, and offers extensible resolution plugins to address N+1 query problems. Targeted at Elixir developers building modern web APIs and microservices, Absinthe translates between Elixir's snake_case conventions and GraphQL's camelCase standards while providing advanced features like precompiled documents, custom validation logic, and robust error handling for enterprise-level GraphQL implementations.
