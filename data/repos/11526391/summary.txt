rewrite-clj is a Clojure library that provides programmatic manipulation of Clojure, ClojureScript, and EDN (Extensible Data Notation) source code while preserving whitespace, comments, and formatting. Targeting the Clojure development ecosystem, it serves as a foundational tool for code analysis, transformation, and refactoring applications. The library enables developers to build sophisticated code manipulation tools including formatters (cljfmt, cljstyle), linters (splint), language servers (clojure-lsp), refactoring utilities, and dependency management tools. It operates by parsing source code into a rewriteable AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) that maintains structural fidelity to the original text. Primary users include Clojure/ClojureScript developers building developer tooling, IDE extensions, automated refactoring systems, and code analysis platforms within the broader Clojure development toolchain.
