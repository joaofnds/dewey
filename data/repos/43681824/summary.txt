This GitHub repository contains the source code for Varnish Cache, a high-performance HTTP reverse proxy and caching solution primarily used in web development. It solves the problem of optimizing server response times by caching frequently accessed resources, reducing the load on origin servers and improving overall system performance.

Key features include granular control over cache behavior, support for various HTTP methods, and advanced request handling capabilities such as URL rewriting, header manipulation, and gzip compression. The technology stack includes C programming language, with a focus on efficient memory management and low-level network operations.

As an application, Varnish Cache is designed to be deployed as a standalone server or integrated into existing web infrastructures for clustering and load balancing purposes. It caters to users seeking high-performance caching solutions, particularly those managing heavy traffic websites or applications.
