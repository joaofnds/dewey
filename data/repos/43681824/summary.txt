Varnish Cache is a high-performance HTTP reverse proxy and web accelerator implemented in C, designed to dramatically improve website performance by caching HTTP responses in memory. It sits between web servers and clients, intercepting HTTP requests and serving cached content when available, reducing backend server load and response times. The system targets web infrastructure and DevOps domains, specifically addressing performance bottlenecks in high-traffic web applications and content delivery scenarios. Varnish uses a sophisticated caching engine with configurable policies, supports ESI (Edge Side Includes), and provides extensive logging and monitoring capabilities. Primary users include system administrators, DevOps engineers, and web architects managing large-scale web infrastructures who need to optimize HTTP traffic delivery and reduce server resource consumption through intelligent caching strategies.
