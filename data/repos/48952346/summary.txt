Buttercup Browser Extension is a TypeScript-based password management browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave that provides automated login credential filling and management capabilities. The extension integrates with the Buttercup desktop password manager application (v2.26+) through secured local requests to access encrypted password vaults stored on platforms like Dropbox and Google Drive. It utilizes the Locust library for automatic form and input detection, enabling users to auto-fill login credentials, save new passwords, and enter OTP codes. The extension targets end-users seeking secure password automation in web browsers, communicating with the desktop application via local API calls to retrieve and store encrypted credential data while maintaining security through vault-based architecture.
