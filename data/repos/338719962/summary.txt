Spotube is a cross-platform music streaming client built with Flutter/Dart that provides an open-source alternative to proprietary music applications. The application targets mobile (Android) and desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) by combining music metadata from various APIs with audio streaming from YouTube, Piped.video, or JioSaavn to deliver ad-free music playback. Originally designed to interface with Spotify's API for playlist and user data access, the project has been legally compelled to discontinue Spotify integration and is transitioning to operate independently of proprietary music platform APIs. The client serves music enthusiasts and privacy-conscious users seeking a native, cross-platform music player with features like offline downloads, synchronized lyrics, and anonymous usage without telemetry collection.
