ClojureScript is a compiler that transpiles Clojure functional programming language code to JavaScript, targeting web development and JavaScript ecosystem integration. Built in Clojure, it generates JavaScript compatible with Google Closure Compiler's advanced optimization mode, enabling dead code elimination and aggressive minification. The compiler allows developers to leverage Clojure's immutable data structures, macros, and functional programming paradigms while producing efficient JavaScript for browsers and Node.js environments. It addresses the challenge of building complex web applications with functional programming benefits while maintaining JavaScript interoperability and performance. Primary users are Clojure developers seeking to build frontend web applications, SPAs, and JavaScript libraries using familiar Lisp syntax and functional programming concepts rather than traditional JavaScript development approaches.
