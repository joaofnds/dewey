sqlx is a Go library that extends the standard `database/sql` package with enhanced data mapping and query capabilities for backend and web development. It provides seamless struct marshaling, named parameter support, and convenient `Get`/`Select` methods that automatically map database rows to Go structs, slices, and maps. The library maintains full compatibility with existing `database/sql` code while adding features like embedded struct support, batch insertions, and improved prepared statement handling. Targeting Go backend developers working with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite), sqlx eliminates boilerplate code for common ORM-like operations without being a full ORM, making it ideal for developers who want more ergonomic database interactions while retaining direct SQL control and performance.
