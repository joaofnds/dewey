`commercial-emacs/commercial-emacs` is a fork of GNU Emacs, developed in Emacs Lisp, aiming to enhance the original editor. It features improvements such as performant long lines without narrowing, tree-sitter font highlighting, a rewritten non-blocking Gnus implementation, and a rewritten process management system. Notably, it includes experimental work towards a generational, moving garbage collector. This project appears to be a standalone Emacs editor distribution and potentially a developer productivity tool targeted towards Emacs users seeking performance and feature enhancements beyond the standard GNU Emacs.
