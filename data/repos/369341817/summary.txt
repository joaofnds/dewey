`dirvish` is an Emacs Lisp project providing an enhanced file manager built upon the `dired` interface. This software delivers a "polished" user experience within the Emacs environment, effectively acting as an advanced file browsing and manipulation tool. It extends the core functionality of `dired`, indicated by the "batteries included" description, suggesting integrated features beyond the base Emacs file manager, ultimately functioning as an extension or enhancement for Emacs users.
