Dirvish is an Emacs Lisp package that enhances Emacs' built-in Dired file manager with modern UI improvements and extended functionality. Targeting Emacs users and developers who rely on text-based workflows, it transforms the traditional directory editor into a feature-rich file management interface with visual enhancements, customizable layouts, and additional navigation capabilities. The package integrates with Emacs' existing Dired infrastructure while adding ranger-inspired features, transient-based command menus, and modular extensions. It addresses the need for improved file management within the Emacs ecosystem, providing both aesthetic improvements and functional enhancements for developers, system administrators, and power users who prefer staying within their Emacs environment for file operations rather than switching to external file managers.
