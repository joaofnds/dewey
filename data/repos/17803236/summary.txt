Rclone is a command-line cloud storage synchronization tool written in Go that provides rsync-like functionality for cloud storage providers. It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and power users who need to sync, copy, and manage files across diverse cloud storage backends including Amazon S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, Azure Blob Storage, Backblaze B2, and 70+ other providers. The tool implements unified APIs for different storage protocols (S3, WebDAV, FTP, SFTP, Swift), supports encryption, mount operations via FUSE filesystem integration, and handles complex cloud storage operations like bandwidth limiting, checksumming, and incremental transfers. Rclone solves the problem of vendor lock-in and provides consistent tooling for cloud storage management, backup automation, and data migration workflows across heterogeneous cloud infrastructure environments.
