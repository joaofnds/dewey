This repository contains the open-source CMS powering changelog.com, a developer podcasting platform built with Elixir and the Phoenix web framework. The application uses PostgreSQL for data persistence, Node.js for static asset compilation, and serves as a specialized content management system for hosting and distributing developer-focused podcasts. While specifically tailored to Changelog's requirements with hardcoded podcast configurations, it demonstrates a production-ready Phoenix application architecture for web developers learning Elixir/Phoenix patterns. The platform handles podcast episode management, community features, and content delivery for the developer podcast ecosystem, targeting web developers interested in functional programming, Phoenix framework implementation, and podcast content management systems.
