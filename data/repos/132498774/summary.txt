This repository, `vmware-archive/tgik`, is the official resource for "TGI Kubernetes" (TGIK), a monthly live video stream focused on Kubernetes. It serves as an archive and index, providing access to past episodes through a playlist and linking to the official YouTube channel. The project facilitates community engagement by allowing users to suggest episode topics via the issue tracker. Primarily a content repository, it is designed for Kubernetes practitioners seeking educational resources and community-driven content.
