This repository serves as the official resource hub for TGI Kubernetes (TGIK), a monthly live streaming educational series focused on Kubernetes technologies and cloud-native DevOps practices. Targeting DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and Kubernetes practitioners, the repository maintains episode indexes, show notes, and community-driven content suggestions for the video series. Built primarily with Shell scripting for automation and repository management, it addresses the need for continuous Kubernetes education and knowledge sharing within the cloud-native ecosystem. The repository facilitates community engagement through GitHub issue tracking for episode suggestions and serves as a centralized reference point for accessing TGIK content via YouTube, supporting the broader Kubernetes learning community with practical demonstrations and technical deep-dives.
