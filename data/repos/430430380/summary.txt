This repository serves as a comprehensive educational resource for Go developers learning concurrent programming patterns and synchronization primitives. It provides practical code examples demonstrating core Go concurrency concepts including goroutines, channels, mutexes, race condition prevention, deadlock avoidance, and advanced patterns like fan-in/fan-out, pipelines, and context-based cancellation. The guide covers essential sync package primitives (Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroup, Cond, Pool) and channel-based communication patterns, addressing common concurrency challenges such as data races, livelocks, and starvation. Built upon examples from authoritative Go concurrency literature, this resource targets intermediate to advanced Go developers working on concurrent systems, distributed applications, or high-performance backend services who need to master Go's CSP-based concurrency model and synchronization mechanisms for building robust, scalable applications.
