This Go repository provides a practical guide and examples for concurrent programming in Go, focusing on communication via channels and various concurrency patterns. It covers crucial topics like race conditions, memory synchronization using mutexes, wait groups, read-write mutexes, and condition variables, along with in-depth explanations of deadlock, livelock, and starvation scenarios. Key features include demonstrations of channel usage, and design patterns such as confinement, cancellation, and pipelines. The project is structured as a series of code examples, tutorials, and references, making it an educational resource for Go developers learning and applying concurrent programming principles.
