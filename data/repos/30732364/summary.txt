Falcor is a JavaScript library for efficient data fetching developed by Netflix that implements a virtual JSON graph model to optimize client-server data communication in web applications. It allows frontend developers to treat remote data as a single JSON object while automatically batching, caching, and deduplicating requests behind the scenes. The library uses a Router-based architecture with Express.js middleware integration to create virtual JSON resources that can aggregate data from multiple backend services and datastores. Falcor addresses the over-fetching and under-fetching problems common in REST APIs by enabling clients to request exactly the data they need using path-based queries, making it particularly valuable for complex web applications with multiple data dependencies and real-time requirements.
