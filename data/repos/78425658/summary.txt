cl-str is a modern Common Lisp string manipulation library designed to provide a consistent, discoverable API for string operations in Common Lisp applications. Built on cl-ppcre for regex functionality, it addresses the verbosity and inconsistencies of Common Lisp's built-in string functions by offering simplified methods like `str:trim` instead of complex `string-trim` calls, and consistent argument ordering where strings are always the last parameter to enable function composition and threading. The library provides comprehensive string operations including trimming, splitting, joining, case conversion, padding, substring extraction, file I/O, and predicates for string validation. It targets Common Lisp developers across domains who need reliable string processing capabilities, offering integration with Quicklisp and Ultralisp package managers for easy adoption in existing Lisp codebases and applications.
