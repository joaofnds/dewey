`cl-str` is a Common Lisp library providing a modern, simple, and consistent set of string manipulation functions. It offers a wide range of capabilities, including whitespace trimming, string joining and concatenation, substring extraction, case conversion, and search/replace functionality, including regular expression support. The library builds upon the `cl-ppcre` dependency for regular expression operations, aiming for discoverability and composability through consistent argument ordering. This project functions as a developer productivity tool, offering an alternative and more user-friendly interface to string operations compared to the standard Common Lisp built-ins, and is designed for Common Lisp developers.
