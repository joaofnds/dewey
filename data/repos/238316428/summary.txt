This repository serves as the primary data repository for COVID-19 pandemic tracking, operated by Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE). It provides structured epidemiological datasets including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across global geographic regions, supporting the widely-used JHU COVID-19 dashboard built on ESRI ArcGIS platform. The repository aggregates data from multiple health organizations (WHO, CDC, ECDC) and regional health departments, formatting it into time-series CSV files for data analysis and visualization applications. Primary users include epidemiologists, public health researchers, data scientists, and developers building COVID-19 tracking applications. The data follows standardized geographic hierarchies (country/province/county levels) and temporal formats, enabling integration with statistical analysis tools, GIS systems, and web-based dashboards. As of March 2023, data collection has ceased with users redirected to official health organization sources.
