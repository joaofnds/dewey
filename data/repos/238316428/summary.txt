The `CSSEGISandData/COVID-19` repository houses a comprehensive dataset and associated resources related to the COVID-19 pandemic, initially curated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). This project serves as a data repository, providing global and U.S. COVID-19 case, death, and vaccine data, along with links to various data sources, including WHO and CDC. Key functionalities include data collection, aggregation, and visualization, exemplified by the interactive web-based dashboards (desktop and mobile) that present the COVID-19 data. While the repository itself doesn't explicitly state a primary programming language, the project is associated with data visualization and analysis, suggesting the use of relevant technologies for data processing and presentation. This is a research artifact/dataset focused on providing public health information.
