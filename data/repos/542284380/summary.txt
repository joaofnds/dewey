Bruno is an open-source API client and testing IDE built with JavaScript that serves as a lightweight alternative to Postman and Insomnia for web developers and API engineers. The application targets the API development and testing domain, supporting REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, and OpenAPI specifications while enabling HTTP request construction, response analysis, and automated testing workflows. Bruno's distinctive architecture stores API collections as plain text files using a custom markup language (Bru) directly on the filesystem, enabling Git-based version control and team collaboration without cloud dependencies. The cross-platform desktop application addresses API exploration, testing, and documentation needs for development teams requiring offline-first tooling with integrated version control capabilities for managing API request collections and test suites.
