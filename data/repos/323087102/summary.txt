`sx` is a fast, modern, and easy-to-use command-line network scanner written in Go. Designed for information security and penetration testing, it provides a suite of network scanning capabilities, including ARP, ICMP, TCP (SYN, FIN, NULL, Xmas, custom flags), and UDP scans, along with application-specific scans for SOCKS5 proxies, Docker daemons, and Elasticsearch nodes. It features JSON output, supports live scanning, utilizes an ARP cache for performance, and offers rate limiting. This standalone application targets network administrators, security professionals, and penetration testers for network reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment tasks.
