**sx** is a high-performance command-line network scanner written in Go, designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and network administrators. It implements multiple network reconnaissance techniques including ARP scanning for local network discovery, ICMP host detection, TCP SYN/FIN/NULL/Xmas scans for port enumeration, and UDP scanning with full ICMP response analysis. The tool supports advanced features like custom TCP flag manipulation, SOCKS5 proxy detection, Docker daemon discovery, and Elasticsearch node identification. Built on libpcap for raw packet manipulation, sx emphasizes speed (claiming 30x faster than nmap), UNIX philosophy compliance, and structured JSON output for automated processing. It uses randomized IP iteration through finite cyclic multiplicative groups and supports both Ethernet and VPN interfaces, targeting the information security and network reconnaissance domain.
