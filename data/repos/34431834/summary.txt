XMake is a cross-platform build utility and package manager built in Lua, designed for C/C++ developers and systems programmers working on native application development. It serves as a comprehensive build system that combines the functionality of Make/Ninja for compilation, CMake/Meson for project generation, and Vcpkg/Conan for dependency management into a unified tool. The system supports extensive cross-compilation across Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and embedded platforms, with compatibility for major toolchains including GCC, Clang, MSVC, and specialized compilers for CUDA, Rust, Swift, and assembly languages. XMake addresses the complexity of modern C/C++ project builds by providing simple Lua-based configuration files, automatic dependency resolution, and integrated package management, targeting developers who need efficient, portable build workflows for native software projects across multiple platforms and architectures.
