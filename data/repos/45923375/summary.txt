**dry** is a terminal-based Docker management application written in Go that provides a comprehensive TUI (Terminal User Interface) for Docker and Docker Swarm administration. Targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators, it offers real-time monitoring and management capabilities for Docker containers, images, networks, volumes, and Swarm constructs (nodes, services, stacks) through keyboard-driven navigation. The application interfaces with both local and remote Docker daemons via the Docker API, providing equivalent functionality to the official Docker CLI while adding enhanced visualization and interactive management features. It serves as both an operational tool for container lifecycle management and a monitoring solution for Docker infrastructure, distributed as a standalone binary without external dependencies.
