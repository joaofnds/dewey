`dry` is a terminal-based Docker and Docker Swarm management application written in Go. It provides real-time monitoring and management capabilities for Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes, mimicking core Docker CLI commands while offering enhanced interactive features. Key functionalities include listing, inspecting, and managing Docker resources, including support for Swarm-specific constructs like nodes, services, and stacks. This standalone CLI application is built upon libraries such as `tcell` and `termui` to create a user-friendly terminal interface for Docker administration, targeted toward system administrators and developers.
