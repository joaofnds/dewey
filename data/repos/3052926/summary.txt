vim-eunuch is a Vim plugin written in Vim Script that provides enhanced file system operation commands for UNIX-based development environments. It bridges the gap between Vim's buffer management and shell file operations by offering commands like `:Remove`, `:Delete`, `:Move`, `:Chmod`, and `:SudoEdit` that synchronize file system changes with Vim's internal buffer state. The plugin targets software developers and system administrators working in UNIX/Linux environments who need seamless integration between their text editor and file system operations. It solves common workflow friction points such as deleting files without buffer errors, renaming files while preserving buffer state, editing privileged files with sudo, and automatically setting executable permissions on shell scripts, making it particularly valuable for DevOps engineers and developers working with system configuration files.
