Textual is a Python framework enabling the creation of cross-platform terminal and web-based user interfaces. It provides a declarative API for building applications with widgets (buttons, tables, etc.) and a layout system, supporting both terminal and web browser rendering. Key features include a command palette, a built-in development console, and integration with asynchronous Python libraries. Textual applications are easily served on the web using a built-in server, and are targeted towards Python developers building TUI (Text User Interface) and web applications.
