Textual is a Python framework for building Terminal User Interface (TUI) applications that can run both in terminal environments and web browsers. Targeting CLI tool developers, DevOps engineers, and Python developers who need cross-platform interface solutions, it provides an asynchronous event-driven architecture with CSS-like styling, pre-built widgets (buttons, data tables, tree controls, text areas), and flexible layout systems. Built on Python's async capabilities and integrating with the Rich library ecosystem, Textual addresses the need for sophisticated terminal-based applications with modern UI paradigms, offering features like command palettes, development consoles, and web serving capabilities via `textual serve`, enabling deployment of terminal apps as web applications without code changes.
