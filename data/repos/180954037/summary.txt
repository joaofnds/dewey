gojq is a pure Go implementation of the jq command-line JSON processor, targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and backend developers who need reliable JSON manipulation capabilities. Built entirely in Go without C dependencies, it provides a portable alternative to the original C-based jq for parsing, filtering, and transforming JSON data in shell scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and data processing workflows. The implementation offers enhanced error messaging, arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, YAML input/output support, and can be embedded as a library in Go applications. It addresses the deployment complexity and cross-platform compatibility issues of the original jq while maintaining query language compatibility, making it particularly valuable for containerized environments and distributed systems where dependency management and portability are critical concerns.
