`gojq` is a pure Go implementation of the `jq` command-line JSON processor, providing a portable alternative to the original C-based implementation. This project is a standalone command-line utility and a library enabling Go developers to parse and transform JSON data using the `jq` query language within their Go applications. Key features include support for a wide range of `jq` functionalities, improved error messages, and arbitrary-precision integer calculations, addressing limitations in the original `jq`. Its technology stack centers on the Go programming language, allowing cross-platform compatibility, and it provides a programmatic interface for integration within Go projects.
