Briefer is a collaborative business intelligence platform that combines Jupyter-style notebooks with interactive dashboards for data analysis and reporting. Built primarily in TypeScript, it targets data analysts, data scientists, and business intelligence professionals who need to create, share, and schedule data-driven reports. The platform integrates with major databases including PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Redshift, and MySQL, supporting Python and SQL code execution alongside native visualizations and Markdown documentation. It addresses the fragmentation between exploratory data analysis tools and dashboard creation by providing real-time collaboration, AI-powered code generation, scheduled execution, and interactive data applications with form inputs and filters, all deployable via Docker or pip installation.
