rs/zerolog is a high-performance JSON logging library for Go applications, designed for backend systems, microservices, and production environments where structured logging is critical. It implements zero-allocation JSON log output through a fluent chaining API that avoids reflection and memory allocations, targeting DevOps engineers, backend developers, and system administrators who need efficient structured logging. The library supports standard logging features including leveled logging (trace through panic), contextual fields, log sampling, hooks, and integration with Go's context package and net/http. It offers both JSON and CBOR binary encoding formats, with optional pretty-printing for development environments. Zerolog addresses the performance bottlenecks of traditional logging libraries while maintaining simplicity and developer experience, making it suitable for high-throughput distributed systems requiring fast, structured log output for monitoring and observability pipelines.
