Rich is a Python library for terminal-based text formatting and visual enhancement, targeting developers across CLI applications, DevOps tooling, and system administration domains. Built on ANSI escape sequences and terminal capabilities detection, it provides programmatic APIs for rendering styled text, progress bars, tables, syntax-highlighted code, and enhanced tracebacks directly in terminal environments. The library addresses the limitation of plain terminal output by offering cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows Terminal) with true color support, emoji rendering, and Jupyter notebook integration. Rich serves Python developers building command-line tools, automation scripts, and debugging utilities who need rich visual feedback without GUI dependencies, replacing basic print statements with structured, colorized output that improves user experience and information density in terminal-based workflows.
