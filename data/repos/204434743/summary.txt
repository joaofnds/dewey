This repository provides printable parody sticker designs that mimic famous technology brand logos while displaying competitor company names, creating humorous "misbrand" combinations for IT culture. Targeting software developers, system administrators, and technology professionals across web development, DevOps, and general IT domains, the project serves as a satirical commentary on tech industry brand rivalries and corporate competition. The repository functions as a digital asset collection rather than a traditional code project, offering downloadable design files for custom printing through third-party sticker vendors. Users can access ready-to-print graphics that blend recognizable visual branding elements with conflicting textual identities, appealing to developers and IT professionals who appreciate industry humor and want to express ironic commentary about technology ecosystems through laptop stickers and workspace decoration.
