Schemer2 is a Go-based command-line utility for terminal colorscheme management and conversion across multiple terminal emulators. It targets developers, system administrators, and power users who customize their terminal environments by extracting color palettes from images (PNG/JPEG) or existing terminal configurations and converting between formats including Xterm, URXvt, iTerm2, Terminator, Konsole, GNOME Terminal, and others. The tool supports bidirectional conversion between terminal config files and visual representations, enabling users to generate colorschemes from wallpapers or create matching terminal themes. Built with Go's image processing capabilities, it addresses the fragmentation in terminal colorscheme formats by providing automated conversion between incompatible configuration syntaxes, eliminating manual color code translation for DevOps professionals and terminal enthusiasts managing multiple systems.
