GJSON is a high-performance JSON parsing library for Rust that provides efficient value extraction from JSON documents without full deserialization. It implements a specialized path syntax using dot notation (e.g., "name.last") with support for array indexing, wildcards, conditional queries, and modifiers to navigate and extract specific values from complex JSON structures. The library targets backend developers, API integrators, and data processing applications requiring fast JSON parsing with minimal memory overhead. Key features include one-line value retrieval, iterator support for arrays/objects, JSON Lines parsing, and direct conversion to Rust primitive types (i64, f64, bool, str). This crate serves web services, data pipelines, and configuration management systems where selective JSON parsing performance is critical, offering an alternative to heavyweight serde-based full document parsing when only specific fields are needed.
