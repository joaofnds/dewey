`Tini` is a small, C-language application designed as a minimal `init` process specifically for containerized environments like Docker. Its core functionality revolves around reaping zombie processes and forwarding signals to ensure proper process management within containers, improving stability and signal handling. Primarily a standalone command-line tool, it provides features like signal remapping, process group killing, and parent death signal configuration, enabling more controlled container behavior. Its architecture focuses on a single C executable with minimal dependencies, targeting system administrators and developers deploying applications in containerized systems.
