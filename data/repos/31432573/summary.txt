Tini is a minimal init system written in C specifically designed for containerized environments, particularly Docker containers. It serves as PID 1 within containers to handle critical process management tasks including zombie process reaping, signal forwarding, and proper child process lifecycle management. The tool addresses fundamental Linux process management issues that occur when applications run as PID 1 in containers without proper init capabilities, preventing PID exhaustion from zombie processes and ensuring standard signal handlers work correctly. Targeted at DevOps engineers, system administrators, and container developers, Tini provides a transparent drop-in solution that requires no application code changes while ensuring proper Unix process semantics in containerized deployments across Docker, Kubernetes, and other container orchestration platforms.
