Puppeteer is a TypeScript-based JavaScript library that provides programmatic control of Chrome and Firefox browsers through the DevTools Protocol and WebDriver BiDi. It enables web developers and QA engineers to automate browser interactions in headless or full GUI modes for web scraping, automated testing, performance monitoring, and UI automation tasks. The library offers high-level APIs for page navigation, element interaction, screenshot capture, PDF generation, and JavaScript execution within browser contexts. Primarily targeting the web development and testing domains, Puppeteer serves as a Node.js module that eliminates manual browser testing workflows by providing programmatic access to modern web browsers, making it essential for continuous integration pipelines, end-to-end testing frameworks, and web automation scripts.
