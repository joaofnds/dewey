PyTorch is a Python-based deep learning framework that provides GPU-accelerated tensor computation and dynamic neural network construction for machine learning research and production. Built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system (autograd), it enables researchers and ML engineers to build and train neural networks with dynamic computational graphs that can change during runtime. The framework offers NumPy-like tensor operations with CUDA/ROCm GPU acceleration, TorchScript compilation for model optimization, and integrated tools for data loading and multiprocessing. PyTorch targets data scientists, ML researchers, and AI engineers working on computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning applications, providing both low-level tensor operations and high-level neural network APIs for maximum flexibility in model development and experimentation.
