PyTorch is a Python-based deep learning library providing tensor computation with GPU acceleration and dynamic neural network construction via tape-based autograd. Key functionalities include tensor operations akin to NumPy, automatic differentiation for flexible network design, and a modular neural networks library (`torch.nn`). Architecturally, it leverages Python, integrates with libraries like NumPy and SciPy, and incorporates CUDA/ROCm for GPU acceleration. This open-source project functions as a library for researchers and developers in the machine learning domain, enabling the creation and training of deep learning models.
