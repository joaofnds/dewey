GrapesJS is an open-source web builder framework written in TypeScript that enables developers to create visual drag-and-drop page builders and template editors without requiring end-users to write code. The framework provides a comprehensive set of tools including block managers, style managers, layer managers, and asset managers for building HTML templates, newsletters, and web applications. It features local/remote storage capabilities, extensible plugin architecture, and generates clean HTML/CSS output suitable for CMS integration and dynamic template systems. Target users include web developers building content management systems, marketing platforms, or any application requiring visual web page construction capabilities, offering both framework-level integration through npm and direct browser usage via CDN distribution.
