MiniVM is a compact virtual machine runtime written in C11 that implements just-in-time (JIT) compilation for dynamic language execution. Built on Cuik's TB intermediate representation framework, it targets systems programming and language runtime development across Linux x86-64, FreeBSD amd64, Windows x64, and WebAssembly platforms. The VM focuses on optimizing performance through JIT compilation while maintaining a small footprint, supporting both mathematical computations and general scripting workloads with sub-millisecond startup times. Designed for language implementers, VM researchers, and systems developers who need an embeddable, cross-platform runtime with aggressive optimization capabilities, MiniVM serves as a foundation for building dynamic programming language interpreters and lightweight execution environments.
