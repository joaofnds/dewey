MiniVM is a high-performance virtual machine and runtime environment designed for dynamic execution. It features a just-in-time compiler based on Cuik's TB, supporting Linux x86-64, FreeBSD amd64, Windows x64, and WebAssembly platforms. Written in C11 and buildable with GCC and Clang, MiniVM provides options for optimizing for size and speed. This project is a standalone application, providing a platform for executing code, particularly targeting developers and system programmers interested in virtual machine technology and runtime optimization.
