`null-ls.nvim` is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that bridges the gap between Neovim's LSP client and non-LSP sources to inject diagnostics, code actions, formatting, and other features. It enables developers to integrate output from command-line tools into the Neovim LSP workflow. Key functionalities include custom source creation via Lua, built-in sources for formatting, diagnostics, and completion, and helpers for parsing CLI program output into LSP-compatible formats. The plugin leverages Neovim's LSP capabilities and depends on `plenary.nvim` for functionality, acting as a developer productivity tool specifically designed for Neovim users.
