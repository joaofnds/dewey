will_paginate is a Ruby pagination library designed for web application development, specifically targeting Rails, Sinatra, Hanami::View, and Sequel frameworks. It provides developers with a simple API to implement database result pagination by extending ActiveRecord and other ORMs with methods like `paginate()` and `page()` that handle query limiting and offset calculations. The library generates HTML pagination controls for views and integrates seamlessly with Ruby web frameworks to paginate large datasets efficiently. Currently in maintenance mode, it addresses the common web development problem of displaying large database result sets across multiple pages without loading all records into memory, making it essential for Ruby web developers building data-driven applications with performance considerations.
