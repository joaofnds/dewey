LIPS (LIPS Is Pretty Simple) is a JavaScript-based Scheme interpreter that implements R5RS/R7RS Lisp specifications for web and Node.js environments. Targeting web developers and programming language enthusiasts, it provides a complete Lisp/Scheme runtime with features including hygienic macros, numerical towers with BigInt support, asynchronous execution with automatic Promise resolution, and bidirectional JavaScript interoperability. The interpreter supports REPL environments, bookmarklet deployment, and can execute both in browsers and as standalone Node.js applications. It addresses the need for functional programming capabilities in JavaScript ecosystems while maintaining Scheme language compatibility, enabling developers to leverage Lisp's powerful macro system and functional paradigms within modern web development workflows. The project includes extensive SRFI (Scheme Request for Implementation) support and provides both programmatic APIs and command-line interfaces.
