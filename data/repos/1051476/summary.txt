PlantUML is a Java-based, diagram-as-code tool that generates various UML and non-UML diagrams from textual descriptions. The project facilitates the creation of numerous diagram types, including sequence, use case, class, object, activity, component, deployment, state, timing, and non-UML diagrams such as JSON, YAML, EBNF, Regex, and others. Users can leverage its features, which include hyperlinks, rich text support, and OpenIconic icons, to visually represent complex systems and data. It is a standalone application and library intended for software developers and architects seeking to document and visualize system designs.
