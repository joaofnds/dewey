PlantUML is a Java-based diagram generation tool that converts textual descriptions into visual UML and non-UML diagrams. It serves the software development, system architecture, and documentation domains by enabling diagram-as-code workflows for developers, architects, and technical writers. The tool supports comprehensive UML diagram types (sequence, class, component, deployment, activity, state) and specialized diagrams (Gantt charts, network diagrams, mind maps, ER diagrams). Built in Java with multi-license compatibility (GPL, LGPL, Apache, Eclipse, MIT), PlantUML integrates into development pipelines and documentation systems, solving the problem of maintaining synchronized visual documentation by treating diagrams as version-controlled code artifacts rather than static images.
