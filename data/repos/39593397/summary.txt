`clojerl` is an unofficial implementation of the Clojure programming language on the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM), aiming to bring Clojure's functional programming paradigm and abstractions to the Erlang ecosystem. It provides features like a REPL for interactive development, examples of Clojure code execution on the BEAM, and integration with the Erlang/OTP environment. This project is a plugin that leverages the `rebar3` build tool and facilitates interoperability between Clojure and Erlang codebases, targeting developers familiar with both Clojure and Erlang, seeking to utilize the BEAM's robustness and concurrency model.
