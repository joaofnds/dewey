Clojerl is an experimental implementation of the Clojure programming language that compiles to and runs on the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM). It targets distributed systems developers and functional programming enthusiasts who want to leverage Clojure's Lisp syntax, immutable data structures, and abstractions (protocols, multimethods, sequences) while gaining access to Erlang's proven concurrency model and fault-tolerance capabilities. Built using Erlang/OTP and rebar3, it provides REPL support, interoperability with Erlang libraries, and enables development of concurrent, scalable applications in domains like telecommunications, real-time systems, and distributed computing. The project bridges the gap between Clojure's expressive functional programming paradigm and Erlang's robust actor-based concurrency model, allowing developers to build fault-tolerant distributed systems using familiar Clojure semantics.
