Coherence is a comprehensive authentication system library for Phoenix web applications built in Elixir. It provides nine modular authentication components including database authentication with encrypted passwords, user registration, email confirmation, password recovery, account locking after failed attempts, login tracking, invitation-based user onboarding, and persistent "remember me" sessions. The library generates boilerplate code including Phoenix controllers, views, templates, migrations, and email modules that developers can customize for their specific needs. It supports both legacy Phoenix and modern Phx project structures, integrates with Phoenix's MVC architecture, and handles common web authentication patterns like token-based password resets and account lockouts. Coherence targets Elixir web developers building Phoenix applications who need production-ready authentication functionality without implementing security-critical authentication logic from scratch.
