`Flexbox Froggy` is a web-based game designed to teach and reinforce CSS flexbox concepts. Built using JavaScript, it presents interactive challenges where users manipulate flexbox properties to position elements correctly. The project is a standalone web application, accessible via a dedicated website, and serves as an educational tool for front-end developers, providing a gamified approach to learning CSS layout.
