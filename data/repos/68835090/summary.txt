parinfer-mode is a deprecated Emacs Lisp package that implements Parinfer functionality for Lisp programming in Emacs. This editor mode automatically maintains consistency between parentheses and indentation in Lisp code through two operational modes: Indent Mode (user controls indentation, Parinfer corrects parentheses) and Paren Mode (user controls parentheses, Parinfer corrects indentation). Built on parinfer-elisp, it targets Lisp developers working with Clojure, Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, and Scheme in the Emacs editor environment. The package integrates with popular Emacs packages like Evil, Lispy, and Paredit, providing extensions for enhanced editing workflows. Originally designed to solve the structural editing challenges inherent in Lisp's heavily parenthesized syntax, the project was discontinued due to performance limitations in pure Emacs Lisp implementation, with users now directed to parinfer-rust-mode for better performance.
