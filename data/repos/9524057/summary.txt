The prometheus/node_exporter is a Go-based system monitoring agent that exposes hardware and operating system metrics from Unix-like systems to Prometheus monitoring infrastructure. Designed for DevOps and site reliability engineering workflows, it collects comprehensive host-level telemetry including CPU, memory, disk, network, filesystem, and kernel statistics by interfacing with procfs and sysfs. The exporter features pluggable metric collectors with configurable include/exclude patterns, supports containerized deployment with host namespace access, and serves metrics via HTTP on port 9100. Target users are system administrators, DevOps engineers, and SRE teams implementing observability stacks who need granular infrastructure monitoring capabilities for alerting, capacity planning, and performance analysis across their server fleet.
