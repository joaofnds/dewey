`vim-which-key` is a Vim plugin designed to enhance developer productivity by displaying keybindings in a popup, inspired by Emacs' `which-key`. Written in Vim Script, it dynamically shows available mappings for leader keys and local leader keys, offering a UI built upon Vim's `popup` and NeoVim's `floating_win` features. Key functionalities include showing all mappings after a prefix, instant responses, and dynamic updates with customizable group names and descriptions. It integrates with popular Vim plugin managers and provides configuration options for both Vim 8 and NeoVim environments, requiring the `timeout` option to be enabled.
