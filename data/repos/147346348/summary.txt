vim-which-key is a Vim/Neovim plugin that provides interactive keybinding discovery through popup overlays, targeting software developers and text editor power users. Written in Vim Script, it ports Emacs which-key functionality to display available key combinations following prefix keys like leader keys, helping users navigate complex keybinding hierarchies. The plugin leverages Vim's native popup windows and Neovim's floating windows for UI presentation, dynamically updating mappings in real-time based on user input within configurable timeout periods. It addresses the common problem of memorizing extensive custom keybindings in highly customized Vim configurations, particularly beneficial for users of complex Vim distributions like Space-vim who need visual assistance to discover and execute multi-key command sequences efficiently.
