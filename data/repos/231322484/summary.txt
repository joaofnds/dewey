**horcrux** is a Go-based file encryption and splitting utility that implements Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme to divide files into encrypted fragments (horcruxes) with configurable threshold reconstruction requirements. The tool addresses secure file storage and transmission challenges in cybersecurity and data protection domains by eliminating password dependency through distributed secret sharing. It provides two core operations: `split` command to fragment files into multiple encrypted pieces, and `bind` command to reconstruct original files from a minimum threshold of fragments. Built using Go's crypto/rand for key generation and adapted from Hashicorp Vault's implementation, it targets security-conscious users, system administrators, and individuals requiring secure long-term file storage without traditional password-based encryption risks. The solution enables secure multi-channel file transmission and distributed backup strategies.
