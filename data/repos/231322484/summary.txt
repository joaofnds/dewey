`Horcrux` is a command-line application written in Go designed to split files into encrypted fragments, preventing the need to remember a password. Utilizing the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme, it divides a file's encryption key into multiple "horcruxes," requiring a configurable threshold of fragments to reconstruct the original file. It provides `split` and `bind` commands for fragment creation and reassembly, respectively. This standalone CLI tool addresses data security and potentially privacy needs, targeting users seeking a robust method for file fragmentation and secure storage.
