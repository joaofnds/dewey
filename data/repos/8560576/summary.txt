Pedestal is a Clojure-based web application framework designed for server-side development, targeting backend web developers building HTTP services and APIs. It provides a comprehensive set of libraries for handling asynchronous HTTP requests, WebSocket connections, and Server-Sent Events with built-in security defaults. The framework integrates with servlet containers like Jetty 12 and Http-Kit, offering features such as request routing, middleware composition, logging, metrics collection, and distributed tracing. Pedestal addresses the need for scalable, maintainable web services by leveraging Clojure's functional programming paradigms and immutable data structures, while providing production-ready capabilities for enterprise web application development requiring high concurrency and real-time communication features.
