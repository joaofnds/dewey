The `torvalds/linux` repository houses the complete source code for the Linux kernel, the core of the Linux operating system. Its primary function is to manage hardware resources and provide a foundational layer for software execution. Written in C, it encompasses a vast collection of device drivers, file systems, networking stacks, and system call interfaces. This project is a comprehensive operating system kernel and serves as a core component for embedded systems, servers, and desktop environments.
