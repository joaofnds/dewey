The Linux kernel repository contains the core source code for the Linux operating system kernel, written primarily in C with assembly language components. This foundational system software manages hardware abstraction, process scheduling, memory management, device drivers, file systems, and network protocols across diverse computing platforms from embedded systems to enterprise servers. The kernel serves as the critical interface between application software and computer hardware, handling system calls, interrupt management, and resource allocation. Target users include kernel developers, system programmers, hardware engineers, and Linux distribution maintainers who need to modify, compile, or extend core operating system functionality. The codebase addresses fundamental problems in operating system design including concurrent process execution, hardware compatibility, security isolation, and performance optimization across multiple processor architectures.
