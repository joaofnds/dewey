Cerebro is an open-source desktop application launcher built with Electron and React that serves as a productivity tool for power users and developers. The cross-platform launcher provides a command palette-style interface for quickly searching and executing system operations including web searches, application launching, file system navigation with previews, calculations, and unit conversions. Built on a dual-renderer process architecture using JavaScript/Node.js, it features an extensible plugin system allowing users to install additional functionality through npm-style package management. The application targets productivity-focused users, developers, and system administrators who need rapid access to system functions and tools through keyboard shortcuts, offering an Alfred/Spotlight alternative with vim-like navigation keybindings and customizable themes for efficient workflow automation.
