org-mac-link is an Emacs Lisp package that enables seamless integration between Org-mode and macOS applications by automatically generating org-mode links to selected items across various Mac apps. The package uses AppleScript integration to extract references from applications including Finder, Mail, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, DEVONthink, Evernote, Microsoft Outlook, Skim PDF viewer, and others, then converts them into properly formatted org-mode links for documentation and note-taking workflows. Targeted at Emacs users and knowledge workers on macOS who utilize Org-mode for personal knowledge management, project planning, and documentation, the package solves the friction of manually creating links between Org-mode documents and external Mac application content, supporting extensible handler registration for additional applications through customizable descriptors.
