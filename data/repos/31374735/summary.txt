`fwupd` is a system daemon written in C designed for automating, securing, and reliably updating firmware on Linux systems. It interacts with the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) to download and apply firmware updates for supported devices. Key functionalities include device detection, metadata refreshing, update application (including live and boot-time updates), and reporting of update statuses. This is a standalone application, primarily accessed via a command-line interface (`fwupdmgr`), but also supporting various graphical frontends.
