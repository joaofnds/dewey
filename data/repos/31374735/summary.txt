fwupd is a Linux system daemon written in C that provides automated firmware update capabilities for hardware devices. Operating in the system administration and Linux distribution domain, it bridges the gap between session-level software and low-level firmware management by offering a standardized D-Bus interface for firmware updates. The daemon integrates with the Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS) to distribute signed firmware packages, supports multiple hardware protocols and update mechanisms, and includes enterprise-grade features like update approval workflows. Built with GLib and targeting system administrators, distribution maintainers, and OEM vendors, fwupd solves the critical problem of secure, reliable firmware delivery and installation across diverse hardware ecosystems in Linux environments, replacing manual and vendor-specific firmware update processes.
