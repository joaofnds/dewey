This repository implements an interactive terrain erosion simulation within a web browser, leveraging WebGL for GPU-accelerated rendering and fluid dynamics calculations. The project allows users to visualize and manipulate erosion processes on a procedurally generated terrain, including adding/subtracting water and height modifications via brush tools, and controlling erosion parameters like evaporation and erosion constants. Built with TypeScript, it features debug views and camera controls for exploration, and incorporates techniques like semi-Lagrangian advection for water momentum and MacCormack advection for sediment transport. It is a standalone web application and targets users interested in interactive simulations and terrain generation techniques.
