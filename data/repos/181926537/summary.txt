This repository implements a real-time hydraulic erosion simulation system that runs in web browsers using WebGL and TypeScript. Targeting computer graphics developers and simulation enthusiasts, it leverages GPU programming to simulate fluid dynamics and terrain modification through physics-based erosion algorithms including sediment transport, water flow, and deposition. The system features interactive terrain editing with brush tools, permanent water source placement, real-time parameter adjustment for erosion constants (Kc, Ks, Kd), and multiple visualization modes including velocity field heatmaps and sediment advection. Built on grid-based simulation methods with semi-Lagrangian and MacCormack advection schemes, it addresses the need for accessible, browser-based terrain generation tools for procedural content creation, educational visualization, and game development prototyping without requiring specialized desktop software installations.
