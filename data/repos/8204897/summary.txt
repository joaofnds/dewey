Javelin is a ClojureScript library providing spreadsheet-like dataflow programming capabilities. It enables reactive programming within ClojureScript environments through the introduction of "cell" references, which can be input cells or formula cells.  Key features include transactional updates using the `dosync` macro for batched cell modifications, support for lenses to access and update parts of data structures, and the `cell=` and `defc=` macros for defining formula cells. It is a library designed for ClojureScript developers seeking to build reactive applications, particularly those requiring dataflow logic within their client-side applications.
