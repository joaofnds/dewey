Javelin is a ClojureScript library that implements spreadsheet-like reactive dataflow programming for web applications. It provides input cells and formula cells that automatically propagate changes through dependency graphs, similar to Excel cell relationships but in functional programming. The library introduces a Cell reference type implementing IWatchable, with input cells updated via swap!/reset! and read-only formula cells that reactively update based on mathematical formulas. Key features include atomic transactions via dosync, macro-based formula definitions with cell= and defc=, and automatic dependency tracking. Targeted at ClojureScript developers building interactive web UIs, it solves the problem of managing complex state dependencies and UI updates in functional reactive programming, particularly useful with frameworks like Hoplon for creating responsive single-page applications with minimal imperative state management code.
