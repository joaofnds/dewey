IsoCity is a browser-based isometric city building game implemented in vanilla JavaScript for web game development. This educational/recreational project demonstrates 2D canvas rendering techniques for creating isometric visual perspectives without requiring complex game engines or frameworks. The application uses HTML5 Canvas API and JavaScript for real-time graphics rendering, enabling users to construct virtual cities through a tile-based building system. Designed as a simplified city builder without economic simulation, budget constraints, or win conditions, it serves as a creative sandbox tool. The project targets web developers interested in game development fundamentals, JavaScript graphics programming, and isometric rendering techniques, while also appealing to casual users seeking a lightweight browser-based building experience.
