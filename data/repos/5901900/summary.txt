The `disruptor` repository provides a high-performance inter-thread messaging library written in Java, designed for concurrent programming. It leverages the Disruptor pattern to facilitate low-latency, high-throughput data exchange between threads, particularly within the context of demanding applications. The library's core functionality revolves around an efficient, lock-free mechanism for event processing and data transfer, as a direct alternative to traditional queue-based concurrency solutions. This Java library aims to improve application throughput and reduce latency.
