This repository provides tools and fonts for integrating symbol/icon fonts into terminal environments using monospace fonts. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and terminal power users, it implements a freetype2 fallback strategy to display Font Awesome, Devicons, Octicons, and Pomicons symbols in terminal prompts and interfaces. The solution includes pre-built font files, shell scripts for font mapping variables, and fontconfig configuration files to avoid hardcoded Unicode codepoints. Built primarily with Shell scripts and font configuration files, it addresses the problem of creating information-dense terminal interfaces with visual symbols for Git status, file types, and system information. The repository supports Linux, macOS, and Windows installations through package managers and manual font configuration setup.
