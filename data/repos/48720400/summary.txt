evil-ediff is an Emacs Lisp package that integrates Vim-style keybindings into Emacs' ediff mode, a built-in tool for comparing and merging files or buffers. Targeting software developers and system administrators who prefer Vim-like modal editing but work within the Emacs ecosystem, this package remaps ediff's default keybindings to familiar Vim commands such as j/k for navigation, gg/G for jumping to first/last differences, and C-d/C-u for scrolling. The package addresses the workflow friction experienced by evil-mode users (Vim emulation in Emacs) when performing diff operations, file comparisons, and merge conflict resolution. Originally maintained as a standalone package, it has been merged into the larger Evil Collection project, which provides comprehensive Vim keybinding integration across various Emacs modes and packages.
