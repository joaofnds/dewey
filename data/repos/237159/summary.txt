Express.js is a minimalist web application framework built on Node.js for server-side JavaScript development. It provides a lightweight HTTP server foundation with robust routing capabilities, middleware support, and template engine integration for building web applications, REST APIs, and single-page applications. The framework offers essential web server utilities including request/response handling, HTTP helpers for redirection and caching, content negotiation, and view rendering systems. Targeted at JavaScript developers building backend services and web applications, Express serves as a foundational layer for creating scalable web servers without imposing opinionated architectural constraints. It addresses the need for a flexible, performance-oriented HTTP server framework in the Node.js ecosystem, enabling rapid development of web services and APIs.
