Express is a minimalist, unopinionated web application framework designed for Node.js, providing tools for building web servers and APIs. Core functionalities include robust routing, middleware support for request handling, and efficient management of HTTP requests and responses. Built entirely in JavaScript, the framework facilitates the rapid development of web applications by abstracting away many of the complexities of server-side logic. It serves as a foundational library for developers working in the web application backend domain.
