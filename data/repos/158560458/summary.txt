Built in Go, it translates Compose specifications into Kubernetes resources, enabling streamlined deployment and management of containerized applications on Kubernetes. Key functionalities include deploying stacks defined by `docker-compose.yml` files, utilizing the Docker CLI with a Kubernetes orchestrator, and offering debugging capabilities via Delve for development. This standalone application targets developers using Docker Compose to manage deployments within Kubernetes environments.
