Compose on Kubernetes is a now-deprecated Go-based operator that enables deployment of Docker Compose applications directly onto Kubernetes clusters. Targeting DevOps engineers and containerization workflows, it bridges Docker Compose's simple YAML-based service definitions with Kubernetes' orchestration capabilities by translating Compose files into native Kubernetes objects like Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps. The system consists of a custom API server and controller that extend Kubernetes with `compose.docker.com` custom resources, requiring an etcd backend for state management. It integrates with Docker CLI's stack deployment commands using the `--orchestrator=kubernetes` flag, allowing developers familiar with Docker Compose to deploy multi-service applications to Kubernetes without manually writing Kubernetes manifests, effectively lowering the barrier to Kubernetes adoption for Docker-centric development teams.
