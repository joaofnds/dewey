Kata Containers is a container runtime implementation that bridges traditional containers with virtual machine security by running containers inside lightweight VMs. Built primarily in Rust, it integrates with the container ecosystem through OCI/CRI standards, supporting Kubernetes, Docker, and CRI-O orchestration platforms. The project targets DevOps and platform engineering teams requiring enhanced workload isolation without sacrificing container performance characteristics. It supports multiple hypervisors including QEMU, Firecracker, ACRN, and includes a custom Dragonball VMM, running across x86_64, ARM64, PowerPC, and s390x architectures with hardware virtualization extensions. The runtime provides containerd shimv2 implementation and includes an in-VM agent for container lifecycle management, addressing security-sensitive containerized workloads that need stronger isolation boundaries than traditional Linux namespaces provide while maintaining container-like operational semantics.
