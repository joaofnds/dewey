Kata Containers is an open-source project providing a standard implementation of lightweight Virtual Machines (VMs) that replicate container functionality while offering VM-level isolation and security. Written primarily in Rust, it enables running containers with the security advantages of virtual machines, supporting architectures like x86_64, aarch64, ppc64le, and s390x. Key functionalities include a runtime component, agent process, and hypervisor support, integrating with container runtimes like containerd and CRI-O, and supporting technologies such as KVM, QEMU, and Firecracker. This project is a core infrastructure component for containerized workloads, providing enhanced security and isolation for containerized applications.
