**go-semantic-release/semantic-release** is a Go-based implementation of semantic release automation for DevOps and CI/CD pipelines. It automates version management, changelog generation, and package publishing by analyzing commit messages following Conventional Commits specification to determine semantic version bumps (major, minor, patch). The tool integrates with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other CI systems through a plugin architecture using hashicorp/go-plugin, supporting providers like GitHub, GitLab, and Git repositories. It eliminates Node.js dependencies of the original semantic-release by providing a single binary executable, while offering extensible functionality through plugins for commit analysis, changelog generation, and release hooks like GoReleaser integration. Target users are software developers, DevOps engineers, and release managers seeking automated, deterministic release workflows based on semantic versioning principles.
