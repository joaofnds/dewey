`go-semantic-release/semantic-release` is a Go-based, standalone command-line application designed to automate the semantic versioning and release process of software projects. It facilitates fully automated publishing by leveraging conventional commit messages to determine the next semantic version, generate changelogs, and publish releases to platforms like GitHub and GitLab. Key features include plugin extensibility for custom functionality, support for multiple CI/CD systems through condition plugins, and an air-gapped operation mode. This project is a developer productivity tool, specifically targeting developers seeking to streamline software release cycles.
