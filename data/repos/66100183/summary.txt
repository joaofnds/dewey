This repository provides a Docker-based Apache Kafka development environment designed for rapid prototyping and testing in the data streaming domain. It packages a complete Kafka ecosystem including Kafka broker, Zookeeper, Confluent Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, REST Proxy, and 25+ pre-configured connectors from Lenses.io's Stream Reactor for ETL operations. The solution targets data engineers and developers working with real-time data pipelines who need a quickly deployable, full-featured Kafka stack without complex setup procedures. Built using Shell scripts for Docker orchestration, it includes web-based management UIs for topics, schemas, and connectors, exposing standard Kafka ports (9092 for broker, 8081 for Schema Registry, 8083 for Connect). This addresses the common challenge of setting up complex Kafka infrastructure for development, testing, and proof-of-concept scenarios in streaming data architectures.
