`Flowy` is a minimal JavaScript library designed for creating flowchart functionality within web applications. It enables users to build interactive flowcharts with drag-and-drop capabilities, automatic snapping, scrolling, and block rearrangement features, with mobile support and no external dependencies. Developers can integrate Flowy into their projects by including the JavaScript and CSS files, defining draggable blocks, and initializing the library with custom callbacks for event handling (grab, release, snap, and rearrange). The library offers methods for exporting and importing flowchart data in JSON format, and for deleting all blocks. This is a JavaScript library primarily intended for front-end developers aiming to incorporate flowchart and workflow diagramming capabilities into web applications.
