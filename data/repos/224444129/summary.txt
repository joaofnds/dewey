Flowy is a lightweight vanilla JavaScript library designed for web developers to implement interactive flowchart and diagram functionality in web applications. The library provides a drag-and-drop engine with automatic snapping, block rearrangement, and responsive canvas manipulation for building workflow automation tools, mind mapping applications, and visual programming interfaces. It targets frontend developers working on marketing automation platforms, business process management tools, and educational software requiring visual flow representation. The library operates without dependencies, offering callback-driven architecture for handling block interactions, data serialization for saving/loading flowcharts, and mobile-responsive design. Flowy specifically addresses the complexity of implementing flowchart UI components from scratch, providing a ready-to-use solution for applications requiring visual workflow creation similar to Zapier or other automation platforms.
