This Emacs Lisp package provides an integrated code review interface within Emacs for web development teams using Git-based version control platforms. Built on Emacs frameworks like magit-section and transient, it enables developers to perform complete pull request reviews without leaving their editor, supporting GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket workflows. Key functionality includes viewing PR diffs, adding inline comments with code suggestions, approving/rejecting changes, managing labels and assignees, replying to review threads, and handling outdated comments with proper diff context. The package integrates with Emacs forge for seamless VCS operations and supports advanced features like PR merging, comment reactions, binary file handling, and save/resume capabilities for in-progress reviews, targeting Emacs-native developers who want to streamline their code review workflow within their existing development environment.
