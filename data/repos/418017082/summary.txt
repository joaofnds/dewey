`code-review` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to facilitate code reviews directly within the Emacs text editor. It integrates with version control providers, including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, enabling users to review pull requests without leaving their editing environment. Core functionalities include starting reviews from URLs, a modern UI utilizing `magit-section` and `transient`, reading and replying to comments, adding code suggestions, approving/rejecting changes, and integrating with forge-topic-view. This extension-style project leverages Emacs Lisp and provides keybindings for streamlined interaction, targeting developers who use Emacs for software development and version control workflows.
