Dracula Theme is a comprehensive dark color scheme project providing consistent visual theming across development tools and applications. It targets software developers, designers, and power users working across diverse development environments including code editors (VS Code, Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text), IDEs (JetBrains, Xcode), terminals (iTerm, Hyper, Zsh), and productivity tools (Alfred, Slack). The project maintains a standardized color palette with defined hex, RGB, and HSL values ensuring visual consistency and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance with 4.5:1 contrast ratios. Built as a distributed theming system, it addresses the problem of fragmented visual experiences across developer toolchains by providing unified aesthetic implementation through platform-specific theme packages, enabling developers to maintain consistent visual environments regardless of their chosen development stack.
