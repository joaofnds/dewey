This repository is a Node.js-based web application that generates Git repositories with precisely timed commits to create visual patterns in GitHub's contribution calendar grid. The tool runs a local server on port 9000 serving an HTML interface where developers can design custom contribution patterns, then generates a Git repository with backdated commits that, when pushed to GitHub, displays the desired visual pattern on their profile's contribution graph. Built primarily with HTML/JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js for the backend Git repository generation, it targets web developers and GitHub users who want to manipulate their contribution history for aesthetic or demonstration purposes. The application addresses the specific use case of creating deliberate visual patterns in GitHub's contribution visualization system, functioning as both a novelty tool and a demonstration of Git's commit timestamp manipulation capabilities within the developer tools ecosystem.
