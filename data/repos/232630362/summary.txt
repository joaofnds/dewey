Boundary is an identity-aware proxy built in Go designed for secure access management of dynamic infrastructure. It provides features for integrating with identity providers via OpenID Connect, just-in-time network access, session credential management, endpoint discovery, and session control. The project utilizes a controller/worker architecture, requires a SQL database (PostgreSQL supported) and a KMS for secure operations, and offers CLI and desktop clients for user interaction. Boundary is a standalone application aimed at system administrators and security professionals, providing a zero-trust approach to network access.
