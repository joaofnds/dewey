Boundary is a Go-based identity-aware proxy system designed for zero-trust network access management in DevOps and cloud infrastructure environments. It provides just-in-time access to network resources through a controller-worker architecture, where controllers serve the API and coordinate sessions while workers handle session management. The system integrates with PostgreSQL for configuration storage, various KMS providers (cloud KMS or HashiCorp Vault) for encryption, and supports OpenID Connect for identity provider integration. Boundary eliminates the need for VPNs or host-based agents by acting as a secure proxy for SSH, RDP, and other protocol connections. It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and security teams managing access to dynamic infrastructure across cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments, offering automated endpoint discovery and session credential management.
