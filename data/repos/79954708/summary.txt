Staticcheck is an advanced static analysis linter for Go programming language that detects bugs, performance issues, code simplifications, and style violations through compile-time analysis. Targeting Go developers and software engineering teams, it operates on Go source code without execution to identify potential runtime errors, inefficient patterns, and code quality issues. The repository provides multiple command-line tools including the core staticcheck analyzer, struct layout optimization utilities (structlayout, structlayout-optimize, structlayout-pretty), and supporting Go libraries for static analysis implementation. It addresses code quality assurance in Go development workflows by automating detection of common programming mistakes, performance bottlenecks, and style inconsistencies that manual code review might miss, integrating into CI/CD pipelines and development environments.
