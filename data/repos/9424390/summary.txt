vim-multiple-cursors is a deprecated Vim plugin written in Vim script that implements Sublime Text-style multiple cursor functionality for text editing. Targeted at software developers and power users who use Vim as their primary editor, it enables simultaneous editing at multiple cursor positions through keyboard shortcuts like `<C-n>` for adding cursors and `<C-x>` for skipping matches. The plugin supports pattern matching, visual selection operations, and integrates with Vim's normal/insert/visual modes for multi-point text manipulation. It solves the problem of efficient batch editing and refactoring within Vim by allowing users to select and modify multiple text instances simultaneously, mimicking modern editor features while maintaining Vim's modal editing paradigm. The plugin has been superseded by vim-visual-multi for continued development.
