The `kdl-org/kdl` repository defines the KDL (Key-Value Document Language) specification, a human-readable document format designed for both serialization and configuration. KDL offers an XML-like node structure with support for values, key-value pairs, and comments, serving as an alternative to JSON, YAML, and XML. The project includes specifications for KDL itself, as well as related query and schema languages, with implementations available in various languages including C, Rust, JavaScript, and others. It's a language specification project, targeted at developers and implementors of parsing and serialization libraries, with a focus on providing a flexible and human-maintainable data format.
