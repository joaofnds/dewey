KDL is a document language specification designed as an alternative serialization format and configuration language to JSON, YAML, and XML. The repository contains the formal language specification, query language (CSS selector-based), and schema validation system for KDL's human-readable, CLI-command-like syntax with XML-style node semantics. Targeted at software developers and DevOps engineers, KDL addresses configuration management and data serialization needs across multiple programming languages with implementations in C, Rust, JavaScript, Python, Go, and others. The specification supports modern features like multi-line strings, node-level commenting, and type annotations, making it suitable for package manifests, application configuration files, and structured data interchange in development toolchains and system administration workflows.
