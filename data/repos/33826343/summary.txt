This repository provides Homebrew formulae for installing Zathura, a minimalist document viewer, on macOS systems. Targeting developers and power users who prefer keyboard-driven PDF readers, it addresses the challenge of building Zathura's GTK-based architecture on macOS through custom Ruby formulae. The tap includes the core Zathura application and five plugin packages (zathura-pdf-mupdf, zathura-pdf-poppler, zathura-djvu, zathura-cb, zathura-ps) that enable support for various document formats including PDF, DjVu, PostScript, and comic book archives. The repository solves dependency management complexities inherent in porting Linux-native applications to macOS, providing automated plugin linking, macOS app bundle conversion, and proper library path configuration for seamless integration with the macOS ecosystem.
