Torch/torch7 is a C library providing core functionalities for numerical computing, specifically focused on defining and operating on multi-dimensional tensors. It forms the basis for deep learning operations, including tensor manipulation, mathematical calculations, file I/O, and utility functions like timing and command-line argument parsing. The library includes features for tensor storage, mathematical operations, and serialization. Although it's no longer in active development, its core concepts and functionalities have been reimplemented in the ATen C++11 library within the PyTorch project. This library, a core component of the Torch ecosystem, is a foundational element for machine learning and scientific computing, targeting researchers and developers.
