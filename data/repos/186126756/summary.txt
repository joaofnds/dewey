McMojave-kde is a comprehensive desktop theming package that replicates macOS Mojave's visual design for KDE Plasma desktop environments on Linux systems. Built using QML and following KDE's theming architecture, it provides a complete visual transformation including Aurorae window decorations, Kvantum widget styling, plasma color schemes, desktop themes, and look-and-feel configurations. The repository targets Linux desktop users and system administrators who want to achieve macOS-like aesthetics on KDE Plasma while maintaining native Linux functionality. It addresses the desktop customization use case by offering a one-script installation process that applies consistent macOS Mojave styling across all KDE interface elements, including window managers, application widgets, and desktop components, enabling users to transform their Linux desktop environment's appearance without switching operating systems.
