Helm is an incremental completion and selection narrowing framework for the Emacs text editor, implemented in Emacs Lisp. It targets software developers, system administrators, and power users who utilize Emacs as their primary development environment and productivity tool. The framework provides a unified interface for fuzzy matching, filtering, and selecting from various data sources including files, buffers, commands, documentation, and system processes. Helm solves the problem of efficient navigation and discovery within Emacs by replacing traditional completion mechanisms with a real-time, interactive search interface that narrows results as users type. It offers an extensible API for building custom completion sources and integrates with existing Emacs workflows, significantly improving productivity for tasks like file management, code navigation, command execution, and information retrieval within the Emacs ecosystem.
