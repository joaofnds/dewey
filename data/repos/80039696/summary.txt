fp-ts is a TypeScript library that brings functional programming paradigms and abstractions to JavaScript/TypeScript development. It implements core functional programming concepts including algebraic data types (Option, Either), monadic structures (IO, Task), and higher-kinded types despite TypeScript's native limitations. The library provides type classes like Functor, Applicative, and Monad, enabling developers to write pure functional applications with compile-time type safety. Inspired by Haskell, PureScript, and Scala, it targets web developers and TypeScript engineers who want to apply functional programming principles in frontend, backend, or full-stack JavaScript applications. The project requires TypeScript 3.5+ with strict mode enabled and is transitioning to merge with the Effect-TS ecosystem as its successor.
