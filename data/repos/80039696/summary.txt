`fp-ts` is a TypeScript library providing functional programming abstractions and data types. It enables developers to leverage functional programming paradigms within TypeScript, incorporating features like algebraic data types (Option, Either), type classes (Functor, Monad), and support for Higher Kinded Types. Primarily a library, it facilitates the development of pure functional programming applications and libraries, inspired by functional languages like Haskell, PureScript, and Scala. The project is designed for use with TypeScript and the `strict` flag, with the community actively building upon the library through integrations within the effect-ts ecosystem.
