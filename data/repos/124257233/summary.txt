react-spring is a TypeScript-based animation library for React applications that implements spring physics algorithms to create smooth, natural animations across multiple platforms. Built for web developers working with React ecosystems, it provides declarative and imperative APIs through hooks like `useSpring` to animate DOM properties, supporting react-dom, react-native, react-three-fiber, react-konva, and react-zdog renderers. The library solves the problem of creating fluid, interactive animations by leveraging spring physics calculations instead of traditional CSS transitions or keyframe animations, offering cross-platform compatibility and performance optimization. Frontend developers use it to implement complex UI animations, micro-interactions, and visual transitions while maintaining consistent behavior across different React rendering targets and deployment environments.
