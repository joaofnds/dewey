Transmission is a cross-platform BitTorrent client implemented in C++. It provides various GUI applications for macOS, Windows (Qt), and Linux/BSD (GTK+ and Qt), along with a headless daemon and a web UI for remote control. The project includes command-line tools for managing torrent files and offers build instructions for both release and nightly builds, as well as building from Git. The codebase utilizes an Xcode project for macOS builds and CMake for cross-platform compilation, with contributors expected to adhere to the .clang-format code style. This is a standalone application with components for diverse user environments, allowing for downloading, managing, and sharing files through the BitTorrent protocol.
