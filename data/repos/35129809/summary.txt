Transmission is a cross-platform BitTorrent client implementation written in C++ that provides peer-to-peer file sharing capabilities across multiple deployment scenarios. The software targets system administrators, power users, and desktop users in the file sharing and content distribution domain, offering native GUI applications for macOS (Cocoa), Linux/BSD (GTK+), and Windows (Qt), alongside a headless daemon for server deployments and embedded systems like routers. It implements the BitTorrent protocol with command-line utilities (transmission-remote, transmission-create, transmission-show) for torrent management and a web-based UI for remote administration. Built using CMake with platform-specific toolchains including Xcode, it addresses decentralized file distribution needs across desktop environments and server infrastructure, solving bandwidth-efficient content sharing and network-distributed downloads.
