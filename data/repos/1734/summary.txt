AASM is a Ruby library that implements finite state machines for Ruby classes, enabling developers to model complex object lifecycles and business workflows through declarative state definitions, events, and transitions. It provides comprehensive ORM integration with ActiveRecord, Mongoid, Sequel, Dynamoid, and NoBrainer, while also supporting plain Ruby objects. The library offers advanced features including state transition callbacks, guards for conditional logic, automatic database scopes, transaction support, pessimistic locking, and built-in testing helpers for RSpec and Minitest. AASM primarily targets Ruby on Rails web developers and backend engineers who need to implement stateful business logic such as order processing, user workflows, or content management systems, providing a clean DSL to replace complex conditional logic with maintainable state machine patterns.
