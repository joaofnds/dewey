The Keycloak Admin Client for Node.js was a JavaScript library that provided programmatic access to Keycloak's REST API for administrative operations. Targeting web developers and system administrators in enterprise identity management, it enabled automated user management, realm configuration, client setup, and role administration within Keycloak identity and access management systems. Built for Node.js environments, the library facilitated integration of Keycloak administrative functions into backend applications, DevOps automation scripts, and identity governance workflows. It addressed the need for programmatic control over authentication and authorization infrastructure, allowing developers to manage SSO configurations, user provisioning, and security policies without manual admin console interaction. The repository has been relocated to the main Keycloak project for consolidated maintenance.
