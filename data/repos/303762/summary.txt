Gource is a standalone, cross-platform C++ application for visualizing software version control repository history. It renders a 3D animated representation of a repository's evolution, displaying contributors, file modifications, and directory structures over time. Users can interactively explore the visualized history via keyboard and mouse controls, adjusting playback speed, camera angles, and display elements. The application leverages OpenGL for graphics rendering and supports various version control systems, with custom log format capabilities. It targets software developers seeking to understand project evolution through visual analysis.
