`Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts` is a deprecated repository formerly providing font packages, specifically "Casks", for installation on macOS. This project, associated with the Homebrew package manager ecosystem, facilitated the management and installation of fonts. Its functionality centered on packaging fonts, leveraging the `cask` format, before its features were migrated to the `Homebrew/homebrew-cask` repository. This is a collection of packages designed for use with the Homebrew package manager.
