Bundlephobia is a web-based tool for frontend developers that analyzes the performance impact of npm packages by calculating their bundle size costs when added to JavaScript applications. Built with Node.js and webpack bundling capabilities, it provides real-time size analysis for ES6 modules, CSS/SCSS packages, and dependency composition breakdowns. The platform serves web developers working on performance optimization by offering minified and gzipped size metrics, historical trends, and integration APIs used by package managers like Yarn and development tools. It addresses the critical need for bundle size awareness in modern JavaScript development workflows, helping developers make informed decisions about package inclusion to maintain optimal application performance and loading speeds.
