nui.nvim is a comprehensive UI component library for Neovim written in Lua, targeting software developers who want to build rich text-based user interfaces within the Neovim editor ecosystem. The library provides essential UI building blocks including NuiText for syntax highlighting, NuiLine for formatted text chunks, NuiTable for tabular data display, and NuiTree for hierarchical content rendering. It offers interactive components like Popup windows, Input fields, Menu systems, Split panes, and flexible Layout management with dynamic resizing and repositioning. Built specifically for Neovim 0.5.0+ using Lua APIs, it addresses the need for standardized, reusable UI components in Neovim plugin development, enabling developers to create sophisticated text-based interfaces with consistent styling, event handling, and extensible object-oriented architecture for custom component creation.
