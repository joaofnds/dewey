Apache Hive is a data warehouse software built on Apache Hadoop that facilitates SQL-based reading, writing, and management of large datasets in distributed storage. It provides SQL functionality, including OLAP functions, and supports user-defined functions (UDFs), aggregates (UDAFs), and table functions (UDTFs) for extending its capabilities. Key features include enabling ETL, reporting, and data analysis, along with mechanisms to impose structure on diverse data formats and access files stored in HDFS or other data storage systems. Hive leverages Java and can utilize either the MapReduce or Tez framework for query execution, designed to handle large-scale data warehousing tasks.
