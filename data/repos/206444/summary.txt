Apache Hive is a data warehouse software system built on Apache Hadoop that enables SQL-based querying and analysis of large datasets stored in distributed file systems like HDFS and HBase. Primarily serving the big data analytics domain, it translates HiveQL (SQL-like) queries into MapReduce or Apache Tez jobs for execution across Hadoop clusters. The system addresses the challenge of making big data accessible to analysts and data engineers familiar with SQL, eliminating the need to write complex MapReduce code for data warehousing tasks including ETL operations, reporting, and batch analytics. Target users include data engineers, data analysts, and big data practitioners who need to perform scalable data processing and analysis on petabyte-scale datasets using familiar SQL syntax within the Hadoop ecosystem.
