`supabase/realtime` is a server application built with Elixir and the Phoenix Framework, designed to provide real-time functionality for web applications, particularly within the Supabase ecosystem. It offers features including broadcasting ephemeral messages, tracking and synchronizing shared client state (presence), and listening to and relaying PostgreSQL database changes via WebSockets. This project functions as a standalone server application providing a real-time backend, with client libraries available for JavaScript and Dart. Its architecture leverages Elixir's concurrency features and the Phoenix Framework for building scalable, real-time communication infrastructure, tightly integrated with a PostgreSQL database.
