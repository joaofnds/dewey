Supabase Realtime is an Elixir-based WebSocket server built on the Phoenix Framework that provides real-time data synchronization capabilities for web and mobile applications. It serves three core functions: Broadcast for low-latency ephemeral messaging between clients, Presence for tracking and synchronizing shared state across distributed clients using CRDT techniques, and Postgres Changes for streaming database change data capture (CDC) events to authorized clients. The system implements a multi-tenant architecture with JWT-based authentication and integrates directly with PostgreSQL databases to capture and distribute row-level changes via WebSockets. Targeted at full-stack developers building collaborative applications, real-time dashboards, or multiplayer experiences, it addresses the complex challenge of maintaining synchronized state across distributed web clients while providing scalable pub/sub messaging infrastructure for modern reactive applications.
