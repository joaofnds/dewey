oapi-codegen is a Go-based code generation tool that automatically converts OpenAPI 3.0 specifications into idiomatic Go code for web API development. It generates server-side boilerplate, client libraries, and HTTP models from REST API specifications, eliminating manual implementation overhead for Go developers building microservices and web applications. The tool focuses on producing simple, maintainable Go code that closely follows OpenAPI 3.x standards while working within Go's type system constraints. Primary users are backend Go developers and DevOps engineers who need to rapidly scaffold REST API implementations or integrate with existing OpenAPI-documented services, allowing them to focus on business logic rather than HTTP routing and marshaling boilerplate code.
