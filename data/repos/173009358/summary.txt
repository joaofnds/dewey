`oapi-codegen` is a Go command-line tool and library designed for generating Go code from OpenAPI 3 specifications, primarily targeting REST API development. It enables the creation of Go clients, server boilerplate for various frameworks (including Chi, Echo, Fiber, Gin, Gorilla/Mux, Iris, and net/http), and data models, streamlining the integration or development of services conforming to OpenAPI standards. Key functionalities include generating idiomatic Go code, supporting OpenAPI 3.x features, and providing options for custom code generation through user-defined templates, making it a developer productivity tool for building API-driven applications in Go. This project is a CLI tool and library intended for Go developers working with REST APIs.
