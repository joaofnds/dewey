Prettier is an opinionated code formatter designed for web development teams that automatically enforces consistent coding style across multiple programming languages and markup formats. Built in JavaScript, it parses source code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and reprints it according to predefined formatting rules, handling line length constraints and code wrapping. The tool supports a comprehensive range of web technologies including JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, CSS/SCSS/Less, HTML, Vue, Angular, GraphQL, Markdown, and YAML. Prettier integrates into developer workflows through editor plugins, pre-commit hooks, and CI/CD pipelines, eliminating manual code formatting discussions and style inconsistencies. It targets frontend and fullstack developers working in modern web development environments who need automated code style enforcement without configuration overhead.
