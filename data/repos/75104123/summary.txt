Prettier is a JavaScript-based, opinionated code formatter designed to enforce consistent code style across various languages and file types. It parses code, including JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, JSON, CSS, SCSS, Less, HTML, Vue, Angular, GraphQL, Markdown, and YAML, and automatically re-prints it with predefined rules, adapting to line length constraints. This standalone CLI tool and library, intended for developer productivity, integrates with editors, pre-commit hooks, and CI environments to automate code formatting. The project's core functionality centers on standardization, providing a unified code style without manual review or intervention.
