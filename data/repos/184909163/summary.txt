yabai is a C-based tiling window manager specifically designed for macOS that implements binary space partitioning algorithms to automatically organize application windows. Built as an extension to macOS's native window management system, it provides programmatic control over windows, spaces, and displays through a command-line interface and integrates with keyboard shortcut utilities like skhd. The tool targets power users, developers, and system administrators seeking efficient workspace management on macOS by eliminating manual window arrangement. It leverages macOS Accessibility APIs and optionally requires System Integrity Protection modifications for advanced window server control, addressing the productivity needs of users who prefer keyboard-driven, automated window layouts over traditional mouse-based window management.
