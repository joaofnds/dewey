RMagick is a Ruby C++ extension library that provides native bindings to ImageMagick, the open-source image processing toolkit. It enables Ruby developers to programmatically manipulate images through a comprehensive API that wraps ImageMagick's functionality, including image resizing, format conversion, filtering, compositing, and advanced image transformations. The library targets web developers, graphics programmers, and Ruby application developers who need server-side image processing capabilities in their applications. RMagick supports cross-platform deployment on Linux, macOS, Windows, and BSD systems, requiring Ruby 3.0+, a C++ compiler, and ImageMagick 6.8.9+ or 7.0.8+. It solves the critical need for robust image manipulation in Ruby applications without requiring external command-line tools, making it essential for content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and web applications that handle user-generated images or automated graphics processing workflows.
