Penrose is a TypeScript-based platform designed for creating publication-quality diagrams from plain text notation, specifically targeting the domains of mathematics, visualization, and scientific communication. It utilizes a domain-specific language (DSL) approach, enabling users to define domain, substance (data), and style programs to generate visual representations. Key features include the ability to specify diagrams via declarative code, and generate complex visuals from simple notation. The project appears to be a web-based application or a library intended to be integrated into a web application, focused on facilitating diagram creation for both technical and non-technical users.
