Penrose is a TypeScript-based domain-specific language platform for programmatic diagram generation, primarily targeting mathematical visualization and educational content creation. The system uses a three-tier architecture comprising Domain (type definitions), Substance (declarative relationships), and Style (visual constraints) languages to transform plain-text mathematical notation into SVG diagrams. Built for academics, educators, and technical documentation creators, Penrose employs constraint-based layout optimization to automatically generate high-quality visualizations for domains like set theory, linear algebra, and geometric proofs. The platform operates as both a web-based editor and programmatic API, solving the problem of creating consistent, publication-ready mathematical diagrams without manual drawing tools or complex graphics programming.
