containerd is an industry-standard container runtime daemon written in Go that manages the complete container lifecycle including image transfer, storage, execution, and supervision for Linux and Windows systems. Operating in the DevOps and cloud infrastructure domain, it serves as a core component of the container orchestration stack, designed to be embedded into larger systems like Kubernetes rather than used directly by developers. The runtime implements OCI (Open Container Initiative) standards and CRI (Container Runtime Interface) specifications, interfacing with lower-level components like runc for container execution and providing APIs for higher-level orchestrators. As a CNCF graduated project, it targets platform engineers, system administrators, and container orchestration developers who need reliable, production-grade container runtime capabilities with emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability across cloud-native infrastructure deployments.
