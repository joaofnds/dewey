gomarkov is a Go library implementing Markov chain text generation for natural language processing applications. Built for data scientists and NLP developers, it provides order-configurable Markov models that learn statistical patterns from training text to generate probabilistically similar sequences. The library supports transition probability calculations, seed-based text generation, and JSON serialization for model persistence. Core functionality includes training on tokenized text data, calculating n-gram transition probabilities, and generating new text sequences based on learned patterns. Examples demonstrate practical applications including gibberish detection, fake news generation, and name generation systems. The implementation targets developers working on text generation, language modeling, and content synthesis projects requiring lightweight probabilistic text generation without external ML framework dependencies.
