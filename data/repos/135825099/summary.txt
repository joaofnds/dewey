`gomarkov` is a Go library providing an implementation of Markov chains for processing textual data. It allows users to train a Markov chain model with textual input and then generate new text sequences based on the learned probabilities. Key functionalities include calculating transition probabilities between text sequences and generating new text from a seed. The library supports JSON serialization of the Markov chain model and offers example applications, including gibberish username detection, a fake news generator, and a Pokemon name generator. It's designed as a reusable library for developers working with natural language processing tasks in Go.
