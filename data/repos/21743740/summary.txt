Phoenix is a macOS desktop automation tool that provides JavaScript-based scripting capabilities for window and application management. Built in Objective-C, it targets power users and system administrators who need programmatic control over their macOS workspace. The application runs as a lightweight status bar utility or background daemon, exposing APIs for keyboard shortcut binding, window manipulation, screen management, space control, and system event handling. Users write configuration scripts in JavaScript (or TypeScript) to automate window tiling, application switching, and workspace organization tasks. Phoenix addresses the need for customizable window management on macOS, serving developers and productivity-focused users who prefer code-based configuration over GUI-based window managers, requiring macOS 10.14+ and accessibility permissions for UI automation.
