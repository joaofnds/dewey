The microsoft/vscode-icons repository serves as the centralized icon library for Visual Studio Code, providing a comprehensive collection of SVG icons used throughout the IDE's user interface. Targeting web developers, software engineers, and IDE contributors, this repository maintains both light and dark theme variants of icons covering functional areas including debugging (breakpoints, step controls), version control (git operations), file management, navigation arrows, and editor features. The icons are stored as scalable SVG files organized in theme-specific directories, enabling consistent visual design across VSCode's interface elements. This asset repository supports the broader Visual Studio Code ecosystem by providing standardized iconography for core IDE functionality, extensions, and third-party integrations, with Figma integration for design workflow management.
