HashiCorp Nomad is a workload orchestrator written in Go designed for DevOps and infrastructure management domains. It provides cluster scheduling and resource management for heterogeneous workloads including Docker containers, legacy applications, virtual machines, and batch jobs across on-premises and cloud environments. The system operates as a distributed, single-binary deployment tool that handles automatic failover, leader election, and state replication without requiring external dependencies. Nomad integrates natively with HashiCorp's ecosystem (Terraform, Consul, Vault) and supports advanced features like GPU scheduling, multi-region federation, and pluggable task drivers. It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and platform teams managing large-scale infrastructure deployments requiring flexible workload orchestration beyond traditional container-only solutions like Kubernetes.
