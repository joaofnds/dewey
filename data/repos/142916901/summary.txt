HTM (Hyperscript Tagged Markup) is a JavaScript library that enables JSX-like syntax in web development without requiring transpilation or build tools. It leverages ES6 tagged template literals to provide a runtime alternative to JSX for creating virtual DOM structures, primarily targeting React and Preact applications. The library binds to hyperscript-compatible functions (h(type, props, children)) and supports standard JSX features like components, props spreading, and fragments while adding HTML-style syntax improvements. At under 600 bytes, HTM addresses the need for component-based UI development in browsers without Babel/webpack compilation steps, making it ideal for rapid prototyping, CDN-based development, and scenarios where build complexity must be minimized while maintaining modern React/Preact development patterns.
