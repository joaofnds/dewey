`htm` is a JavaScript library providing a JSX-like syntax for creating user interfaces using standard tagged template literals, eliminating the need for a transpiler. It allows developers to write components and HTML structures directly in JavaScript, making it suitable for use with frameworks like React and Preact, or with other virtual DOM implementations.  Key features include support for component references, spread props, self-closing tags, and HTML-style comments.  This library is primarily a developer productivity tool aimed at frontend developers looking for a concise and tooling-light alternative to JSX, enabling direct browser-based development or efficient integration with build systems via a Babel plugin.
