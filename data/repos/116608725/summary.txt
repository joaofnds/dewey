Talltale is a Clojure/ClojureScript fake data generation library designed for software testing and development workflows. It provides comprehensive generators for realistic test data including persons, companies, addresses, and various other entities with locale support (English/French). The library integrates seamlessly with clojure.spec and test.check generators, offering both direct function calls and generator objects for property-based testing. Built on Java Time (replacing Joda Time) for date handling, it addresses the common development need for consistent, realistic mock data during prototyping, load testing, and unit testing phases. Target users are Clojure/ClojureScript developers working on web applications, APIs, and data processing systems who require structured fake data generation without manual test data creation, supporting both JVM and JavaScript runtime environments.
