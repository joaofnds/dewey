`undotree` is a Vim plugin designed to visualize and facilitate navigation through the undo history of Vim edits. Written in Vim Script, it presents a tree-like representation of undo branches, allowing users to easily browse and switch between different states of a file, even after edits have diverged. Key functionalities include the ability to toggle the undo tree panel, display change sequence numbers and timestamps, and persist undo history using Vim's built-in persistent undo feature, optionally enabling persistent undo saving across editing sessions. It functions as a plugin to enhance the Vim editor, improving developer productivity.
