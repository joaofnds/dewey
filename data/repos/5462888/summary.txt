Undotree is a Vim Script plugin that provides visual navigation and management of Vim's non-linear undo history tree structure. Targeting software developers and text editor power users, it solves the problem of accessing divergent undo branches that occur when edits are made after undoing previous changes, which traditional linear undo systems cannot handle. The plugin renders Vim's internal undo tree as an interactive sidebar interface, allowing users to browse, visualize, and switch between different historical states of their files without data loss. Built entirely in Vim Script for cross-platform compatibility, it integrates with Vim's persistent undo feature to maintain edit history across sessions, functioning as a lightweight buffer manipulation tool that enhances the native editing workflow for developers working with complex codebases requiring granular version control at the file level.
