This is an educational web application that provides interactive, step-by-step visualization of the SHA-256 cryptographic hashing algorithm. Built with React and JavaScript using create-react-app, the platform serves the cybersecurity education and computer science learning domains by breaking down the complex mathematical operations of SHA-256 into digestible visual components. The application targets computer science students, cryptography learners, and developers seeking to understand hash function internals rather than just implementation. It addresses the common challenge of learning cryptographic algorithms through abstract mathematical descriptions by providing hands-on, visual demonstration of message preprocessing, round functions, and bit operations that comprise SHA-256 computation, making this fundamental security primitive more accessible to educational audiences.
