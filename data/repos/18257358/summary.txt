`kcat` is a command-line tool providing a generic producer and consumer for Apache Kafka, functioning as a "netcat" for Kafka. Written in C and built upon `librdkafka`, it supports message production from standard input, consumption from topics, and metadata listing for Kafka clusters. Key features include support for high-level balanced consumer groups, Avro message deserialization via Confluent Schema-Registry, and various message formatting and transformation options. It is a standalone application, offering a lightweight alternative to JVM-based Kafka tools and is easily deployed using Docker.
