kcat is a lightweight, non-JVM command-line tool for Apache Kafka that functions as a generic producer and consumer for Kafka clusters. Built in C and statically linked to just 150KB, it serves as a "netcat for Kafka" enabling DevOps engineers and system administrators to quickly produce messages from stdin to Kafka topics, consume messages to stdout, and inspect cluster metadata. The tool supports Kafka >=0.8 features including high-level balanced consumers, transactional producers, Avro deserialization via Confluent Schema Registry, and various message formats. It leverages librdkafka for Kafka protocol implementation and targets infrastructure teams needing fast, dependency-free Kafka operations for debugging, monitoring, data pipeline testing, and log streaming without requiring JVM overhead or complex application setup.
