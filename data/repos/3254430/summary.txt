multiple-cursors.el is an Emacs Lisp extension that implements simultaneous multi-cursor editing functionality for the Emacs text editor. Targeting software developers and power users who work extensively in Emacs, it enables simultaneous text manipulation across multiple cursor positions within a buffer through commands like `mc/mark-next-like-this` and `mc/edit-lines`. The package leverages Emacs Lisp's overlay system and hooks to synchronize editing operations across multiple regions, solving the problem of repetitive text editing tasks such as refactoring variable names or making similar edits across multiple lines. It integrates with Emacs' region selection and keyboard macro systems, providing both interactive commands and programmatic interfaces for batch text operations, significantly improving editing efficiency for code and document manipulation workflows.
