`multiple-cursors.el` is an Emacs Lisp library providing advanced multiple-cursor editing functionality, enabling users to simultaneously edit multiple locations within a buffer. It allows users to add and manage multiple cursors for operations like marking similar text, manipulating lines, and performing bulk edits across multiple regions. Key features include commands for marking occurrences of text, adding cursors on click, and managing cursor positions, with bindings for common operations. This project functions as an Emacs extension, significantly enhancing developer productivity within the Emacs text editor.
