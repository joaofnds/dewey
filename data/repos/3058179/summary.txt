bbswitch is a Linux kernel module designed for power management in laptops with NVIDIA Optimus hybrid graphics configurations. It provides automated ACPI-based control to disable discrete NVIDIA GPUs when not in use, significantly reducing power consumption and heat generation. The module automatically detects the correct ACPI calls for both "real" and "legacy" Optimus implementations, includes safeguards to prevent driver conflicts with nouveau/nvidia drivers, and handles suspend/resume cycles appropriately. It exposes a `/proc/acpi/bbswitch` interface for runtime GPU state management and supports DKMS for kernel upgrade persistence. Targeted at Linux system administrators and power users with Optimus laptops, bbswitch solves the critical problem of excessive battery drain caused by always-on discrete graphics cards in dual-GPU laptop systems.
