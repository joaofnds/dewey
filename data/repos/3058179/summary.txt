bbswitch is a kernel module written in C designed to automatically disable discrete Nvidia graphics cards on Optimus laptops. It enables and disables the card based on ACPI calls and prevents driver conflicts during shutdown and resume, offering options for boot-time and shutdown configurations.  Key functionality includes detecting the correct ACPI handle, providing safeguards against driver interference, and allowing users to control the card's power state through `/proc/acpi/bbswitch` and module options. This is a kernel module intended for system administrators and users seeking to optimize power consumption and manage graphics card usage on supported Optimus laptops.
