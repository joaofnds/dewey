This repository provides a macOS Terminal.app color scheme implementation of the Solarized color palette, specifically adapted for OS X 10.7+ Terminal application. It targets developers, system administrators, and command-line users who work extensively in terminal environments and seek improved visual ergonomics through carefully calibrated color schemes. The repository contains terminal preference files that implement Ethan Schoonover's original Solarized design with precise L*a*b color values converted to sRGB space for accurate display. It addresses the common problem of eye strain and poor readability in default terminal color schemes by providing a scientifically-designed 16-color palette optimized for both light and dark backgrounds. The implementation serves the developer tools and productivity domain, enhancing the command-line interface experience for programming, system administration, and DevOps workflows on macOS systems.
