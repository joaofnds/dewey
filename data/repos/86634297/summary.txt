Grid Garden is an interactive web-based educational game designed to teach CSS Grid layout concepts through gamified learning. Built with JavaScript, the application targets web developers and frontend engineers learning modern CSS layout techniques. The game presents progressive levels where users write CSS Grid properties to solve visual puzzles, reinforcing practical understanding of grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-area, and other CSS Grid specifications. Deployed as a static web application with extensive internationalization support across 35+ languages, it addresses the learning curve associated with CSS Grid adoption in modern web development. The codebase includes modular JavaScript files for level management, documentation, and multilingual messaging, making CSS Grid concepts accessible to developers worldwide through hands-on practice rather than traditional documentation-based learning.
