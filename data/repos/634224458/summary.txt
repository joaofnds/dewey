`gpt-engineer` is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) platform designed to experiment with code generation using large language models (LLMs). It enables users to specify software requirements in natural language, allowing an AI to autonomously write, execute, and iteratively improve code. Key functionalities include codebase generation, improvement of existing codebases based on natural language prompts, and benchmarking of custom coding agents against established datasets. The project supports integration with OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and local or open-source LLMs, targeting developers interested in exploring and utilizing AI-driven code generation tools.
