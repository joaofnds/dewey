Macterial is a GTK+ desktop theme that combines macOS visual design principles with Google's Material Design language, implemented entirely in CSS. This theming solution targets Linux desktop environments and window managers that support GTK+ theming, specifically addressing the need for cohesive visual styling across GNOME applications and GTK-based software. The theme provides comprehensive styling for UI components including windows, buttons, menus, and form elements, creating a unified desktop appearance that blends Apple's interface aesthetics with Material Design's color schemes and visual hierarchy. It serves Linux desktop users, system customizers, and desktop environment enthusiasts who want to achieve a modern, polished interface design that deviates from default GTK themes while maintaining usability standards.
