Dapr is a distributed application runtime built in Go that provides a sidecar architecture for microservices development across cloud and edge environments. It abstracts complex distributed system patterns through standardized HTTP/gRPC APIs, offering built-in capabilities for pub/sub messaging, state management, service invocation, workflow orchestration, and secret management. The runtime operates as a CNCF graduated project targeting platform engineers and application developers building event-driven microservices architectures on Kubernetes, serverless platforms, or standalone deployments. Dapr solves distributed computing challenges like service discovery, reliable messaging, state consistency, and cross-service communication through pluggable components that integrate with cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP) and infrastructure services like Redis, enabling language-agnostic distributed application development without vendor lock-in.
