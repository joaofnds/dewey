Apache Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database designed for managing large amounts of data across many commodity servers. It provides high availability with no single point of failure, supporting features like data replication, tunable consistency, and linear scalability. Built using Java, Cassandra allows for flexible schema design and is intended for applications requiring high write throughput and fault tolerance, such as those used for time-series data and online applications.
