Apache Cassandra is a distributed NoSQL database system implementing a partitioned row store architecture for managing large-scale data across multiple nodes. Built in Java with CQL (Cassandra Query Language) as its SQL-like interface, it serves enterprise applications requiring high availability, horizontal scalability, and fault tolerance. The system automatically handles data partitioning, replication, and cluster management as nodes are added or removed, making it suitable for web applications, IoT platforms, and real-time analytics workloads that demand consistent performance under heavy read/write operations. Target users include backend developers, database administrators, and DevOps engineers building distributed systems that need to handle massive datasets with minimal downtime and linear scalability.
