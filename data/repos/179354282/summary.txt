OpenCorePkg is a UEFI-based bootloader specifically designed for macOS systems, targeting the hackintosh community and Apple hardware enthusiasts. Written in C, it provides a comprehensive SDK with libraries for Apple-specific UEFI functionality including disk image loading, PE signature verification, secure boot implementation, ACPI/SMBIOS manipulation, and XNU kernel driver injection. The project serves as a modern replacement for legacy bootloaders like Chameleon and Clover, offering advanced features such as cryptographic primitives, audio management with accessibility support, overflow-safe arithmetic operations, and plist configuration parsing. It primarily addresses system administrators, enthusiasts, and developers who need to boot macOS on non-Apple hardware or require low-level system modifications, providing essential tools for UEFI firmware interaction and macOS compatibility layer implementation.
