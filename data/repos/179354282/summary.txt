OpenCorePkg is a C-based bootloader with a development SDK, designed for UEFI-based systems. It provides core functionality for system initialization and management, including Apple-specific UEFI driver support, such as disk image loading, keyboard input aggregation, PE image signature verification, secure boot components, and ACPI/SMBIOS manipulation. This project offers supplemental libraries for cryptographic primitives, decompression, file and string abstractions, plist parsing, and XNU kernel driver injection. It appears to be a library set and SDK targeting developers and enthusiasts involved in system customization and macOS/Hackintosh-related projects.
