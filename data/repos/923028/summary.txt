Rails ERD is a Ruby gem specifically designed for Rails web application developers to automatically generate Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) from Active Record models. It leverages Active Record's reflection capabilities to analyze model associations and relationships, then uses Graphviz to render visual database schema diagrams in various formats (PDF, PNG, etc.). The tool addresses the common problem of maintaining up-to-date database documentation in Rails applications by programmatically extracting relationship metadata and converting it into standardized ERD notation. Supporting Rails versions 3.0-5.0, it provides both command-line interface and programmatic API for customization, enabling Rails developers to visualize complex database schemas, document application architecture, and inspect domain models without manual diagram creation or maintenance overhead.
