This repository hosts the source code for "Oh Shit, Git!?!" (ohshitgit.com), a technical reference website that provides Git troubleshooting solutions and command examples for developers experiencing version control issues. Built using the Eleventy (11ty) static site generator with Nunjucks templating and deployed on Netlify, the site focuses on practical Git recovery scenarios with step-by-step command-line solutions. The codebase supports internationalization through language-specific directories, automated deployment via Netlify redirects, and maintains both profanity-inclusive and clean versions of content. Primary users are software developers, DevOps engineers, and technical professionals who need quick reference guides for resolving common Git repository problems, merge conflicts, and version control mistakes during development workflows.
