Charm is a Go-based backend-as-a-service toolkit designed for terminal and CLI application developers. It provides four core services: Charm KV (an encrypted, cloud-synced key-value store built on BadgerDB), Charm FS (a Go fs.FS compatible cloud filesystem), Charm Crypt (end-to-end encryption), and Charm Accounts (invisible user authentication). The platform operates through SSH and HTTP protocols, enabling developers to add cloud storage, user accounts, and data synchronization to command-line tools without managing traditional backend infrastructure. Originally offered as a hosted service (Charm Cloud, now sunset), it supports self-hosting and integrates with Charm Bracelet's ecosystem of TUI applications like Glow and Skate, targeting Go developers building modern terminal-based applications.
