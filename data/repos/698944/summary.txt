`Rack::Cors` is a JavaScript library providing Rack middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Rack-compatible web applications, facilitating cross-domain AJAX requests.  It allows configuration via Ruby code, supporting origin whitelisting using strings, regular expressions, or dynamic blocks, alongside controls for allowed HTTP methods, headers, response header exposure, credentials, and maximum age.  Primarily intended for use within Ruby on Rails and other Rack-based applications, the middleware is installed as a gem and configured via initializer or `config.ru` file. This is a library specifically for web application developers to manage CORS policies in their projects.
