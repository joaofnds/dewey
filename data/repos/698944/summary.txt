**rack-cors** is a Ruby Rack middleware that implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) functionality for web applications, enabling secure cross-domain AJAX requests without JSONP workarounds. Targeting web developers building APIs and single-page applications, it integrates seamlessly with Rails and other Rack-compatible frameworks through middleware configuration. The library provides granular control over CORS policies including origin validation (string, regex, or dynamic), HTTP method restrictions, header management, credential handling, and preflight request processing. It addresses the browser's same-origin policy limitations by setting appropriate CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, etc.), making it essential for developers creating RESTful APIs consumed by frontend applications hosted on different domains or ports.
