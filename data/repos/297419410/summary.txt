This repository provides configuration and Emacs Lisp code to integrate Cognitect's REBL (a Clojure data exploration tool) with CIDER (Clojure Interactive Development Environment for Emacs). It enables developers to selectively send and evaluate Clojure code expressions to REBL for inspection during CIDER-based development, contrasting with approaches that send all evaluations. Functionality includes sending the last sexp or the current defun/top-level form to REBL using keyboard shortcuts. The project incorporates Emacs Lisp for keybindings and configurations, utilizes `deps.edn` for dependency management (including REBL itself), and leverages `.dir-locals.el` for CIDER project-specific configurations, targeting Clojure developers working within the Emacs environment.
