This repository provides configuration and utilities for integrating Cognitect REBL (a Clojure data browser/inspector) with CIDER (Clojure IDE for Emacs) in Clojure development workflows. It addresses the incompatibility between nREPL and REBL by offering an alternative approach that allows selective evaluation of Clojure forms directly to REBL rather than sending all evaluations. The solution consists of Emacs Lisp functions, deps.edn aliases for both JDK8 and JDK11+, and directory-local configuration that enables developers to inspect specific S-expressions and top-level forms in REBL's visual interface using keyboard shortcuts. This setup targets Clojure developers using Emacs who want granular control over which code gets sent to REBL for debugging and data inspection, avoiding the noise of automatic form forwarding provided by existing nREPL middleware solutions.
