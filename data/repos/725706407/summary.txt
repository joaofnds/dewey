Dumbpipe is a Rust-based networking tool that creates encrypted QUIC tunnels between devices using iroh-net for NAT traversal and hole punching. Built for DevOps and systems administration, it functions as a modern alternative to netcat, enabling location-transparent connections via 256-bit node identifiers instead of IP addresses. The tool handles TCP port forwarding, stdin/stdout piping, and bi-directional data streaming with automatic relay fallback when direct connections fail. Primary use cases include forwarding development web servers across networks, streaming media between machines, and creating secure pipes for data transfer. Target users are developers, system administrators, and network engineers who need reliable peer-to-peer connectivity that bypasses traditional networking constraints while maintaining TLS encryption throughout the connection.
