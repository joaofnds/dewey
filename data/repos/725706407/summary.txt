`dumbpipe` is a Rust-based command-line application designed to establish secure, location-transparent network connections between devices, acting as a "dumb pipe" over QUIC using `iroh-net`. It facilitates hole punching and NAT traversal, falling back to relays when necessary, offering a mechanism for streaming data and forwarding TCP connections. Functionality includes integration with tools like `ffmpeg` for media streaming and features for sharing development web servers. It allows customization with Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) strings for interaction with other services like `iroh-bytes`, targeting developers seeking tools for creating secure and accessible network pipes.
