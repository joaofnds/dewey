The `ruby/ruby` repository hosts the source code for the Ruby programming language, an interpreted, object-oriented language primarily used for web development and scripting. It provides features like a simple syntax, object-oriented capabilities including mixins and singleton methods, operator overloading, exception handling, and garbage collection. Ruby is highly portable, supporting various operating systems. This project represents the core implementation of a programming language, targeted at developers and language enthusiasts, serving as the foundation for Ruby-based software development.
