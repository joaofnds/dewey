This repository contains the official implementation of the Ruby programming language interpreter, a dynamically-typed object-oriented language primarily implemented in C with JIT compilation capabilities and experimental Rust components. Ruby targets web developers, system administrators, and general-purpose programmers across Unix-like systems, Windows, and macOS platforms. The interpreter features garbage collection, dynamic loading, mixins, closures, and operator overloading, serving as the foundation for web frameworks like Rails and automation scripts. The codebase addresses the need for a simple yet powerful scripting language that balances developer productivity with system-level capabilities, supporting both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms for web development, DevOps automation, and general software development workflows.
