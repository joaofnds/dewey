Oban is a robust background job processing library for Elixir applications, designed for web development and distributed systems. Built on the Erlang/OTP platform, it leverages PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite3 databases as the job queue backend, eliminating the need for separate message brokers like Redis or RabbitMQ. The library provides transactional job enqueueing, isolated queue processing with configurable concurrency, CRON-based scheduling, job uniqueness constraints, and comprehensive observability through persistent job history and metrics. Targeting Elixir/Phoenix developers building scalable web applications, Oban solves the critical problem of reliable asynchronous task processing while maintaining ACID compliance and providing enterprise-grade features like job cancellation, priority queuing, and distributed coordination across multiple application nodes.
