`oj` is a high-performance JSON parser and object marshaller implemented as a C extension for Ruby. It provides fast parsing and dumping capabilities, offering multiple operational modes for strict JSON compliance, compatibility with the standard JSON gem, and Rails/ActiveSupport behavior. This library supports integration with `multi_json` and is intended for use in Ruby applications requiring efficient JSON processing, including Rails projects, and it can be installed as a Ruby gem. The project includes performance comparisons against other JSON parsers and object marshallers.
