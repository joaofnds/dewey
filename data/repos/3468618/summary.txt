Oj is a high-performance JSON parser and object marshaller implemented as a Ruby C extension, designed to optimize JSON processing performance for Ruby web applications and Rails development. The library provides significantly faster JSON parsing and generation compared to Ruby's standard JSON gem, offering multiple operation modes including strict JSON compliance, Rails/ActiveSupport compatibility, and custom object marshalling. Built with C for maximum speed, Oj integrates seamlessly with Ruby web frameworks, automatically replacing slower JSON processors in multi_json-based applications and providing drop-in compatibility with existing Rails JSON handling. The gem targets Ruby developers working on web applications, APIs, and data-intensive systems where JSON processing performance is critical, offering features like streaming parsing, custom serialization callbacks, and various encoding formats while maintaining compatibility across different Ruby and Rails versions.
