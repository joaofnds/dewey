`entr` is a command-line utility designed to execute arbitrary commands upon file changes, primarily targeting developer productivity. It leverages `kqueue(2)` on BSD/macOS and `inotify(7)` on Linux to monitor file system events efficiently, eliminating the need for polling. Core functionalities include triggering commands based on file modifications, supporting various shell command execution scenarios, and offering features like output filtering, automatic reloading, and handling symlinks through environment variables. This standalone C application facilitates rapid feedback loops during development and testing, with practical application examples for build automation and server auto-reloading.
