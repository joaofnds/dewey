entr is a C-based file monitoring utility that executes arbitrary commands when filesystem changes occur, leveraging platform-specific APIs like kqueue(2) on BSD/macOS and inotify(7) on Linux to avoid inefficient polling. Designed for development workflow automation and continuous integration pipelines, it serves DevOps engineers, web developers, and system administrators who need rapid feedback loops during development. The tool integrates seamlessly with build systems, test runners, and web servers, enabling automatic project rebuilds, server restarts, and test execution upon file modifications. Its lightweight architecture and cross-platform support make it particularly valuable for test automation, hot-reloading development servers, and continuous deployment workflows where file-based triggers drive automated processes.
