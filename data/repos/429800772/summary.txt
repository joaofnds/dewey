This repository provides a Neovim completion source plugin that integrates with nvim-cmp to display LSP (Language Server Protocol) function signature help during code completion. Written in Lua, it specifically targets software developers using Neovim as their primary editor for programming across various languages. The plugin enhances the coding experience by showing function signatures with highlighted current parameters directly in the completion menu, eliminating the need to reference separate documentation or signature popups. It leverages Neovim's built-in LSP client capabilities and extends the nvim-cmp completion framework to provide contextual function signature information inline. This addresses the common developer workflow challenge of remembering function parameters and their types while writing code, particularly beneficial for developers working with strongly-typed languages or complex APIs where function signatures contain multiple parameters.
