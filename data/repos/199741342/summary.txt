`salt` is a Clojure-based experimental tool designed to translate a subset of Clojure code into TLA+ specifications, facilitating the formal verification of system designs. It provides a REPL-based authoring experience, automated unit testing for invariants and actions, and automatic TLA+ code formatting.  The project functions as a library and command-line tool, enabling Clojure developers to leverage their existing knowledge for creating and assessing temporal properties using the TLA+ Toolbox. It utilizes Clojure for the specification language and TLA+ for the target formal language. This project is aimed at developers familiar with Clojure who need to write formal specifications.
