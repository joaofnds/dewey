`Expound` is a Clojure library designed to improve the readability of error messages generated by `clojure.spec`, a specification and validation library.  It transforms verbose, machine-oriented `clojure.spec` error outputs into human-readable formats, including tables and context-aware explanations of specification failures, enhancing developer productivity. Key functionalities include replacing `clojure.spec.alpha/explain` and `explain-str` with `expound.alpha/expound` and `expound-str`, respectively, and integrating with testing frameworks. This library, intended for Clojure developers using `clojure.spec` for data validation, provides a more user-friendly debugging experience.
