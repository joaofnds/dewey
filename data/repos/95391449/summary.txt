Expound is a Clojure/ClojureScript library that transforms cryptic `clojure.spec` validation error messages into human-readable, formatted output for improved developer experience. Built specifically for the Clojure ecosystem, it addresses the common pain point where spec validation failures produce technical error messages that are difficult to parse and understand during development. The library integrates seamlessly with existing spec workflows by replacing standard `explain` functions or setting the `*explain-out*` printer, providing enhanced error formatting with visual indicators, structured tables, and clear explanations of validation failures. Targeted at Clojure and ClojureScript developers working with data validation, API development, and functional programming applications, Expound supports both JVM Clojure and JavaScript environments including Node.js, browser-based development, and build tools like Leiningen and deps.edn, making spec-driven development more accessible and productive.
