MELPA is an Emacs Lisp package archive providing recipes and build machinery for a large collection of Emacs Lisp packages. It automatically builds packages from upstream source code, primarily using simple recipes that define package metadata and fetch instructions from various version control systems, including Git and Mercurial. Key functionalities include package building, versioning based on upstream commit dates, and distribution via an archive accessible through `package.el`. This project is a package repository specifically targeting Emacs users and developers, with a technology stack built around Emacs Lisp and interacting with Git/Mercurial repositories.
