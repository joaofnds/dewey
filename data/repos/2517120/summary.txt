MELPA is a centralized package repository and automated build system for the Emacs text editor ecosystem, serving as the primary distribution channel for Emacs Lisp packages. Built entirely in Emacs Lisp, it provides continuous integration infrastructure that automatically fetches, builds, and packages thousands of third-party Emacs extensions from various version control systems (Git, Mercurial) and code forges (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, SourceHut). The system uses recipe-based configuration files to define package metadata and build instructions, integrating with Emacs' native `package.el` package manager to enable seamless installation and dependency management. MELPA solves the fragmented distribution problem in the Emacs development community by providing a unified, automated publishing platform that eliminates manual packaging overhead for both package authors and end users, making it the de facto standard package repository for Emacs developers and power users.
