This repository provides a collection of custom desktop icons for Visual Studio Code, targeting developers who want to personalize their IDE's appearance on macOS, Windows, and Linux systems. The project delivers icon variations inspired by popular VSCode themes (Cobalt2, Dracula, SynthWave '84, Oceanic Next, City Lights) and includes retro-styled designs like vintage Apple Macintosh 1984 aesthetics. Built as a design-focused resource rather than a code extension, it addresses the customization needs of front-end developers, theme enthusiasts, and design-conscious programmers who use VSCode as their primary development environment. The icons are distributed as .icns and .png files with installation instructions for manual replacement of the default VSCode application icon across different operating systems, enhancing the visual development experience for web developers and software engineers.
