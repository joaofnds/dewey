This repository provides a PL/pgSQL function for calculating recurring event occurrences within PostgreSQL databases, targeting web application developers building calendar and scheduling systems. The function handles complex recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) with support for timezone conversion, DST adjustments, and flexible scheduling rules including separation intervals, occurrence limits, and end dates. It operates on a structured database schema with `events` and `event_recurrences` tables, returning precise timestamp ranges for event instances within specified date boundaries. The solution addresses the computational complexity of recurring event calculation by offloading processing to the database layer, making it ideal for calendar applications, booking systems, and event management platforms where developers need efficient server-side recurrence logic without client-side date manipulation overhead.
