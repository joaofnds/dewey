The `bakineggs/recurring_events_for` repository provides a PL/pgSQL function designed to calculate the occurrences of recurring events. It facilitates the determination of event schedules, likely targeting applications needing to manage and display repeating entries within the scope of a database backend. This functionality is encapsulated within a database function, indicating a library-like project that extends PostgreSQL's capabilities, likely intended for developers working with database-driven applications. The use of Ruby in relation to the project suggests potential integration or wrapper tooling surrounding the PL/pgSQL function, though this is less clear.
