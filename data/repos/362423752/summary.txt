which-key.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides contextual keymap discovery and assistance for text editor users. It displays interactive popup windows showing available key bindings as users type key combinations, helping developers remember and discover keyboard shortcuts across different Neovim modes (normal, insert, visual, operator-pending, terminal, command). The plugin integrates with the Neovim ecosystem through lua-based configuration, supports multiple display layouts (classic, modern, helix), and includes built-in modules for marks, registers, spelling suggestions, and text objects. It targets software developers and power users who utilize Neovim as their primary code editor, solving the cognitive overhead of memorizing complex key combinations in modal editing environments by providing real-time, contextual help systems.
