Linuxbrew/brew is a package manager, derived from Homebrew, designed for Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Its core functionality is to facilitate the installation and management of software packages that may not be available through the host operating system's package manager, or to provide more up-to-date versions. Built primarily in Ruby, it enables installation to a user's home directory, mitigating the need for sudo access, and utilizes a separate repository for formulae. This standalone command-line application targets system administrators and developers seeking a consistent package management experience across macOS, Linux, and Windows environments.
