Linuxbrew is a Ruby-based package manager that ports the Homebrew ecosystem to Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environments. It enables system administrators and developers to install and manage software packages in userspace without requiring sudo privileges, addressing the common problem of outdated or missing packages in Linux distributions. The tool compiles packages from source or uses pre-built binaries (bottles), maintaining its own dependency chain including glibc and gcc when necessary. Linuxbrew targets DevOps engineers, Linux developers, and system administrators who need consistent package management across macOS and Linux systems, particularly in environments where users lack root access or need newer software versions than those provided by distribution repositories. The project has since merged into the main Homebrew codebase.
