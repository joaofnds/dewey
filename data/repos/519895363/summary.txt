Sniffnet is a cross-platform, GUI-based network monitoring and analysis application written in Rust. It facilitates real-time inspection of internet traffic, offering features like packet capture, protocol identification, traffic statistics visualization, and host information lookup (domain, ASN, geolocation). Utilizing the `iced` GUI framework, the application provides an intuitive interface for users to monitor network activity, identify potential security threats, and export capture reports in PCAP format. The project is designed as a standalone utility tool, targeting users interested in network analysis, security, and system monitoring across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
