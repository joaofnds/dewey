Sniffnet is a cross-platform network monitoring and packet analysis application built in Rust using the Iced GUI framework. It provides real-time Internet traffic monitoring capabilities through packet capture (pcap) technology, targeting network administrators, security professionals, and system administrators who need to analyze network communications. The application features a desktop GUI for visualizing network traffic patterns, inspecting packet details, and monitoring connection statistics across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. It serves the network security and system administration domain by offering an intuitive alternative to command-line packet sniffers like Wireshark or tcpdump, enabling users to comfortably observe and analyze their network traffic for troubleshooting, security auditing, and bandwidth monitoring purposes without requiring deep command-line expertise.
