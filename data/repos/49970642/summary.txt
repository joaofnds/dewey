Yarn is a JavaScript package manager designed as an alternative to npm for Node.js and web development projects. Built in JavaScript, it provides dependency management for JavaScript applications with enhanced performance, reliability, and security features. The tool addresses common npm limitations through deterministic lockfile-based installations, concurrent package downloads with caching, offline installation capabilities, and checksum-based package integrity verification. Yarn targets JavaScript developers, frontend engineers, and Node.js developers who need reliable dependency resolution and faster package installation workflows. This repository contains the legacy 1.x codebase (now frozen), while active development has moved to the Berry project for modern Yarn versions with features like Plug'n'Play module resolution and alternative node_modules strategies.
