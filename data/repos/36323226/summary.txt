Tokei is a high-performance command-line code analysis tool written in Rust that provides statistical analysis of codebases across 150+ programming languages. It counts lines of code (SLOC), comments, and blank lines while accurately handling complex syntax patterns like nested comments and string literals. The tool targets software developers, DevOps engineers, and project managers who need rapid codebase metrics for project assessment, CI/CD pipelines, and repository analysis. Tokei outputs results in multiple formats (JSON, YAML, CBOR) for integration with automated workflows and supports cross-platform deployment on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It serves as both a standalone CLI utility and a Rust library for embedding code statistics functionality into larger development tools and build systems.
