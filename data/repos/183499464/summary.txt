Release Please is a TypeScript-based automation tool designed for DevOps and CI/CD workflows that generates release pull requests by parsing git commit history for Conventional Commit messages. Targeted at software development teams managing GitHub repositories, it automates semantic versioning, CHANGELOG generation, and GitHub release creation without handling package publication or complex branch management. The tool follows the conventionalcommits.org specification to determine version bumps (patch for fixes, minor for features, major for breaking changes) and maintains persistent release PRs that update automatically as new commits are merged. It serves developers and release managers who need standardized, automated release processes while maintaining control over when releases are actually published through PR merge workflows.
