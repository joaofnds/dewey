`release-please` is a TypeScript-based developer tool that automates software release processes by generating release pull requests based on the conventionalcommits.org specification. It parses Git history for conventional commit messages (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`) to determine version bumps and automatically updates changelogs and creates GitHub releases upon merging the release PR. Supported release types cover various programming languages and project structures, including Node.js, Java, Python, and Go, enabling automated versioning for diverse software projects and targeting developers streamlining their software release workflows.
