The `go-plugin` repository provides a production-grade RPC-based plugin system for Go applications, enabling process isolation and cross-language plugin development. Primarily targeting DevOps and infrastructure tooling (used extensively in HashiCorp's Terraform, Vault, Nomad, and Packer), it implements plugin communication via standard net/rpc and gRPC protocols over local networks. The system allows plugins to be separate subprocess binaries while maintaining Go interface semantics, supporting complex bidirectional communication, connection multiplexing via yamux, protocol versioning, and cryptographic security. It solves the critical problem of extending application functionality without risking host process crashes, making it ideal for infrastructure automation engineers and platform developers building extensible CLI tools and infrastructure management systems.
