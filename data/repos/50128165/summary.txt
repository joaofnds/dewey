`go-plugin` is a Go library providing a plugin system built upon RPC for extending applications. It facilitates the creation of plugins implemented as Go interfaces, enabling cross-language plugin support via gRPC, complex argument handling, bidirectional communication, and built-in features like logging and protocol versioning. This library, central to several HashiCorp tools, allows plugin developers to create plugins using Go and other languages that can be easily installed, with enhanced security via TLS and checksum validation, targeting developers looking to extend Go-based applications with modular and isolated components. This library is a plugin system (framework/library).
