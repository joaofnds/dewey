Consul is a distributed service networking platform built in Go that provides service discovery, service mesh, and API gateway capabilities for modern infrastructure. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform architects, it solves service connectivity and configuration challenges in dynamic, multi-datacenter environments including Kubernetes, ECS, and traditional VM deployments. The platform implements health checking, automatic TLS encryption, identity-based authorization, and transparent proxy functionality to enable secure service-to-service communication. Consul integrates with HashiCorp Vault for secrets management and provides both DNS and HTTP interfaces for service registration and discovery, making it essential infrastructure tooling for organizations managing distributed applications across hybrid cloud environments.
