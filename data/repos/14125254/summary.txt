Consul is a distributed service mesh solution, written in Go, designed for connecting and configuring applications across dynamic, distributed infrastructure. It provides key features including service discovery via DNS or HTTP, health checking to prevent traffic routing to unhealthy hosts, API gateway capabilities for managing access within the service mesh, and service-to-service communication with automatic TLS encryption. The project facilitates multi-datacenter deployments and supports dynamic application configuration through an HTTP API, targeting system administrators and developers building and managing cloud-native applications within Kubernetes, ECS, and similar environments. This is a standalone application.
