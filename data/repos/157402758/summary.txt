Portmaster is an open-source application firewall written in Go that provides granular network traffic control and privacy protection for Windows and Linux desktops. It integrates into the network stack using nfqueue/eBPF on Linux and WFP kernel drivers on Windows to intercept packets at the raw level, enabling per-application network monitoring and blocking capabilities. The system combines DNS-over-HTTPS/TLS secure DNS resolution, malware/tracker filtering, connection ownership tracking via process monitoring, and an optional multi-hop privacy network (SPN) with onion encryption. Target users include privacy-conscious system administrators, security professionals, and end-users seeking application-level firewall control beyond traditional network firewalls, addressing surveillance concerns and providing detailed network visibility with local data processing and automatic threat intelligence updates.
