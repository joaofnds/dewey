Portmaster is a Go-based, open-source application firewall and privacy suite designed to enhance user privacy by controlling and monitoring network activity. It functions as a desktop application, providing features like comprehensive network activity monitoring, granular control over network traffic through blocking rules, secure DNS (DoT/DoH) resolution, and automatic blocking of trackers and malware.  Built for Windows and Linux, it integrates with the network stack via kernel drivers and eBPF/`/proc` mechanisms, offering per-application settings and supporting special process types. The project includes a paid "Safing Privacy Network" (SPN), a privacy-focused routing service akin to a VPN.
