This repository provides a comprehensive collection of 67+ visual themes for GNU Emacs text editor, implemented in Emacs Lisp. Primarily targeting software developers and Emacs users, it serves the development tools and IDE customization domain by offering color schemes and visual styling options for code editing environments. The themes are specifically optimized for Doom Emacs configuration framework and include integration support for popular Emacs packages like treemacs, neotree, org-mode, and solaire-mode. It addresses the need for consistent, aesthetically pleasing coding environments by porting popular themes from other editors (VSCode, Atom, Sublime Text) and creating original designs. The package is distributed through MELPA and uses use-package for configuration, solving the problem of limited visual customization options in Emacs while maintaining syntax highlighting compatibility across different programming languages and modes.
