Lisp in Life is a Lisp interpreter implemented within Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton, demonstrating Turing completeness through practical computation. Built with C as the base implementation, it uses VarLife (8-state cellular automaton) as an intermediate layer before conversion to Conway's Game of Life patterns via OTCA metapixels. The system features a complete computer architecture with CPU, ROM, RAM modules, and supports advanced Lisp features including lexical closures and macros. Input programs are encoded as ASCII within specific cells, with output displayed in the RAM module. This project targets computer science researchers, cellular automaton enthusiasts, and developers interested in esoteric programming languages, solving the theoretical challenge of implementing high-level language interpretation in a minimal computational substrate while proving Conway's Game of Life's computational universality.
