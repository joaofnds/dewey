`woodrush/lisp-in-life` is a research project demonstrating a Lisp interpreter implemented within Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton. The project allows users to write and execute Lisp programs, including lexical closures and macros, by encoding them as patterns within the Game of Life environment; the interpreter is written in C and compiled for a custom CPU architecture also implemented within the Game of Life. This standalone project utilizes the Quest For Tetris (QFT) project's architecture and VarLife intermediate representation for compact implementation, showcasing Turing completeness and offering a unique perspective on computation within a simple rule set.
