Written in Go, it provides features like global metric views, cheap and durable object storage integration (e.g., S3), and high availability through data replication, addressing the scalability limitations of single Prometheus instances. This standalone application facilitates the collection, storage, and querying of time-series data, targeting system administrators and DevOps engineers focused on observability and monitoring.
