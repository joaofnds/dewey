Grafana Mimir is a horizontally scalable, multi-tenant time series database designed for long-term Prometheus metrics storage in DevOps and observability infrastructure. Built in Go, it addresses the limitations of single Prometheus instances by providing distributed storage across multiple nodes, supporting up to 1 billion active time series through horizontal scaling. The system leverages object storage backends (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) for cost-effective long-term persistence while maintaining high availability through data replication. Mimir integrates with the Prometheus ecosystem, OpenTelemetry, and OTLP protocols, enabling aggregated queries across multiple Prometheus instances. It targets platform engineers, SRE teams, and DevOps professionals managing large-scale metrics infrastructure who need enterprise-grade observability with tenant isolation and global metric visibility.
