`255kb/stack-on-a-budget` is a curated list repository providing a categorized collection of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings with generous free tiers for developers. The repository acts as a resource for developers to discover and utilize free services for various needs, including app hosting, databases, API management, monitoring, and CI/CD. It's structured as a list with detailed descriptions (linked via Markdown) of each service's free tier limitations and features, facilitating informed decisions for budget-conscious development. This project functions as a resource and a list for developers, not a standalone application or library.
