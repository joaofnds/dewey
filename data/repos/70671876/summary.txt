Stack on a Budget is a curated repository serving as a comprehensive reference guide for developers seeking cost-effective cloud services and development tools. It catalogs hundreds of SaaS and PaaS offerings across critical development infrastructure categories including app hosting (Vercel, Netlify, AWS), database hosting (MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, CircleCI), monitoring and logging (Sentry, New Relic), and content delivery networks. The repository targets budget-conscious developers, startups, and side-project builders who need production-grade infrastructure without significant monthly costs. Each service listing includes detailed free tier limitations, usage quotas, and technical specifications, enabling developers to architect complete application stacks using only free tiers from providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Firebase, and specialized developer tools.
