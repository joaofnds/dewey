This Go-based web crawler automates parcel tracking by scraping data from Parcels App, targeting system administrators and developers who need programmatic access to package tracking information. Built using Go 1.19+ with Chrome browser automation capabilities, it extracts tracking data and outputs structured information suitable for command-line processing with tools like jq, terminal multiplexers (TMUX), and status bars (Polybar). The application solves the problem of manual parcel tracking by providing automated, scriptable access to shipping information outside of traditional web interfaces. It uses headless browser automation to navigate the Parcels App website, parse tracking details, and present data in formats consumable by terminal-based workflows and system monitoring tools, making it valuable for DevOps professionals and power users who integrate package tracking into their desktop environments or automated monitoring systems.
