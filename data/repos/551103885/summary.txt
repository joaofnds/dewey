The `parcelsapp-crawler` project is a standalone command-line application written in Go designed to track parcel information from the Parcels App website. It automates the retrieval of tracking data, enabling users to monitor shipments directly from their terminal. Functionality includes parsing tracking information and allowing integration with tools like JQ, TMUX, and Polybar for data formatting and visualization. It utilizes Go version 1.19 or later and requires a user-configured JSON file for setup, optionally specifying the Chrome browser path.
