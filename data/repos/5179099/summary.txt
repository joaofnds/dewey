go-redis is the official Redis client library for Go applications, providing a comprehensive interface for interacting with Redis servers across distributed systems and web development environments. Built for Go developers working with caching, session management, pub/sub messaging, and data persistence, it supports Redis 7.2-8.0 with full command coverage except QUIT and SYNC. The library implements advanced Redis features including cluster management, sentinel failover, connection pooling, pipelines, transactions, Lua scripting, and Redis Stack probabilistic data structures. It offers multiple authentication mechanisms including experimental streaming credentials for managed identity services, supports both RESP2 and RESP3 protocols, and integrates with OpenTelemetry for observability. Target users include backend developers, DevOps engineers, and system architects building scalable Go applications requiring high-performance in-memory data operations, real-time messaging, and distributed caching solutions.
