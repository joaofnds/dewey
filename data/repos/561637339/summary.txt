This repository implements a satirical, Git-based social media platform that mimics Twitter functionality using distributed version control workflows. Built for the developer community and Git enthusiasts, it leverages Git's native features to recreate social networking primitives: empty commits serve as posts, forks create user accounts, remotes enable following users, cherry-picks function as retweets, and commit history displays timelines. The Shell-based implementation includes Makefile automation for common operations like timeline refresh, user discovery, and batch following. Supporting features include GPG commit signing for verification, image attachments through commit content, and encrypted messaging via SSH keys. This proof-of-concept demonstrates how Git's decentralized architecture can theoretically replace centralized social media platforms, targeting developers familiar with Git workflows and command-line interfaces while serving as both a functional prototype and commentary on platform decentralization.
