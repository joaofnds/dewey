The `validators` gem provides a comprehensive collection of ActiveModel/ActiveRecord validators for Ruby on Rails applications, extending the framework's built-in validation capabilities with specialized domain-specific validators. It targets Rails developers who need robust data validation for common web application scenarios, including email format validation (with disposable email detection), URL format validation, IP address validation (IPv4/IPv6), Brazilian tax document validation (CPF/CNPJ), hostname validation, username/subdomain validation with reserved name checking, datetime validation with relative comparisons, and model ownership validation for multi-tenant applications. The gem integrates seamlessly with Rails' validation DSL, allowing developers to use either traditional `validates_*_format_of` methods or the modern `validates` syntax with custom validator symbols, addressing the common need for standardized, reliable validation logic in Rails web applications.
