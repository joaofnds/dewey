This repository contains the build system and orchestration tools for the Brave web browser, a privacy-focused Chromium-based browser targeting desktop and mobile platforms. It serves as the primary build environment that fetches and synchronizes code from multiple repositories including the Chromium source tree, brave-core components, and the adblock-rust engine. The system uses Node.js/npm for build orchestration, depot_tools for Chromium integration, and maintains platform-specific patches for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. It addresses the complex challenge of maintaining a custom browser fork while staying synchronized with upstream Chromium releases, implementing privacy features like ad-blocking and tracking protection. The repository primarily targets browser developers and contributors working on privacy-focused web browser development, providing the necessary toolchain to compile and maintain a full-featured web browser across multiple operating systems.
