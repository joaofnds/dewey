The `brave/brave-browser` repository is the build system and source code for the Brave web browser, designed for macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS. This project primarily fetches and integrates Chromium source code, along with Brave-specific components like `brave-core` (containing patches) and the `adblock-rust` engine, to construct the browser application. The codebase is primarily in JavaScript, utilizing build tools and configurations defined in `package.json`, with Rust utilized for ad-blocking functionality. This project represents a standalone cross-platform web browser application, targeting end-users and developers who contribute to the Brave ecosystem.
