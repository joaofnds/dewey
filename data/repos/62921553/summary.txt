Rook is a cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, automating the deployment, management, and lifecycle of Ceph storage clusters. Built with Go, it provides a platform and framework for integrating Ceph's file, block, and object storage capabilities directly within Kubernetes. Rook utilizes Kubernetes resources to provision, configure, scale, and monitor Ceph deployments, offering self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. As a graduated CNCF project, it targets system administrators and developers managing cloud-native infrastructure with a focus on persistent storage solutions.
