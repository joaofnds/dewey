Rook is a cloud-native storage orchestrator built in Go that automates Ceph distributed storage deployment and management within Kubernetes clusters. It operates as a Kubernetes operator, leveraging custom resources and controllers to provision, scale, upgrade, and monitor Ceph storage services that provide file, block, and object storage capabilities. The project targets DevOps engineers and platform administrators managing containerized infrastructure who need persistent storage solutions for stateful applications in Kubernetes environments. Rook solves the complexity of manually deploying and operating Ceph clusters by providing self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services through native Kubernetes integration. As a CNCF graduated project, it enables production-grade distributed storage for cloud-native applications while abstracting away the operational overhead of traditional storage cluster management.
