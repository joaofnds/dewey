Immer is a JavaScript library that enables immutable state management by allowing developers to write seemingly mutable code that produces immutable data structures. Built for web development and specifically targeting React/Redux ecosystems, it uses Proxy objects and copy-on-write mechanics to intercept mutations and generate new immutable state trees. The library solves the complexity of manually creating immutable updates in JavaScript applications, particularly for state management patterns where immutability is required for performance optimizations like React's reconciliation and Redux's state comparison. Frontend developers working with React, Redux, and other state management libraries use Immer to simplify reducer logic and state updates while maintaining immutability guarantees essential for predictable application behavior and efficient re-rendering.
