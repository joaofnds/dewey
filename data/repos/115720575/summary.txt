Immer.js is a JavaScript library designed to facilitate immutable state management by allowing developers to work with mutable data structures. It enables the creation of the next immutable state by directly mutating the current state, utilizing a proxy-based approach to track changes and produce an immutable result. This is a developer productivity tool targeting JavaScript developers, particularly those working with state management patterns like Redux and building state-driven applications. The library's core functionality revolves around simplifying the process of creating immutable data, addressing a fundamental problem in JavaScript application development.
