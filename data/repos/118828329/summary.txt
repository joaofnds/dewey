Knative Serving is a Kubernetes-native serverless platform written in Go that enables automatic scaling and deployment of containerized applications and functions. It provides middleware primitives for deploying serverless containers with scale-to-zero capabilities, automatic request-driven scaling, and traffic routing through Kubernetes custom resources and controllers. The platform targets DevOps engineers and platform teams building cloud-native infrastructure, solving the problem of efficiently running stateless workloads that need to scale dynamically based on demand while minimizing resource consumption during idle periods. Key features include point-in-time configuration snapshots, network programming abstractions, and integration with Kubernetes networking and autoscaling mechanisms, making it suitable for microservices architectures and function-as-a-service deployments on Kubernetes clusters.
