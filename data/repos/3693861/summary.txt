restclient.el is an HTTP REST API testing and exploration tool built as an Emacs major mode using Emacs Lisp. Targeting web developers and API engineers, it enables interactive HTTP request execution directly within Emacs buffers through plain-text query files. The tool supports all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), custom headers, request bodies, and variable substitution with Elisp evaluation. It provides intelligent response handling with pretty-printing for JSON/XML, image display, and integration with external tools like jq for response processing. Key features include query navigation, cURL command generation, Helm integration, and buffer management through keyboard shortcuts. It solves the problem of context-switching between development environments and standalone API testing tools by embedding REST client functionality directly into the Emacs ecosystem, particularly valuable for developers who prefer text-based workflows over GUI tools like Postman.
