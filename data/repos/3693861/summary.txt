`restclient.el` is an Emacs Lisp-based tool designed for manually exploring and testing HTTP REST web services directly within the Emacs editor. It provides a major mode (`restclient-mode`) that enables users to compose and execute HTTP requests from plain-text query files, displaying responses with syntax highlighting for XML, JSON, and even images. Key features include support for variable declaration, inline Elisp evaluation, file uploads, and integration with Helm for variables and request completion. This is a plugin/extension specifically for Emacs, targeting developers and testers who need a command-line-like tool for interacting with REST APIs.
