Emacs Taskrunner is an Emacs Lisp library that provides a unified interface for discovering and executing build tasks from various task runners and build systems within the Emacs editor. It supports 20+ build tools including npm/yarn, Gradle, Make, CMake, cargo, gulp, grunt, and others commonly used in web development, DevOps, and software engineering workflows. The library integrates with projectile for project detection, uses emacs-async for non-blocking task retrieval, and provides frontends through ivy and helm completion frameworks. It solves the problem of context-switching between different build tool interfaces by allowing developers to discover and run any project's build tasks directly from Emacs through a consistent interactive interface, with built-in caching to avoid repeated task parsing overhead.
