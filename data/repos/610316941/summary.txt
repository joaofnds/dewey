Chainloop is a Go-based evidence store and policy engine for software supply chain security in DevSecOps environments. It provides a centralized platform for collecting, storing, and validating software supply chain attestations including SBOMs (CycloneDX, SPDX), VEX documents, SARIF security reports, and SLSA provenance data. The system implements contract-based workflows that allow security and compliance teams to define requirements through declarative policies written in Rego, while developers integrate through CI/CD pipelines using a simplified CLI tool. Built on open standards including Sigstore, in-toto, and OCI specifications, it targets regulated industries requiring OSS compliance and supply chain transparency. The platform supports third-party integrations with tools like Dependency-Track and GUAC, enabling automated policy evaluation and artifact distribution across multiple storage backends for enterprise security and compliance teams.
