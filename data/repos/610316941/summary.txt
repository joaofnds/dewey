Chainloop is an open-source evidence store and policy engine, designed for software supply chain security and compliance within the DevSecOps domain. Built in Go, it enables users to manage and store attestations, SBOMs, VEX, and other software supply chain artifacts, leveraging standards like Sigstore, in-toto, SLSA, and OCI. Key functionalities include declarative workflow contracts for CI/CD integration, policy-as-code capabilities using Rego, and third-party integrations for SBOM analysis and artifact storage. This project provides a CLI for developers and a control plane for security and compliance teams, creating a role-tailored experience for managing and enforcing supply chain security requirements.
