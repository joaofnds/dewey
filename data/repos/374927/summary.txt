Erlang/OTP is the official implementation of the Erlang programming language and Open Telecom Platform, designed for building massively scalable, fault-tolerant distributed systems with soft real-time requirements. Targeting telecommunications, messaging systems, web servers, and high-availability applications, it provides a functional programming runtime with lightweight process concurrency, supervisor trees for fault recovery, and hot code swapping capabilities. The platform includes the BEAM virtual machine, standard libraries, and OTP behavior patterns (GenServer, Supervisor, Application) that enforce reliability design principles. Primarily used by systems engineers and backend developers building mission-critical infrastructure like WhatsApp, RabbitMQ, and telecom switches where 99.999% uptime and horizontal scaling across distributed nodes are essential requirements.
