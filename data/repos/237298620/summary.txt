org-superstar-mode is an Emacs Lisp package that enhances the visual presentation of Org mode documents by replacing ASCII bullets with UTF-8 symbols and applying custom styling to headings and list items. Built as a rewritten successor to org-bullets, it targets Emacs users and technical writers who use Org mode for documentation, note-taking, and project management. The package implements font-lock mechanisms to prettify heading stars, plain list bullets, inline tasks, and TODO keywords while gracefully degrading in terminal environments. It addresses the visual monotony of plain-text Org documents by providing configurable Unicode bullet replacements, custom faces for different heading levels, and context-sensitive formatting that preserves code block integrity. The package integrates with major Emacs distributions like Spacemacs and Doom Emacs, serving productivity-focused developers and researchers who rely on Org mode for structured text editing.
