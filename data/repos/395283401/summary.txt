Kubescape is a comprehensive Kubernetes security platform built in Go that provides security scanning, compliance checking, and vulnerability detection across the entire container orchestration lifecycle. It targets DevOps engineers, security teams, and Kubernetes administrators who need to secure containerized environments from development to runtime. The platform integrates Open Policy Agent (OPA) for policy enforcement, Grype for image vulnerability scanning, Copacetic for image patching, and Inspektor Gadget for eBPF-based runtime monitoring. Kubescape scans Kubernetes clusters, YAML manifests, and Helm charts against multiple security frameworks including NSA-CISA guidelines, MITRE ATT&CK, and CIS Benchmarks, delivering results in multiple formats (JSON, SARIF, HTML, PDF). It operates as both a CLI tool and in-cluster operator, supporting IDE integration, CI/CD pipelines, and continuous runtime security monitoring for cloud-native infrastructure.
