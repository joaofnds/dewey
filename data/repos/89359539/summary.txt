**should-up** is a JavaScript command-line utility designed for web development teams to programmatically refactor unit test descriptions by removing "should" prefixes from test cases. Built as an npm package, it performs automated code transformation across JavaScript test files, parsing test descriptions in popular testing frameworks (like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine) and converting passive voice test descriptions ("should store data") to active voice ("stores data"). The tool addresses code quality and readability concerns in test suites by eliminating verbose, uncertain language patterns that clutter test output. Targeted at JavaScript developers and QA engineers working on web applications, it operates as a codemod tool that batch-processes test files in specified directories, improving test documentation clarity and making test reports more concise and assertive.
