Spaceship Prompt is a highly customizable Zsh shell prompt framework designed for developers and system administrators working in modern software development environments. Built entirely in Shell script, it provides contextual information display for development workflows including Git/Mercurial repository status, runtime environments (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, PHP, Rust, Swift), containerization tools (Docker, Kubernetes), package managers (npm, cargo, composer), and system status indicators. The prompt integrates seamlessly with popular Zsh frameworks like Oh My Zsh and supports Powerline/Nerd Fonts for enhanced visual representation. It addresses the need for efficient command-line productivity by surfacing relevant project context, development tool versions, and system state directly in the terminal prompt, eliminating the need for frequent status checks and reducing cognitive overhead during development tasks across DevOps, web development, and general software engineering workflows.
