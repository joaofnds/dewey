Urchin is an open-source PCB design for a 34-key wireless mechanical keyboard targeting the custom keyboard enthusiast community. Built specifically for the ZMK firmware ecosystem, it integrates with nice!nano microcontrollers and nice!view displays, supporting only Kailh Choc v1 switches with hotswap sockets. The design uses KiCad for PCB layout and includes switch matrix with SMD diodes, distinguishing it from direct-pin designs like the Ferris/Sweep keyboards it's inspired by. The repository provides complete manufacturing files, 3D-printable cases, and mounting hardware specifications for hobbyists and keyboard builders seeking a wireless-first, low-profile mechanical keyboard solution with integrated OLED displays for status information.
