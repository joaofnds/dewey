Roc is a functional programming language implementation written in Rust, designed as a fast and developer-friendly alternative for general-purpose software development. The project builds a complete language toolchain including compiler, type system, and standard library, targeting developers who want functional programming benefits without sacrificing performance. Roc compiles to native code and emphasizes zero-cost abstractions, immutable data structures, and strong static typing. The language targets application developers, systems programmers, and functional programming enthusiasts seeking a modern alternative to languages like Haskell or Elm but with better performance characteristics. The implementation leverages Rust's memory safety and performance for the compiler infrastructure while providing a more accessible functional programming syntax and semantics for end users.
