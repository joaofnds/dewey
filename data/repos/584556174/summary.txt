`conc` is a Go library providing structured concurrency primitives to simplify and enhance the safety of concurrent Go programs. It offers features including a safer `WaitGroup`, a concurrency-limited task runner (`pool.Pool`), and concurrent task execution with results handling (`pool.ResultPool`), as well as utilities for streams, slice iteration, and panic handling. Built for Go developers, it aims to mitigate goroutine leaks, gracefully handle panics, and improve the readability of concurrent code, acting primarily as a developer productivity library.
