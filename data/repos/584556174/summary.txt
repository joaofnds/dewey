`sourcegraph/conc` is a Go library that provides structured concurrency primitives to simplify and secure goroutine management for Go developers. The library addresses common concurrency challenges in backend systems, CLI tools, and distributed applications by offering panic-safe alternatives to Go's standard `sync.WaitGroup`, worker pools with configurable concurrency limits, result collection mechanisms, and error handling patterns. Key components include `conc.WaitGroup`, `pool.Pool` variants for task execution, `stream.Stream` for ordered parallel processing, and `iter` utilities for concurrent slice operations. The library targets Go developers building concurrent applications who need better goroutine lifecycle management, structured error propagation, and protection against panic-induced crashes while maintaining performance in multi-threaded workloads.
