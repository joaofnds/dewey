Thor is a Ruby-based command-line interface (CLI) toolkit designed for building self-documenting command-line utilities and applications. Targeting Ruby developers and system administrators, it serves as an alternative to Rake for creating CLI tools with structured argument parsing, automatic help generation, and task execution capabilities. Built on Ruby's open-uri library, Thor simplifies the complexities of command-line option parsing and banner generation through a Rake-like DSL syntax. The toolkit addresses the common developer need for creating robust CLI applications without manually handling argument validation, usage documentation, or command routing, making it particularly valuable for DevOps automation, build tools, and Ruby-based system utilities where command-line interfaces are essential.
