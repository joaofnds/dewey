Swarmpit is a mobile-friendly web application UI designed for managing Docker Swarm clusters. It provides a user interface to manage stacks, services, secrets, volumes, and networks within a Docker Swarm environment, including integration with Docker Hub and custom registries for private repository deployments. Built with Clojure on the backend and React on the frontend, the application utilizes CouchDB for data persistence and InfluxDB for cluster statistics. This self-hosted management console aims to provide a secure and convenient interface for DevOps teams to interact with their Docker Swarm infrastructure.
