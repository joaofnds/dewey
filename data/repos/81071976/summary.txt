Swarmpit is a lightweight web-based management interface for Docker Swarm clusters, built in Clojure with a React frontend and designed for DevOps and container orchestration workflows. It provides system administrators and DevOps engineers with a mobile-friendly Progressive Web App (PWA) to manage Docker Swarm resources including services, stacks, secrets, volumes, networks, and container deployments. The platform integrates with Docker Hub and custom registries for seamless private repository deployment, while offering multi-user access control and team collaboration features. Built on a microservices architecture using CouchDB for application data persistence and InfluxDB for cluster statistics, Swarmpit addresses the need for simplified Docker Swarm management without relying on external SaaS platforms, targeting organizations running containerized applications in Docker Swarm mode who require centralized cluster administration and monitoring capabilities.
