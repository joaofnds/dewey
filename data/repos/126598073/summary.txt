`emacs-format-all-the-code` is an Emacs Lisp package that provides unified code formatting functionality across 50+ programming languages and markup formats through a single command interface. It abstracts language-specific formatters (prettier, clang-format, gofmt, rustfmt, black, etc.) behind a consistent `format-all-region-or-buffer` command and `format-all-mode` minor mode for automatic formatting on save. The package targets software developers working in polyglot environments who need consistent code formatting without learning separate Emacs packages for each language. It supports languages spanning web development (JavaScript, CSS, HTML), systems programming (C/C++, Rust, Go), data science (Python, R, SQL), DevOps (YAML, Dockerfile, Terraform), and many others, solving the complexity of managing multiple language-specific formatting tools within the Emacs editor ecosystem.
