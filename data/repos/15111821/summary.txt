Grafana is an open-source observability and data visualization platform built with TypeScript and Go that enables monitoring, alerting, and business intelligence across distributed systems. Targeting DevOps engineers, SREs, and data analysts, it provides a unified interface for querying and visualizing metrics, logs, and traces from multiple data sources including Prometheus, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. The platform features customizable dashboards with dynamic templating, real-time alerting with integrations to notification systems like Slack and PagerDuty, and cross-datasource querying capabilities. Grafana solves the observability problem in modern infrastructure by centralizing monitoring data from disparate sources into coherent visualizations, enabling teams to troubleshoot issues, track performance metrics, and maintain system reliability through comprehensive dashboards and proactive alerting mechanisms.
