This repository provides a macOS-optimized distribution of TensorFlow that leverages Apple's ML Compute framework for hardware acceleration on M1 and Intel-based Macs running macOS 11.0+. Targeting machine learning engineers and data scientists, it addresses performance bottlenecks in deep learning workloads by enabling GPU acceleration through Apple's Metal Performance Shaders and CPU optimization via Accelerate framework. The solution includes pre-built Python packages for TensorFlow r2.4rc0 and TensorFlow Addons 0.11.2, distributed via shell-based installation scripts that create isolated virtual environments. It serves as a bridge between TensorFlow's computational graph execution and Apple's native ML acceleration APIs, offering device selection controls and debugging capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing TensorFlow codebases for improved training and inference performance on Apple silicon.
