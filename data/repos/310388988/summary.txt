This repository provides a macOS-optimized distribution of TensorFlow and TensorFlow Addons, enabling hardware-accelerated machine learning on Apple silicon (M1) and Intel-based Macs using the ML Compute framework. It facilitates accelerated model training and inference by leveraging Metal for GPU acceleration, offering installation via a shell script or archive download. Key features include optional device selection for CPU or GPU utilization and logging capabilities for debugging graph and eager modes. It is a pre-release plugin/library for TensorFlow, primarily targeting data scientists and machine learning engineers using macOS for model development.
