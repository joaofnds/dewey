**tuple-it** is a JavaScript/TypeScript utility library for web development that transforms Promise-based async/await error handling by wrapping promise results into `[error, data]` tuples. It eliminates the need for nested try/catch blocks in asynchronous operations by providing both a standalone function (`t`) and a Promise prototype extension (`.tuple()` method). The library handles promise rejections with non-Error objects by wrapping them in a `TupleItError` class, supports promisable objects that may return either values or promises, and includes full TypeScript type support with custom error and data type generics. Targeted at JavaScript/Node.js developers working with async/await patterns, it addresses the common problem of cumbersome promise rejection handling in modern web applications and APIs.
