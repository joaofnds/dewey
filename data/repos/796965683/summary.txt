`tuple-it` is a JavaScript library designed to simplify error handling within asynchronous JavaScript code, specifically for use with `async`/`await` operations. It provides a `tuple()` method (and an alias `t` function) that wraps promises, returning a `[error, data]` tuple to streamline the process of checking for promise rejections without requiring nested `try`/`catch` blocks. The library offers TypeScript support, addresses handling of both promise-returning and value-returning functions, and includes a `TupleItError` class to wrap non-Error rejections. This developer productivity tool is a JavaScript library aimed at JavaScript/TypeScript developers who work with asynchronous operations.
