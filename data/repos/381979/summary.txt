FullCalendar is a comprehensive JavaScript calendar component library built in TypeScript that provides full-featured event scheduling and calendar management functionality for web applications. Targeting frontend web developers, it offers drag-and-drop event manipulation, multiple view modes (day, week, month grids), and interactive calendar interfaces through a modular plugin architecture. The library integrates with major frontend frameworks including React, Angular, and Vue through dedicated connectors, while supporting both npm package installation and CDN deployment via standard bundles. It addresses the common web development need for sophisticated calendar UIs in business applications, project management tools, and scheduling systems by providing customizable event rendering, timezone handling, and user interaction capabilities without requiring developers to build calendar logic from scratch.
