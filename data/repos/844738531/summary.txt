InstantDB is a modern real-time database library for Clojure frontends, providing efficient data fetching, permission checking, and offline caching. It supports relational queries in the shape of desired data, with optimistic updates and rollbacks handled automatically. Ephemeral updates, such as cursors or presence tracking, are also supported. InstantDB offers SDKs for JavaScript, React, and React Native, enabling developers to create real-time applications quickly and easily. By compressing common web development schleps into a database solution, InstantDB allows engineers to focus on building great user experiences without worrying about stores, selectors, endpoints, or local caches.
