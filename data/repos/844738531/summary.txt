Instant is a real-time database platform for web and mobile development that provides Firebase-like functionality with a client-side database architecture. Built with Clojure on the backend and supporting JavaScript, React, and React Native SDKs, it enables frontend developers to write relational queries using InstaQL (a GraphQL-like syntax) while automatically handling data fetching, permission checking, offline caching, and optimistic updates. The system uses a triple-store architecture backed by PostgreSQL, implements a sync server that monitors WAL for real-time updates, and provides multiplayer functionality by default. Targeting frontend developers building modern web applications, Instant eliminates the need for traditional backend infrastructure, ORMs, endpoints, and client-side state management by moving database operations directly to the client with automatic synchronization and conflict resolution.
