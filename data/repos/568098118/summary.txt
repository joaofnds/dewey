Plane is an open-source, web-based project management application designed as an alternative to tools like Jira and Asana. Built with TypeScript for the frontend (Next.js) and Python (Django) for the backend, it provides issue tracking, Kanban boards, cycle/sprint management, module organization, and product roadmap features.  The application leverages PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker for persistence and deployment, with a REST API for programmatic access. This project is a full-stack, self-hostable web application targeting project managers, software teams, and product managers seeking a comprehensive work management platform.
