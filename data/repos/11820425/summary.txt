`parallax` is a JavaScript library designed to create a parallax effect, reacting to smart device orientation or cursor position to simulate depth on web pages. It provides declarative and programmatic configuration options for customizing the effect, including features like relative input, hover-only behavior, input element selection, axis inversion, movement limits, and friction control. This library is intended for frontend developers to enhance website interactivity by adding dynamic visual effects, leveraging the device's gyroscope or cursor input to move layers with varying depths defined by data attributes. It is distributed as a JavaScript library and can be installed via CDN or npm.
