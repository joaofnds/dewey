Parallax.js is a JavaScript library designed for web developers to create parallax motion effects that respond to device orientation sensors or mouse cursor position. The library targets front-end web development, specifically interactive web interfaces and visual experiences. It leverages device gyroscope and accelerometer APIs on mobile devices, falling back to cursor tracking on desktop browsers. The engine calculates depth-based layer movements using CSS transforms, allowing developers to create immersive visual effects where background elements move at different speeds relative to foreground content. The library provides both programmatic and declarative configuration options, supports real-time parameter adjustment, and integrates with modern JavaScript build tools including npm, browserify, and babel for production deployment.
