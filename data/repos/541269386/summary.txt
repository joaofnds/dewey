`whisper.cpp` is a C/C++ implementation of OpenAI's Whisper, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, designed for high-performance inference on various platforms. The project provides a lightweight, dependency-free core library along with numerous optimizations, including support for Apple Silicon (Metal, Core ML), x86 (AVX), POWER (VSX), and GPU acceleration via CUDA, Vulkan, and OpenVINO. Functionality includes mixed precision, integer quantization, and voice activity detection, enabling users to transcribe audio with a CLI tool, integrate it into diverse applications, and leverage bindings in several programming languages. This project is a C++ library and CLI tool for developers seeking to integrate offline, speech-to-text capabilities across multiple operating systems and hardware architectures.
