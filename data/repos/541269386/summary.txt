whisper.cpp is a high-performance C/C++ port of OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model designed for efficient offline speech-to-text inference across multiple platforms. Built on the ggml machine learning library, it implements transformer-based speech recognition with hardware-specific optimizations including ARM NEON, AVX intrinsics, Metal GPU acceleration, CUDA support, and integer quantization for reduced memory usage. The library targets audio processing and speech recognition applications in mobile development, embedded systems, and desktop software where developers need lightweight, dependency-free ASR capabilities. It provides cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, WebAssembly, Linux, Windows) with zero runtime memory allocations and supports various precision modes (F16/F32) for optimal performance on resource-constrained devices.
