Day.js is a lightweight 2kB JavaScript date-time manipulation library designed as a drop-in replacement for Moment.js in web development environments. Built for frontend and Node.js applications, it provides an immutable, chainable API for parsing, validating, manipulating, formatting, and displaying dates and times. The library features modular architecture with plugin-based extensibility, comprehensive internationalization support, and maintains API compatibility with Moment.js while significantly reducing bundle size. Targeted at JavaScript developers working on web applications, mobile apps, and Node.js services, Day.js addresses the performance overhead of larger date libraries while preserving familiar developer experience. It supports all modern browsers and offers tree-shaking capabilities for optimal production builds.
