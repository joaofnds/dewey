Grype is a standalone, Go-based vulnerability scanner designed for container images and filesystems. It analyzes container images (Docker, OCI, and Singularity formats) and file system directories to identify known vulnerabilities, including those affecting OS packages (Alpine, Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) and language-specific dependencies (Ruby, Java, JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.). Key features include support for OpenVEX, SBOM integration, and various output formats (table, JSON, CycloneDX, SARIF, and custom templates) for reporting. This CLI tool is intended for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and security professionals concerned with container image security and vulnerability management.
