Grype is a command-line vulnerability scanner written in Go that targets the DevOps and container security domain. It scans container images, filesystems, and Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to identify known security vulnerabilities in both operating system packages (Alpine, Ubuntu, RHEL, etc.) and language-specific dependencies (NPM, Maven, PyPI, Cargo, etc.). The tool integrates with container runtimes (Docker, Podman), supports multiple image formats (OCI, Singularity), and works alongside Syft for SBOM generation. It outputs vulnerability reports in various formats including JSON, SARIF, and CycloneDX, with OpenVEX support for vulnerability filtering. Primary users are DevOps engineers, security teams, and developers implementing container security scanning in CI/CD pipelines and production environments.
