Based on the repository name "little-big-city" and the JavaScript language designation, this appears to be a web-based city visualization or simulation project built with JavaScript. The project likely implements procedural city generation, 3D rendering, or urban planning visualization using web technologies such as WebGL, Three.js, or Canvas API. Targeting web developers and interactive visualization enthusiasts, it addresses the need for browser-based urban modeling, architectural visualization, or game development prototyping. The codebase probably handles geometric city generation algorithms, 3D scene management, and real-time rendering optimization. Primary use cases include educational simulations, urban planning demonstrations, or interactive web experiences showcasing procedural generation techniques for creating scalable city environments within web browsers.
