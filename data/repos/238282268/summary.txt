nvim-tree.lua is a file explorer plugin for the Neovim text editor, written entirely in Lua and targeting software developers who use Neovim as their primary development environment. It provides a hierarchical tree-based file browser interface with features including Git integration, LSP diagnostics display, file type icons, live filtering, and standard file operations (create, delete, rename, copy, paste). The plugin replaces Neovim's built-in netrw file manager and integrates with nvim-web-devicons for enhanced visual representation. It addresses the need for efficient file navigation and project structure visualization within the Neovim ecosystem, offering extensive customization through Lua configuration and a comprehensive API for developers to extend functionality. The tool serves the broader software development domain across all programming languages and project types.
