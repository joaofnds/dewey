The `typescript-language-server` is a TypeScript and JavaScript Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation, providing language features for TypeScript projects. It wraps `tsserver` to offer functionalities such as code actions on save (e.g., organize imports, remove unused variables), workspace commands (e.g., go to definition, apply refactoring), code lenses, and inlay hints. Built using TypeScript and targeting integration with code editors supporting LSP, this project functions as a developer productivity tool, enhancing the development experience with features commonly found in integrated development environments. It is a standalone CLI application that also provides configuration options.
