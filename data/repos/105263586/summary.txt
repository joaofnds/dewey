This TypeScript Language Server implements the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for TypeScript and JavaScript development environments, serving as a bridge between editors/IDEs and TypeScript's compiler services (tsserver). Built in TypeScript, it provides intelligent code features like autocompletion, error detection, refactoring, import organization, and go-to-definition across the web development ecosystem. The server wraps TypeScript's native tsserver and adapts VSCode's TypeScript Language Features extension logic to work with any LSP-compatible editor including Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, and others. It targets frontend and full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript developers who need rich language support outside of VSCode, enabling consistent TypeScript development experience across different editors while leveraging the same underlying compiler infrastructure that powers Microsoft's official TypeScript tooling.
