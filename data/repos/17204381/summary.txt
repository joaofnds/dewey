Ahoy is a first-party web analytics Ruby gem designed for Rails applications that enables developers to track user visits and custom events without relying on third-party analytics services. It provides comprehensive visitor tracking including traffic sources, geolocation, device information, and UTM parameters, storing data directly in the application's database (typically PostgreSQL/MySQL). The gem supports multi-platform event tracking through Ruby controllers, JavaScript frontend integration, and REST API endpoints for native mobile apps. Key features include automatic visit-to-user association, ActiveRecord model integration for linking business events (orders, signups) to visitor sessions, GDPR compliance tools, and bot filtering. Target users are Rails developers building web applications who need privacy-compliant analytics with full data ownership and the ability to perform complex queries using standard SQL and ActiveRecord methods.
