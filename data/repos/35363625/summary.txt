Ulauncher is a desktop productivity tool designed for Linux users seeking fast application launching and system navigation capabilities. Built with Python and GTK+, it provides a keyboard-driven interface for application search using fuzzy matching algorithms, file system browsing, basic calculations, and extensible functionality through a plugin architecture. The launcher integrates with Linux desktop environments and supports systemd service management for startup automation. Currently undergoing a major v6 rewrite, it targets Linux power users, system administrators, and desktop enthusiasts who prioritize efficient workflow automation and quick access to applications and files without relying on traditional desktop menus or file managers.
