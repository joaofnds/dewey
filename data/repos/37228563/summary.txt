Visual Boy Advance - M (VBA-M) is a C++ Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulator that continues development of the original VBA emulator for retro gaming enthusiasts and developers. The project targets desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) and provides cross-platform emulation through CMake build system, supporting multiple development environments including Visual Studio, MSys2, and various Linux distributions. It integrates with modern gaming infrastructure by offering Libretro core compatibility for RetroArch frontend integration, utilizes DirectX and OpenGL for graphics rendering, and supports both GUI and command-line interfaces. The emulator addresses accurate hardware emulation for preserving classic Nintendo handheld games, featuring automated dependency management through vcpkg, extensive cross-compilation support for 32-bit and ARM architectures, and distribution through package managers, Flatpak, and Snap for accessibility across gaming communities.
