pgweb is a cross-platform web-based PostgreSQL database administration tool written in Go, designed for database administrators, developers, and DevOps professionals who need lightweight database management capabilities. The application functions as a standalone HTTP server that provides a browser-based interface for PostgreSQL database exploration, eliminating the need for desktop database clients or complex IDE setups. Built with Go's standard library and PostgreSQL drivers, it offers core database operations including SQL query execution, table browsing, data export to CSV/JSON/XML formats, and connection management with SSH tunnel support. The tool addresses the need for platform-independent database access in development, testing, and production environments, particularly valuable for containerized deployments and remote database management scenarios where traditional desktop clients are impractical.
