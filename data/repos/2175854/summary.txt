Acts As Tenant is a Ruby gem that implements row-level multi-tenancy for Rails web applications using a shared database architecture. It enables Rails developers to scope ActiveRecord models to specific tenants (e.g., organizations or accounts) by adding tenant ID columns to database tables and automatically filtering queries based on the current tenant context. The gem provides multiple tenant identification strategies including subdomain-based lookup, domain-based lookup, and manual controller-based assignment, while offering built-in protections against tenant data leakage and cross-tenant access vulnerabilities. It integrates seamlessly with Rails' ORM layer, includes tenant-scoped validation helpers, and maintains transparent query scoping across all database operations, making it ideal for SaaS applications requiring secure data isolation between customers in shared database environments.
