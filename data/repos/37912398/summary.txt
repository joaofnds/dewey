NGINX is the official open-source repository for the widely-used NGINX web server, load balancer, reverse proxy, API gateway, and content cache. Written in C, it provides core functionalities including HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support, TLS encryption, TCP/UDP proxying, and mail proxy capabilities, catering to high-performance web infrastructure needs. The project is a standalone application offering a highly configurable architecture based on modules, allowing for extensive customization of web server behavior and facilitating deployments on various platforms, with binary packages available for most major operating systems. It also features dynamic module loading via a custom njs implementation which extends core functionality using Javascript syntax.
