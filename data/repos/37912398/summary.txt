NGINX is a high-performance C-based web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer designed for web infrastructure and DevOps environments. It serves as a critical component in modern web architectures, handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 with QUIC protocol support, and providing content caching, SSL/TLS termination, and API gateway functionality. The modular architecture supports both static and dynamic modules, enabling TCP/UDP proxying, mail proxy services, and rate limiting capabilities. Primary users include system administrators, DevOps engineers, and web developers who need scalable solutions for serving web content, distributing traffic across backend servers, and managing high-concurrent connections in production environments. NGINX addresses performance bottlenecks in web service delivery through its event-driven, asynchronous architecture optimized for handling thousands of simultaneous connections efficiently.
