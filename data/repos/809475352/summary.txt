This repository provides a Docker-containerized solution for running macOS virtual machines on Linux hosts, targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who need macOS environments for testing, development, or CI/CD pipelines. Built using Shell scripts, it leverages QEMU/KVM virtualization with hardware acceleration, includes a web-based VNC viewer accessible via port 8006, and supports automatic macOS installer downloads for versions 11-15 (Big Sur through Sequoia). The container handles complex virtualization setup including network bridging, storage management, and macOS-specific boot procedures, solving the problem of accessing macOS environments on non-Apple hardware for cross-platform development, automated testing, and build processes without requiring physical Mac hardware.
