persp-mode.el is an Emacs Lisp extension that implements named perspectives (workspace management) for Emacs text editor users, particularly software developers and power users who work with multiple projects simultaneously. It provides buffer and window configuration isolation by creating separate workspaces that can group related files, maintain distinct window layouts, and persist state across Emacs sessions. Built on perspective-el but enhanced with frame-sharing capabilities and file-based serialization, it solves the problem of context switching between different coding projects or tasks within a single Emacs instance. The tool offers comprehensive buffer management, perspective switching via configurable keybindings, and extensible save/restore mechanisms for various buffer types including shell modes, compilation buffers, and version control interfaces, targeting developers in software engineering, DevOps, and system administration domains.
