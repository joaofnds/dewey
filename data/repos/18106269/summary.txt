LZ4 is a high-performance, lossless compression algorithm library written in C. It provides extremely fast compression and decompression speeds, exceeding 500 MB/s per core for compression and multiple GB/s per core for decompression, making it suitable for applications where speed is critical. The library includes both a default, fast compression mode and an LZ4_HC mode for higher compression ratios, offering tunable speed-compression trade-offs. This project is a C library with a command-line interface, designed for data compression and decompression tasks, and is compatible with dictionary compression, improving performance on small files.
