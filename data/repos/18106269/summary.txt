LZ4 is a high-performance lossless compression library implemented in C, designed for applications requiring extremely fast compression and decompression speeds exceeding 500 MB/s and multiple GB/s respectively. The library targets system developers, embedded engineers, and performance-critical applications across domains including file systems, databases, network protocols, and real-time data processing. It implements the LZ4 compression algorithm with configurable speed-vs-ratio trade-offs through acceleration factors and LZ4_HC variant, supporting both block-level and streaming compression with frame format compatibility. The library features dictionary compression capabilities, multi-core scalability, and provides both C API and command-line interfaces, making it suitable for system-level integration where compression speed is prioritized over maximum compression ratio.
