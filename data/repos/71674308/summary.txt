This repository provides Mustache templates for generating i3 window manager configuration files with Base16 color schemes, targeting Linux desktop users and system administrators who use tiling window managers. It generates themed configuration files that can be directly appended to i3 configs or used as modular color variable definitions. The repository offers three integration approaches: complete config files with bar configurations, standalone color variables for custom implementations, and separate bar-colors/client-properties modules. Built on the Base16 theming specification and part of the tinted-theming ecosystem, it solves the problem of consistent color theming across i3 desktop environments, enabling users to dynamically switch themes via curl commands or automated configuration management, particularly useful for dotfiles management and desktop customization workflows.
