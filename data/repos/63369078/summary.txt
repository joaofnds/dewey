`picom` is a lightweight compositor for the X Window System (X11), designed to enhance the visual appearance and animations of graphical user interfaces on Linux systems. Functionality includes window compositing with animation support, derived from the `compton` project. Built in C, it relies on libraries such as `libx11`, `xcb`, `pixman`, and others for X11 interaction, and utilizes `meson` for building. `picom` is a standalone application aimed at users seeking improved desktop compositing effects on X11-based desktop environments.
