**picom** is a lightweight compositor for X11 window systems, serving as a modern fork of the Compton compositor. Built in C using XCB (X protocol C-language binding) and leveraging OpenGL/EGL for hardware acceleration, it provides window compositing effects including transparency, shadows, fading animations, and visual enhancements for Linux desktop environments. The compositor integrates with X.org display servers through XCB libraries (xcb-composite, xcb-render, xcb-damage) and uses pixman for software rendering fallbacks. Targeted at Linux system administrators, desktop environment developers, and power users seeking customizable window management effects, picom addresses the need for efficient desktop compositing without the overhead of full desktop environments, particularly in tiling window managers and minimal desktop setups.
