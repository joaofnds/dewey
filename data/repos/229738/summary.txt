Jdbi is a Java library providing an idiomatic and convenient API for accessing relational databases within JVM technologies like Kotlin, Clojure, and Scala. Built upon JDBC, it simplifies database interactions by offering features that facilitate SQL execution and data mapping.  This library supports a wide range of databases through JDBC drivers and includes compatibility testing with various popular Java libraries. Jdbi is a library primarily for Java developers seeking to improve database interactions in their applications, especially those migrating from other database access technologies such as Spring JDBC or plain JDBC.
