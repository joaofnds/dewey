Jdbi is a Java database access library that provides an idiomatic, higher-level abstraction over JDBC for JVM-based applications. Built specifically for the enterprise Java development domain, it simplifies relational database interactions for Java, Kotlin, Clojure, and Scala developers by eliminating boilerplate JDBC code while maintaining type safety and performance. The library supports comprehensive SQL mapping capabilities, object-relational mapping, and integrates with popular Java ecosystem frameworks including Spring, Guice, Jackson, and Guava. Targeting backend developers and data access layer architects, Jdbi solves the complexity of raw JDBC programming by offering fluent APIs, annotation-driven configuration, and seamless integration with modern Java build tooling, while maintaining compatibility across multiple database vendors and supporting contemporary JVM language features.
