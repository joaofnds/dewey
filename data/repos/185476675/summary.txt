`htmlq` is a command-line tool written in Rust that functions as a selector-based HTML content extractor, analogous to `jq` for JSON. It parses HTML documents and allows users to query and extract specific elements or attributes based on CSS selectors. Key functionalities include selecting elements by ID, class, or tag, extracting attribute values, removing nodes before output, and offering pretty-printing of the extracted HTML. This standalone application is targeted towards developers and system administrators who need to programmatically extract data from HTML sources, such as scraping web pages or processing HTML files in automated workflows.
