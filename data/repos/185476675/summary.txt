**htmlq** is a command-line HTML parsing and extraction tool written in Rust that functions as an HTML equivalent to the popular `jq` JSON processor. It leverages CSS selectors to extract, filter, and manipulate content from HTML documents, targeting web developers, DevOps engineers, and data extraction specialists who need to programmatically process HTML in shell scripts and automation pipelines. The tool supports standard CSS selector syntax for element targeting, attribute extraction, text content retrieval, node removal, and HTML pretty-printing. Primary use cases include web scraping workflows, CI/CD pipeline HTML processing, content extraction from curl responses, and HTML document analysis tasks where developers need to parse structured web content without writing custom parsing scripts.
