FishUI is a Qt Quick Controls 2-based GUI library specifically designed for CutefishOS desktop applications. Built with C++ and targeting Linux desktop environments, it provides essential window management and theming components including borderless windows with XCB-based move/resize functionality, blur effects, drop shadows, light/dark mode theming, and desktop-level menu integration. The library addresses the need for consistent visual styling and advanced window compositing features across CutefishOS applications, requiring dependencies like Qt5 X11 extras, KDE Frameworks WindowSystem, and XCB libraries. It serves Qt/QML desktop application developers building native Linux applications who need modern UI components with advanced window management capabilities beyond standard Qt Quick Controls.
