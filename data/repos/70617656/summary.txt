The go-langserver is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation written in Go that provides code intelligence features for Go programming language support in editors and development tools. Operating in the developer tooling and IDE integration domain, it implements LSP to deliver core programming assistance features including go-to-definition, hover information, find-references, workspace symbols, and code completion using gocode integration. The server supports various Go development tools like goimports, gofmt, and golint for formatting and linting, while offering configurable initialization options for snippet completion, diagnostics, parallelism control, and GOPATH handling for monorepos. Designed for Go developers and editor maintainers, it solves the problem of providing standardized Go language support across different editors and IDEs through the universal LSP interface, though the project has been deprioritized in favor of Google's official gopls language server.
