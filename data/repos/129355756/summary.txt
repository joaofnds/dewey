`clj-new` is a Clojure-based command-line tool designed to generate new Clojure projects from various templates. It supports creating applications, libraries, and custom templates, leveraging Leiningen and Boot template formats, along with its own `clj` template format. Core functionality includes project scaffolding with options for different project types and configurations, including automatic generation of `deps.edn` and `pom.xml` files, simplifying project setup and dependency management. Built using Clojure and compatible with the Clojure CLI, it provides generators for adding or modifying code within existing projects. This developer productivity tool serves as a project generator for Clojure developers.
