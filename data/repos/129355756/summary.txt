clj-new is a Clojure project generation tool that creates new projects from Leiningen, Boot, or clj-template templates using only the Clojure CLI. It targets Clojure developers working in the JVM ecosystem who need to bootstrap applications, libraries, or custom templates without requiring additional build tools like Leiningen or Boot. The tool integrates with the modern Clojure toolchain (tools.deps, tools.build) and can be installed as a CLI tool or deps.edn alias. It addresses the problem of project scaffolding in the Clojure development workflow by providing a unified interface to generate structured projects with proper directory layouts, build configurations, and boilerplate code. The tool supports both built-in templates (app, lib, template) and public community templates, making it essential for Clojure developers who want to quickly initialize new projects while leveraging the official Clojure CLI tools rather than legacy build systems.
