The `ocaml/ocaml` repository constitutes the core system for the OCaml programming language, encompassing its compilers, runtime system, and foundational libraries. It provides the essential infrastructure for developing and executing OCaml programs, targeting the functional programming domain. Functionality centers on language compilation, runtime environment management, and access to base libraries crucial for program development and execution. This is a core system implementation project, serving as the foundation for all OCaml development efforts.
