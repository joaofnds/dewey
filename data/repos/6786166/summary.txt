The OCaml core repository contains the complete implementation of the OCaml functional programming language, including bytecode and native-code compilers, runtime system, garbage collector, and standard libraries. Targeting functional programming developers, compiler researchers, and systems programmers, it provides a statically-typed ML-family language with advanced module systems and object-oriented features. The codebase implements two compilation targets: a portable bytecode interpreter and an optimizing native compiler supporting x86-64, ARM64, RISC-V, PowerPC, and IBM Z architectures across Unix-like systems. OCaml 5.x introduces parallel programming through domains and effect handlers with a rewritten runtime, while maintaining the 4.x series for legacy compatibility. The system serves academic research, industrial functional programming applications, and serves as infrastructure for OCaml-based tools and libraries.
