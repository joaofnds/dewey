gSwitch is a macOS menu bar application designed to control the graphics processing unit (GPU) on dual-GPU MacBooks. Its core functionality allows users to switch between integrated, discrete, and dynamic GPU modes to extend battery life and potentially mitigate driver-related issues. Written in Swift, the application offers features such as GPU change notifications and command-line control options via the `--integrated`, `--discrete`, and `--dynamic` flags. It is distributed as a standalone application and uses Carthage for dependency management.
