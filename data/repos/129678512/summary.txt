gSwitch is a macOS menu bar application built in Swift that provides manual GPU switching control for dual-GPU MacBook Pro models. The application operates in the macOS system utilities domain, allowing users to force their laptops to use integrated graphics instead of discrete GPUs to preserve battery life and avoid driver issues. It offers three operational modes: integrated-only, discrete-only, and dynamic switching, with both GUI menu controls and command-line interface support. The tool leverages undocumented Apple APIs to override macOS's automatic GPU switching behavior, targeting power users, developers, and system administrators who need granular control over graphics hardware utilization. Built using Carthage for dependency management and distributed through Homebrew, it addresses hardware resource management challenges specific to dual-GPU Apple hardware running macOS 10.12 or later.
