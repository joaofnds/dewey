NES.css is a CSS framework written in SCSS that provides 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System-styled UI components for web applications. Targeting front-end developers and web designers, it offers pixel-perfect retro gaming aesthetics through pure CSS without JavaScript dependencies. The framework includes styled buttons, containers, dialogs, and other UI elements that mimic classic NES game interfaces, distributed via npm, Yarn, or CDN. It supports multiple languages with recommended pixel fonts like Press Start 2P and integrates with modern web development workflows through Sass imports or direct CSS inclusion. The framework addresses the niche use case of creating nostalgic, retro-themed web interfaces for gaming websites, portfolio sites, or applications requiring vintage 8-bit visual design language.
