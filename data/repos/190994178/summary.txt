cockroachdb/errors is a Go error handling library designed for distributed systems and database infrastructure, serving as a drop-in replacement for Go's standard errors package and github.com/pkg/errors. It provides critical network portability through protobuf serialization, enabling error objects to be transmitted across distributed nodes while maintaining compatibility between mixed-version deployments. The library includes comprehensive PII-free error reporting, automatic Sentry.io integration, stack trace capture, and specialized error wrappers for assertion failures, user hints, and issue tracking. Targeting backend Go developers and distributed systems engineers working on database systems, microservices, and networked applications, it addresses the challenge of maintaining error context and debugging capabilities across network boundaries in production distributed environments.
