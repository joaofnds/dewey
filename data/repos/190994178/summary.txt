The `cockroachdb/errors` repository provides a Go error library designed as a drop-in replacement for `github.com/pkg/errors` and Go's standard `errors` package, offering network portability for distributed systems and mixed-version compatibility. It focuses on features absent in the standard Go error handling, including transparent protobuf encoding/decoding, cross-network error recognition, and comprehensive support for PII-free reporting and Sentry.io integration. This library, written in Go, offers error constructors, wrappers, and utilities for managing error causes, safe details, stack traces, user hints, and telemetry keys, facilitating robust error handling in distributed database systems and other Go applications. The project is a library.
