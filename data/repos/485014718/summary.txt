This repository provides an asdf plugin for managing Dagger installations and versions. Dagger is a CI/CD and DevOps automation tool that uses containerized pipelines, and this plugin integrates it with asdf, a CLI version manager that allows developers to manage multiple runtime versions of various tools. Written in Shell scripts, the plugin enables DevOps engineers and developers to programmatically install, switch between, and manage different versions of Dagger across development environments. It addresses the common problem of tool version management in CI/CD workflows, allowing teams to maintain consistent Dagger versions across different projects and environments. The plugin follows asdf's standard plugin architecture, providing seamless integration with existing asdf-managed toolchains for infrastructure automation and continuous integration workflows.
