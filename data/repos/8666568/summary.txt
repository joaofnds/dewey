Peek is a Rails application profiling and performance monitoring tool that provides real-time visibility into web application metrics through an embedded debug bar. Built specifically for Ruby on Rails web development, it displays performance data including database queries, cache hits, Redis operations, and background job statistics directly in the browser interface. The gem uses an extensible plugin architecture allowing developers to integrate custom views for monitoring specific components like Elasticsearch, MySQL, or Memcached. It supports multiple storage adapters (Redis, Memcache, Elasticsearch) for multi-server production environments and tracks request performance data using Rails' unique request IDs. Originally developed at GitHub, Peek targets Rails developers and DevOps engineers who need granular application performance insights during development and production monitoring without external APM tools.
