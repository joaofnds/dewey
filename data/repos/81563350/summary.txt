`tmux-xpanes` is a shell script CLI tool designed to divide a terminal window into multiple panes based on `tmux`. Its core function is to execute commands across these panes, enabling parallel execution and monitoring of processes. Key features include flexible layout customization, logging capabilities, and the ability to run commands from both inside and outside of a `tmux` session. The project leverages `bash` scripting and depends on `tmux` for terminal management; it also integrates with Zsh completion. This is a standalone CLI application and plugin, useful for system administrators and developers managing multiple terminal processes.
