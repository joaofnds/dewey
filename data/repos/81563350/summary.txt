tmux-xpanes is a shell-based terminal multiplexer utility that automates the creation and management of multiple tmux panes for parallel command execution across distributed systems. Built primarily with Bash scripting, it targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, and infrastructure teams who need to execute commands simultaneously across multiple servers, containers, or cloud instances. The tool integrates with SSH, AWS Session Manager, Docker, and other remote access protocols to enable parallel operations like server monitoring, log collection, multi-host pinging, and distributed system management. It provides flexible pane layouts, command templating with parameter substitution, operation logging, and pipe-mode input processing, solving the common problem of manually managing multiple terminal sessions when working with distributed infrastructure at scale.
