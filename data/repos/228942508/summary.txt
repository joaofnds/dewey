Wish is a Go library for building custom SSH applications by providing an SSH server framework with middleware-based architecture. Built on top of gliderlabs/ssh, it enables developers to create secure remotely-accessible applications that leverage SSH's built-in authentication, encryption, and terminal capabilities without requiring traditional web infrastructure. The library includes specialized middleware for Bubble Tea TUI applications, Git server functionality, logging, and access control, allowing developers to compose SSH-based services for developer tooling, remote applications, and terminal interfaces. Targeted at Go developers in the DevOps and developer tooling space, Wish abstracts SSH protocol complexities while providing the flexibility to build applications like Git servers, interactive terminal programs, and secure remote services that users can access through standard SSH clients.
