`charmbracelet/wish` is a Go library and SSH server framework enabling the creation of custom SSH applications. It provides middleware for building SSH-based applications, including support for Bubble Tea TUIs, Git server functionality, connection logging, and access control. Built upon the `gliderlabs/ssh` library, it allows developers to securely implement functionalities like remote access and service interactions over SSH, targeting developers interested in building remote-accessible applications and developer tools. The project acts as a developer productivity library, as a standalone CLI application, and as a base for other SSH-based apps, with sensible defaults and examples.
