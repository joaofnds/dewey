Shelisp is a Common Lisp library that provides seamless integration between Common Lisp REPLs and Unix shell environments, targeting system administrators and Lisp developers who need to execute shell commands within their Lisp workflows. The library implements custom reader macros including bang syntax (`!`) for direct shell command execution, square bracket notation (`[]`) for embedded bash scripts, and question mark escaping (`?`) for embedding Lisp expressions within shell commands. It features bidirectional evaluation where Lisp code can be interpolated into shell scripts and shell output can be captured as Lisp strings, along with template systems for generating dynamic content and a `sh` macro for Lisp-syntax shell calls. The tool addresses the common need for DevOps automation and system scripting tasks where both shell utilities and Lisp's computational capabilities are required together.
