`Elixir Koans` provides interactive learning exercises for the Elixir programming language, structured as a series of challenges to familiarize users with core features and idiomatic Elixir usage. It functions as a command-line application that guides users through these exercises, with an autorunner providing feedback on code correctness, encouraging hands-on learning. The project relies on Elixir as the primary language, utilizing the `mix` build tool for dependency management and execution. This project serves as an educational tool aimed at individuals learning the Elixir language.
