Elixir Koans is an interactive educational framework designed to teach the Elixir programming language through hands-on coding exercises following the koans learning methodology. Built for software developers seeking to learn functional programming concepts and Elixir-specific idioms, the repository provides a structured curriculum of failing tests that learners must fix by implementing correct Elixir syntax and patterns. The framework includes an automated test runner with file-watching capabilities, Mix task integration, and progressive lesson navigation, covering core Elixir features like pattern matching, immutability, and concurrent programming constructs. Target users are developers transitioning from object-oriented languages to functional programming paradigms, particularly those interested in building fault-tolerant distributed systems using the Erlang VM ecosystem for web development, real-time applications, and backend services.
