`RealWorld` is an exemplary project showcasing full-stack web application implementations using various frontend (React, Angular, etc.) and backend (Node, Django, etc.) technologies, serving as a practical demonstration of building real-world applications beyond basic "todo" examples. The project allows developers to explore diverse technology stacks by providing a standardized API specification and UI/UX consistency through a shared Bootstrap 4 theme, facilitating modular frontend and backend implementations. It functions as a collection of example applications and a template for building new ones, targeting frontend and backend developers interested in comparing and learning different full-stack web development approaches. The project leverages TypeScript for its implementations.
