The `panda` repository provides firmware and a Python library for interacting with the comma.ai panda, a hardware interface for automotive CAN bus communication. Written in C and targeting STM32 microcontrollers, the firmware speaks CAN and CAN FD protocols and enforces openpilot safety models. The project includes a Python library for userspace interaction, comprehensive testing including MISRA C:2012 compliance, and hardware-in-the-loop testing to ensure functionality. This project is a library and firmware package focused on enabling CAN bus access for automotive applications, specifically targeting developers and researchers working with vehicle data and control systems.
