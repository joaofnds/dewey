The commaai/panda repository implements firmware and drivers for a CAN (Controller Area Network) bus interface device used in automotive applications. Built primarily in C for STM32F413 and STM32H725 microcontrollers, it enables communication with vehicle CAN and CAN FD networks through USB connectivity. The system enforces critical safety models for autonomous driving applications, specifically designed to work with comma.ai's openpilot self-driving software. It includes embedded firmware with MISRA C:2012 compliance, Python libraries for userspace interaction, and comprehensive hardware-in-the-loop testing. The platform targets automotive engineers, autonomous vehicle developers, and researchers working on vehicle communication protocols, providing secure CAN message transmission, reception, and forwarding capabilities with built-in safety enforcement mechanisms for production autonomous driving systems.
