**Abstract:**

`dashbitco/flow` is an Elixir library for parallel computation flows built on top of GenStage. It enables developers to execute computations on collections in a parallel manner using multiple GenStage processes. The primary function of this library lies in solving data processing problems that require high-performance, concurrent execution.

Key features include the ability to express computations similar to Elixir's Enum and Stream modules, with the added benefit of parallel execution for improved performance. Users can leverage pipelines to perform complex transformations on large datasets efficiently.

The technology stack consists of Elixir (version 1.7 and above) and Erlang/OTP 22+. The library is designed as a computational flow, making it a valuable addition to any Elixir project requiring parallel processing capabilities.

Target users include Elixir developers seeking to optimize their data processing workflows for improved performance without sacrificing readability or maintainability. By leveraging the power of GenStage and Elixir's concurrency model, `dashbitco/flow` offers a unique solution for handling large-scale data processing tasks in an efficient manner.
