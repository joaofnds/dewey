Flow is a parallel computation library for Elixir that enables developers to perform collection processing operations similar to Enum and Stream modules, but with concurrent execution across multiple GenStage processes. Built on top of Elixir's GenStage framework, it targets backend developers working with data processing, stream processing, and high-throughput applications who need to leverage BEAM VM's actor model for parallel computation. The library provides functional programming constructs like map, reduce, and partition operations that automatically distribute work across multiple stages, making it particularly valuable for processing large datasets, log analysis, and real-time data transformation pipelines where performance and fault-tolerance are critical requirements in concurrent systems.
