z is a shell script utility for Unix-like systems that implements intelligent directory navigation through frecency-based tracking. Written in Shell script for bash and zsh environments, it automatically monitors directory access patterns and maintains a weighted database combining frequency and recency metrics. The tool enables rapid filesystem traversal by matching regex patterns against historically visited paths, eliminating repetitive `cd` commands for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and command-line power users. It integrates with shell prompt hooks (PROMPT_COMMAND/precmd_functions) to continuously track directory changes, stores weighted path data in ~/.z, and supports features like tab completion, rank-based aging algorithms, and configurable exclusion patterns, primarily targeting terminal-heavy workflows in software development and system administration domains.
