Manifest is a Common Lisp documentation generation system that automatically extracts and presents API documentation from Lisp packages by introspecting exported symbols. Targeting Common Lisp developers and library maintainers in the software development domain, it addresses the problem of maintaining up-to-date documentation for Lisp codebases by leveraging the language's reflective capabilities to discover functions, macros, variables, and other exported symbols. The system operates as a web-based documentation browser, automatically starting a local HTTP server to serve the generated documentation interface. It serves developers working in the Lisp ecosystem who need to document their packages and APIs without manually maintaining separate documentation files, ensuring that all exported symbols are properly documented by making implicit code structure and metadata explicitly accessible through a web interface.
