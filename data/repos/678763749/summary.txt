This repository, frankroeder/parrot.nvim, is a Lua plugin for Neovim that integrates various large language models (LLMs) APIs into text editing workflows, focusing solely on text generation. Key features include on-demand text completion and chat-like sessions within native Neovim buffers, with persistent conversations stored as markdown files. The plugin supports multiple providers such as Anthropic API, Perplexity.ai API, OpenAI API, Mistral API, Gemini API, Groq API, local and offline serving via ollama, GitHub Models, NVIDIA API, xAI API, and DeepSeek API. It offers flexible API credential management from environment variables, bash commands, and password manager CLIs. The plugin does not provide autocompletion or hidden background requests to analyze files. This project is under development, with substantial code based on an early fork of Tibor Schmidt's gp.nvim.
