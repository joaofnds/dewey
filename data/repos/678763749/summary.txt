parrot.nvim is a Neovim plugin that integrates multiple Large Language Model (LLM) APIs directly into the text editing workflow for developers. Built in Lua, it provides seamless access to AI services including OpenAI GPT models, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Perplexity, and local Ollama instances for on-demand text completion, code generation, and inline editing within Neovim buffers. The plugin enables chat-like sessions stored as markdown files, custom hooks for text transformation based on user instructions, and repository-specific context via `.parrot.md` files. It supports flexible credential management through environment variables and password managers while explicitly avoiding background file analysis or autocompletion features. Target users are software developers and technical writers who want to leverage LLM capabilities for code completion, debugging, documentation, and text editing without leaving their Neovim editor environment.
