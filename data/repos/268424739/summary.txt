Helix is a modal text editor written in Rust that implements a Kakoune-inspired editing model with Vim-like keybindings for software developers and system administrators. It targets the code editing domain across multiple programming languages, featuring built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration for intelligent code completion and error detection, tree-sitter-powered syntax highlighting for accurate parsing, and multiple cursor selection capabilities. The editor runs primarily in terminal environments and addresses the need for a modern, performant alternative to traditional modal editors like Vim and Emacs. Its Rust implementation ensures memory safety and high performance while providing extensible language support through runtime query definitions and indentation rules for various programming languages.
