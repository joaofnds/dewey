fklearn is a functional programming-based machine learning library designed for production-ready data science workflows, developed by Nubank for Python environments. It addresses the gap between model validation and production deployment by applying functional programming principles to ensure validated models directly match production implementations. The library targets data scientists and ML engineers working on real-world machine learning pipelines, emphasizing reproducibility, production readiness, and realistic validation scenarios. Built as an alternative approach to scikit-learn's object-oriented paradigm, fklearn focuses on solving practical ML deployment challenges where model consistency between development and production environments is critical, particularly in financial services and enterprise data science applications requiring robust, reproducible ML workflows.
