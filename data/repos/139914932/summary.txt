Quarkus is a cloud-native Java framework designed for building containerized microservices and cloud applications. It targets enterprise Java developers working in Kubernetes and container-first environments, addressing the traditional challenges of Java's slow startup times and high memory consumption in cloud deployments. The framework integrates established Java standards including JAX-RS, JPA/Hibernate, Eclipse Vert.x, and MicroProfile while supporting both imperative and reactive programming models. Quarkus employs ahead-of-time compilation and build-time optimization to achieve fast startup times and reduced memory footprint, making Java applications more suitable for serverless, microservices, and cloud-native architectures where quick scaling and resource efficiency are critical.
