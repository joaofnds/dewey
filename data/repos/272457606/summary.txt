Cosmopolitan Libc is a C library that enables "build-once, run-anywhere" functionality for C/C++ code, generating a POSIX-compliant polyglot executable format that runs natively across Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and BIOS. It reconfigures GCC and Clang to produce a single binary, eliminating the need for interpreters or virtual machines. Key functionalities include a cross-platform standard library, system call tracing and function call logging for debugging, and support for building and integrating with conventional build systems. This project provides a developer tool, specifically a compiler, to generate portable executables.
