Cosmopolitan Libc is a cross-platform C standard library that enables developers to compile C/C++ programs once and run them natively across multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD) and boot environments (BIOS, EFI) without requiring interpreters or virtual machines. The project targets systems programmers and application developers working in native code development, addressing the traditional problem of platform-specific compilation and distribution in C/C++ development. It uses a POSIX-approved polyglot executable format called Actually Portable Executable (APE) that embeds multiple platform-specific loaders within a single binary, integrating with GCC and Clang toolchains through the cosmocc compiler wrapper to produce universally executable binaries with minimal overhead and comprehensive debugging capabilities.
