Babel is a JavaScript transpiler/compiler that transforms modern ECMAScript code (ES2015/ES6+) into backward-compatible JavaScript for older browsers and environments. Built with TypeScript, it operates on Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to parse, transform, and generate JavaScript code through a plugin-based architecture. The tool addresses the compatibility gap between cutting-edge JavaScript language features and production browser support, enabling web developers to use modern syntax, async/await, JSX, TypeScript, and experimental ECMAScript proposals while maintaining cross-browser compatibility. Babel serves as a critical build tool in the web development ecosystem, integrating with bundlers like Webpack and being essential for React, Vue, and other modern JavaScript framework development workflows.
