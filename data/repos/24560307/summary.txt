Babel is a TypeScript-based compiler and developer tool that transforms JavaScript code, enabling the use of next-generation JavaScript features across various browser environments. It compiles modern JavaScript, including ES2015+ features, down to versions compatible with older browsers, facilitating cross-browser compatibility. The project, maintained as a monorepo, features an abstract syntax tree (AST) for code manipulation and provides plugins for extensive customization. Primarily a library, Babel is intended for use by JavaScript developers to enhance their web development workflows.
