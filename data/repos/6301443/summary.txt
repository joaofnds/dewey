clojure.data.generators is an official Clojure library that provides random data generation capabilities for testing and development workflows. Built specifically for the Clojure ecosystem, it generates pseudo-random primitive values, collections, and complex data structures commonly used in functional programming and data processing applications. The library serves software developers working with Clojure/ClojureScript projects who need deterministic yet varied test data for property-based testing, unit testing, benchmarking, and development fixtures. It integrates seamlessly with Clojure's immutable data structures and functional programming paradigms, offering generators for strings, numbers, collections, maps, and custom data types. This tool is particularly valuable for developers practicing test-driven development, implementing generative testing strategies, or requiring realistic sample data for application prototyping and performance testing scenarios.
