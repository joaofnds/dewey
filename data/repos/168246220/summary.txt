This repository serves as a personal experimentation lab focused on containerized infrastructure and DevOps automation, primarily targeting system administrators and DevOps engineers working with Docker-based deployments. The codebase demonstrates practical implementations of Docker Swarm orchestration, container secrets management, and reverse proxy configurations using Caddy and Nginx. Key technical contributions include automated Docker secrets-to-environment variable conversion, zero-downtime deployment patterns with automatic rollback capabilities, and production-ready Flask application scaling within Docker Swarm clusters. The experiments address common DevOps challenges around container orchestration, secure secrets handling, and high-availability web service deployment, providing reference implementations for infrastructure automation and containerized application lifecycle management using Shell scripting and Docker ecosystem tools.
