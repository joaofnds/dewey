**gomeboycolor** is a Nintendo Game Boy Color hardware emulator implemented in Go that serves as a backend library for retro gaming applications. The project targets game development and emulation enthusiasts by providing low-level hardware emulation including CPU instruction processing, memory management, and graphics rendering. It implements a modular architecture where the core emulation engine is decoupled from frontend rendering, allowing integration with various display technologies including native desktop applications (via libglfw), web browsers (through WebAssembly), and terminal interfaces (using tcell). The emulator successfully passes blargg CPU and memory timing test suites, supports battery save functionality for persistent game states, and handles multiple Memory Bank Controller (MBC) types, though it currently lacks audio implementation and real-time clock support for MBC3 cartridges.
