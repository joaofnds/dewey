`gomeboycolor` is a Go-based library providing a core emulator runtime for the Nintendo Gameboy Color. It focuses on emulating the hardware and provides features like battery save support for compatible ROMs, passing blargg CPU and memory timing tests. Designed to be used with a frontend, it allows developers to render the emulated game and handle user input; example frontends are available utilizing GLFW for native windowing, WebAssembly for browser support, and tcell for terminal-based rendering. This project is a library aimed at developers interested in game emulation and retro gaming.
