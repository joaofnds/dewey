**lowdb** is a lightweight, file-based JSON database library for JavaScript/TypeScript applications, designed for Node.js, Electron, and browser environments. It provides a simple API for persisting application data as JSON files with atomic write operations, targeting web developers who need embedded storage without complex database setup. The library supports synchronous and asynchronous operations, integrates with localStorage/sessionStorage for browser applications, and offers TypeScript support with customizable adapters for different storage backends (JSON, YAML) and serialization formats. It solves the common problem of local data persistence in JavaScript applications, particularly useful for prototyping, desktop applications, CLI tools, and scenarios requiring simple key-value storage with the ability to query data using native JavaScript Array methods and optional Lodash integration for advanced data manipulation.
