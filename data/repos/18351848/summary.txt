`lowdb` is a lightweight, embeddable JavaScript JSON database library, providing a simple and fast local storage solution. It enables users to read, write, and query JSON data using familiar JavaScript array methods and native functionality, making it easy to integrate within JavaScript projects, including Node.js and Electron applications. Core features include atomic write operations, TypeScript support for data type checking, and flexible adapter options for various storage methods, including file-based (JSON, YAML), in-memory, and browser-based local/session storage. This library is primarily designed for JavaScript developers seeking an embedded database solution for smaller projects or prototyping, functioning as a local storage alternative to more complex database systems.
