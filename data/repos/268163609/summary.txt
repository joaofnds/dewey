Qdrant is a high-performance vector database and similarity search engine written in Rust, designed for AI and machine learning applications. It enables storage, indexing, and retrieval of high-dimensional vector embeddings with sub-second query performance using algorithms like HNSW for approximate nearest neighbor search. The system supports hybrid search combining dense and sparse vectors, payload-based filtering with JSON metadata, horizontal scaling through sharding and replication, and vector quantization for memory optimization. Target users include ML engineers, data scientists, and AI developers building semantic search, recommendation systems, image search, RAG applications, and neural network-based matching systems. Qdrant provides REST and gRPC APIs with official clients for Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, Java, and .NET, integrating with ML frameworks like LangChain, Haystack, and Cohere for production-ready vector similarity search infrastructure.
