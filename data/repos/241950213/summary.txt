Fusebox is a lightweight fault tolerance library for Clojure, ClojureScript, and Babashka designed for distributed systems and microservices architectures. It provides essential resilience patterns including circuit breakers, bulkheads, rate limiters, retries, timeouts, fallbacks, and memoization to handle network latency, service failures, and resource contention in web applications and API integrations. The library emphasizes simplicity with pure functions, sequential execution (no callbacks), and immutable data structures, contrasting with heavyweight Java alternatives like Resilience4J. It uses namespaced keywords for configuration and has minimal dependencies (only clojure/tools.logging). Target users are backend developers building distributed systems, microservices, or any applications making network calls who need to implement fault tolerance patterns without complex execution models or extensive configuration overhead.
