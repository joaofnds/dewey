Fusebox is a lightweight fault tolerance library designed for Clojure(Script) and Babashka, providing utilities to enhance application resilience against latency and errors in network-dependent systems. Core functionalities include circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, rate limiting, timeouts, fallbacks, and bulkheads, enabling developers to manage concurrency, handle failures, and control resource usage. Built upon Clojure, the library leverages immutable data structures, namespaced keys, and simple, modular design with ClojureScript support, using clojure/tools.logging as its primary dependency. Fusebox is a library primarily intended for Clojure developers working on applications interacting with external services.
