**mu4e-dashboard** is an Emacs Lisp extension that creates customizable email management dashboards for mu4e (mu for Emacs) mail client users. It implements a new org-mode link type with syntax `[[mu:query|format|count][description]]` that executes mu4e search queries when clicked, enabling users to organize email workflows within org-mode documents. The tool supports mu4e bookmark integration, dynamic query result counting with format strings, custom keybindings via `#+KEYMAP` keywords, and org-babel integration for query testing. It addresses the need for centralized email dashboard interfaces in text-based email workflows, targeting Emacs power users, system administrators, and developers who prefer terminal-based email management over GUI clients, particularly those already using org-mode for task and information management.
