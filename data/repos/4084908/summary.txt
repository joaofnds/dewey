Realm Java is a mobile-first NoSQL database engine designed as a drop-in replacement for SQLite and traditional ORMs in Android applications. Built specifically for mobile development, it provides direct object-to-database mapping without requiring complex ORM layers, offering thread-safe operations, encryption, and real-time synchronization capabilities through Atlas Device Sync. The repository implements a Java SDK that integrates with Android projects via Gradle, targeting mobile developers who need performant local data persistence with optional cloud synchronization. Key features include faster-than-SQLite performance, automatic relationship handling, and seamless integration with Android's development ecosystem. Note that this SDK has been deprecated in favor of the newer Realm Kotlin SDK for new projects.
