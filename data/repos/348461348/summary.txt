This Emacs Lisp package provides thesaurus functionality within the Emacs text editor by integrating with Thesaurus.com's API to retrieve synonyms and antonyms for selected words. Targeting writers, content creators, and developers working on documentation or text-heavy projects within the Emacs ecosystem, the package implements cursor-based word lookup through interactive commands `le-thesaurus-get-synonyms` and `le-thesaurus-get-antonyms` with completion buffer interfaces for word selection. Built using standard Emacs Lisp HTTP request capabilities, it includes response caching mechanisms to optimize API usage and utilizes the Buttercup testing framework for quality assurance. The package addresses the common workflow interruption of switching between text editors and external thesaurus tools, enabling seamless vocabulary enhancement directly within the Emacs editing environment, though it's currently deprecated due to API endpoint failures.
