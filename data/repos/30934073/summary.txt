The `biz` gem is a Ruby library designed for performing precise business time calculations within enterprise applications, particularly customer service and support systems. It enables developers to calculate time intervals that respect business hours, holidays, breaks, and shift schedules with second-level precision. The library handles complex scheduling scenarios including multiple daily intervals, timezone conversions with automatic Daylight Saving Time adjustments, and schedule intersections. Key features include thread-safe operations, configurable business rules through YAML-like configuration, and methods for determining business time duration between dates, finding next/previous business hours, and validating whether specific times fall within operational periods. Built without ActiveSupport dependencies, it targets Ruby developers building SaaS platforms, helpdesk systems, and enterprise software requiring accurate business time computation for SLA tracking, response time calculations, and operational scheduling.
