org-fragtog is an Emacs Lisp package that automatically manages LaTeX fragment preview rendering in Org mode documents. It provides cursor-based toggling functionality that disables inline LaTeX fragment previews when the cursor enters them (enabling editing) and re-enables visual rendering when the cursor exits. The package hooks into Org mode's existing LaTeX preview system and works with any content using compatible fragment syntax, including Markdown files and code comments. Targeted at academic researchers, technical writers, and developers who frequently work with mathematical notation in Emacs, it solves the workflow friction of manually toggling LaTeX previews during document editing. The solution integrates seamlessly with the Emacs ecosystem and Org mode's built-in LaTeX processing capabilities.
