anne-key is an alternative firmware implementation for the Anne Pro mechanical keyboard written in Rust for embedded systems. This project targets the hardware/embedded development domain, specifically mechanical keyboard enthusiasts and embedded developers who want more stable and feature-rich firmware than the original manufacturer software. The firmware provides core keyboard functionality including Bluetooth HID communication, LED control, USB charging, and partial compatibility with existing Anne Pro applications. Built using Rust's embedded ecosystem, it addresses firmware stability issues and enables custom features through direct hardware control of the STM32-based keyboard controller. The project serves embedded developers, keyboard modding communities, and users seeking open-source alternatives to proprietary keyboard firmware, utilizing DFU (Device Firmware Update) protocol for flashing and low-level hardware abstraction layers for peripheral control.
