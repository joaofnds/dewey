The `stellar/go` repository is a Go-based monorepo providing tools and SDKs for interacting with the Stellar network, a blockchain-based platform for digital assets. It offers functionalities including a Horizon server (API server), SDKs for client interactions (horizonclient, txnbuild), and services such as a ticker, keystore, compliance server, and federation server. Key features include constructing Stellar transactions, managing keys, and providing services for anchors and financial institutions. This project functions primarily as a collection of libraries, API servers, and command-line applications, targeting developers building applications that integrate with the Stellar network, leveraging the Go programming language.
