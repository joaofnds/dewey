This is Stellar's official Go monorepo containing blockchain infrastructure components and SDKs for the Stellar cryptocurrency network. It provides core services including Horizon (a full-featured REST API server for blockchain queries and transaction submission), transaction building libraries (txnbuild), and specialized servers for financial institutions like compliance and federation services. The repository targets blockchain developers and financial institutions building applications that integrate with Stellar's distributed ledger, offering client SDKs (horizonclient), market statistics APIs (ticker), and key management services (keystore). Built entirely in Go with extensive use of HTTP handlers, protobuf definitions, and modular architecture, it serves as the primary development toolkit for creating Stellar network applications, enabling cryptocurrency transactions, asset management, and cross-border payment solutions.
