RSpec Mode is an Emacs Lisp package that provides IDE-like functionality for Ruby developers working with RSpec testing framework. It offers a minor mode that integrates RSpec test execution directly into the Emacs editor environment, enabling developers to run individual specs, toggle between test files and implementation code, execute full test suites, and navigate between methods and their corresponding test examples. The package supports various Ruby environment management tools including RVM, Docker, and Vagrant, and provides debugging integration through inf-ruby for tools like binding.pry and byebug. Primary users are Ruby developers who prefer Emacs as their development environment and need streamlined workflows for test-driven development and behavior-driven development practices using RSpec.
