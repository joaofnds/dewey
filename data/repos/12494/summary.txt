`rspec-mode` is an Emacs minor mode designed to enhance Ruby development by providing convenient integrations with the RSpec testing framework. It facilitates running RSpec tests directly from within Emacs, offering keybindings for verifying spec files, running tests for entire projects or specific examples, and navigating between code and tests. Implemented in Emacs Lisp, `rspec-mode` automatically activates in `ruby-mode` and supports features like RVM and Docker integration for diverse development environments, alongside hooks for custom pre- and post-verification actions. This project is a plugin/extension targeting Ruby developers utilizing Emacs for their development workflow, enhancing their ability to manage and execute RSpec tests.
