The keycloak-nodejs-connect repository provides a Node.js adapter for integrating Keycloak identity and access management (IAM) into Connect-compatible web applications. Built for the web development domain, this JavaScript library enables Node.js developers to implement authentication and authorization using Keycloak's open-source IAM platform. The adapter abstracts the complexity of OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect protocols, allowing seamless integration with Express.js and other Connect-based frameworks. It addresses the common problem of implementing secure user authentication, session management, and role-based access control in Node.js web applications without building custom authentication systems. However, the package is officially deprecated, indicating users should migrate to alternative Keycloak integration solutions for future projects.
