Polybar is a standalone C++ application designed to create customizable status bars for Linux desktop environments, primarily targeting window managers like i3wm and bspwm. It provides modules for displaying various system and application information, including systray icons, window titles, audio controls, workspace indicators, CPU and memory usage, and network status. The software is highly configurable and aims to simplify the creation of aesthetically pleasing status bars through built-in functionality rather than requiring extensive shell scripting.
