Polybar is a C++ desktop status bar application designed for Linux window manager environments, specifically targeting users of tiling window managers like i3wm and bspwm. Built on X11 foundations, it provides a customizable system information display layer that integrates with various Linux subsystems including ALSA/PulseAudio for audio control, MPD for music playback, EWMH-compliant window managers for workspace management, and system monitoring for CPU/memory/battery status. The application serves Linux power users, system administrators, and desktop environment customizers who require lightweight, scriptable status bars without complex shell scripting knowledge. It addresses the need for unified system information aggregation and display in minimal desktop environments where traditional desktop panels are absent or inadequate.
