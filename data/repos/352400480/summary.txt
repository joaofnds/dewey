`dnspeep` is a standalone, command-line application written in Rust designed to monitor and display DNS queries made by a computer. It captures DNS packets using `libpcap` on port 53, correlating requests and responses to show them together, also identifying queries that did not receive a response. The tool supports a subset of DNS query types as defined by the `dns-message-parser` crate and utilizes UDP for DNS queries, while acknowledging limitations regarding TCP and DNS-over-HTTPS support. It is a developer tool, primarily for system administrators and network engineers who require insight into DNS traffic.
