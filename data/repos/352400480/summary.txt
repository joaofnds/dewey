**dnspeep** is a network monitoring tool written in Rust that provides real-time visibility into DNS queries made by local systems. Targeted at system administrators, network engineers, and security professionals, it uses libpcap for packet capture on port 53 to intercept UDP DNS traffic, matching queries with their corresponding responses and displaying them in a unified format. The tool leverages the dns-message-parser crate for DNS protocol parsing and presents query types (A, AAAA, CNAME), target domains, DNS server IPs, and resolved addresses in tabular output. It addresses the networking and DevOps domain need for DNS troubleshooting, network analysis, and security monitoring by exposing otherwise invisible DNS resolution activity, though it's limited to UDP queries and cannot capture DNS-over-HTTPS traffic.
