cmp-path is a Lua-based completion source plugin for nvim-cmp, Neovim's completion framework, specifically designed to provide filesystem path autocompletion within the text editor. This plugin serves software developers and system administrators who work extensively with file operations, configuration management, and code editing in Neovim. It integrates with the nvim-cmp ecosystem to offer intelligent path suggestions as users type file or directory paths, supporting configurable options like trailing slash handling for directories, customizable working directory resolution, and completion menu formatting. The plugin addresses the common developer workflow pain point of manually typing or remembering complex filesystem paths during coding, script writing, and file manipulation tasks, enhancing productivity in terminal-based development environments.
