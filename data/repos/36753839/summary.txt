Open MCT is a web-based mission control framework developed by NASA for visualizing telemetry data from spacecraft missions and rover systems. Built with JavaScript, it enables the creation of desktop and mobile applications for data analysis, planning, and operation of systems generating telemetry. Key features include data visualization, plugin extensibility for custom functionality, and a modular architecture based on plugins.  This framework is designed to be generalized for use with diverse telemetry data sources, making it suitable for applications beyond the space domain and is targeted towards developers and engineers.
