Open MCT is a JavaScript-based web framework for building mission control and telemetry visualization applications, developed by NASA for spacecraft missions and rover systems. Built with Node.js and webpack, it provides a plugin-based architecture for creating real-time data monitoring dashboards that run on desktop and mobile browsers. The framework targets aerospace engineers, mission control operators, and developers who need to visualize and analyze streaming telemetry data from spacecraft, satellites, or other instrumented systems. It implements domain objects for hierarchical data organization, supports real-time data binding, and offers extensible visualization components for time-series plots, system schematics, and operational displays. The codebase includes comprehensive testing with Jasmine, Karma, and Playwright for unit, e2e, and visual regression testing.
