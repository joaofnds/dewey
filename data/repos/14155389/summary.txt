ClojureScript Koans Online is an interactive, browser-based educational platform designed to teach ClojureScript programming fundamentals through guided exercises called "koans." Built with ClojureScript and compiled to run entirely in-browser, it eliminates the need for local Clojure development environment setup. The project uses Leiningen for build management, Sass/Compass for stylesheet compilation, and implements a fill-in-the-blank learning methodology where students complete code expressions marked with `:__` placeholders. Targeting web developers and functional programming newcomers, it addresses the barrier-to-entry problem in ClojureScript learning by providing an immediately accessible, zero-configuration educational environment. The koans are structured as sequences of description strings paired with S-expressions, automatically syntax-highlighted and evaluated in real-time to provide immediate feedback on student progress.
