`clojurescript-koans` provides an interactive, in-browser learning environment for ClojureScript, adapting the Clojure Koans for educational purposes. Users can learn ClojureScript by solving code challenges ("koans") within a web application, eliminating the need for a local Clojure development environment. The project utilizes ClojureScript for frontend execution, potentially with Leiningen for build management, and Sass/Compass for styling, with a focus on interactive code exercises and immediate feedback within the browser. It functions as a standalone web application, targeting individuals seeking to learn ClojureScript interactively.
