This Go repository, `microsoft/typescript-go`, is a development stage project for a native port of TypeScript. It aims to provide a TypeScript compiler (`tsgo`) that can be used as an alternative to the original TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). The project leverages Go 1.24 or higher, Rust 1.85 or higher, Node.js with npm, and `hereby`. It offers a preview build on npm and a corresponding VS Code extension for seamless integration into the development workflow. While not yet at full feature parity with TypeScript, it supports program creation, parsing/scanning, type resolution, type checking, and language service (LSP) prototype functionality. This project is primarily intended for developers working in the domain of web development who are interested in using a Go-based implementation of TypeScript.
