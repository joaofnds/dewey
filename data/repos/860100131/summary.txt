Microsoft's typescript-go is a native port of the TypeScript compiler and language service infrastructure implemented in Go, targeting web development and JavaScript/TypeScript tooling. This project reimplements the TypeScript 7 compiler (`tsgo`) as a drop-in replacement for `tsc`, featuring complete parsing, type checking, and syntax error detection with exact parity to TypeScript 5.8, plus a prototype Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for IDE integration. Built using Go 1.24+, Rust 1.85+, and Node.js, it addresses performance and deployment concerns of the original JavaScript-based TypeScript compiler while maintaining full compatibility with existing TypeScript codebases, tsconfig.json configurations, and module resolution. The target users are TypeScript/JavaScript developers, tooling authors, and IDE extension developers seeking improved compiler performance and native binary distribution capabilities.
