`miniC-hosting` is an interactive, in-browser tutorial and virtual machine implementation focusing on C language compilation and execution. Written in JavaScript, it allows users to explore compiler internals by executing a simplified C dialect within a stack-based virtual machine. Key functionalities include an interactive sandbox environment, a step-by-step tutorial covering expressions, variables, and program structure, and a detailed virtual instruction set. This project serves as a learning tool for understanding compiler design and the execution of compiled code, targeting individuals interested in computer science fundamentals.
