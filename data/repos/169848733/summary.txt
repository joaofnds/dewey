MiniC-hosting is a browser-based educational compiler and virtual machine implementation that executes a subset of C language through JavaScript. The system features a stack-based VM with custom instruction set architecture (ISA) including operations like PUSH, LEA, DRF, JMP, and function call mechanisms (FSTART, RET, CALL). Targeted at computer science education and compiler theory learning, it provides an interactive tutorial environment that visualizes compilation processes from C source code to bytecode execution. The project addresses the complexity barrier in understanding compiler design by offering a simplified yet complete toolchain demonstration. Primary users include programming students, educators teaching compiler construction, and developers seeking to understand low-level language implementation concepts without dealing with native compilation complexities.
