This repository serves as a comprehensive educational reference for x86-64 assembly language programming, providing structured code examples that demonstrate core assembly concepts. Targeting the systems programming and low-level development domain, it covers essential topics through working examples written for both GNU Assembler (AT&T and Intel syntax) and NASM assembler, adhering to the System V Application Binary Interface specification. Each concept is accompanied by C-based test cases to validate functionality and demonstrate practical integration between high-level and assembly code. The repository addresses the learning curve challenges faced by systems programmers, embedded developers, compiler engineers, and computer science students who need to understand processor-level programming, performance optimization, and the interface between compiled languages and machine code.
