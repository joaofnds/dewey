This repository provides a reference guide for x86-64 assembly language concepts, featuring working code examples. It illustrates key assembly concepts through small, executable programs, enabling users to learn and practice assembly programming. The examples are written for the GNU Assembler (AT&T and Intel syntax) and NASM, adhering to the System V Application Binary Interface, complemented by tests written in C. It functions as an educational resource and code reference, serving as a learning tool for developers seeking fluency in x86-64 assembly.
