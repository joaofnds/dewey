CL-PPCRE is a portable regular expression engine implementation for Common Lisp that provides Perl-compatible regex functionality across ANSI-compliant Lisp systems. The library targets Common Lisp developers working in domains requiring pattern matching, text processing, and string manipulation, including bioinformatics, web development, and data parsing applications. It offers both traditional string-based regex syntax and native S-expression pattern definitions, enabling seamless integration with Lisp codebases while maintaining thread safety and cross-platform portability. The engine solves the problem of regex standardization in the Common Lisp ecosystem, providing a high-performance alternative to implementation-specific regex facilities for developers building text-intensive applications, parsers, and data processing systems.
