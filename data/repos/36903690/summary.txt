Noto Emoji is an open-source Unicode-compliant emoji font library developed by Google Fonts that provides cross-platform emoji rendering capabilities for web and mobile applications. Built primarily with Python tooling, it generates color emoji fonts using the CBDT/CBLC format supported by Android, Chrome OS, and modern browsers, along with monochrome variable fonts for broader compatibility. The repository contains font build tools, SVG and PNG emoji assets, and metadata for emoji input systems including shortcodes and ordering. It addresses the fundamental problem of consistent emoji display across different operating systems and browsers, targeting frontend developers, font engineers, and application developers who need reliable Unicode emoji support in their web applications, mobile apps, and desktop software.
