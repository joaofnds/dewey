The `googlefonts/noto-emoji` repository provides an open-source library for Unicode emoji support, specifically focused on delivering the Noto Emoji fonts. Key functionalities include a Unicode-compliant color emoji font (`NotoColorEmoji.ttf`), a monochrome variable font, and a full library of emoji resources like SVG and PNG files. This project is primarily a font library, along with associated metadata for emoji input, supporting the CBDT/CBLC color font format for compatibility with operating systems such as Android, Chrome OS, Windows, and Linux. This library is built with Python and is aimed at developers and designers seeking to incorporate standard Unicode emoji support within their projects.
