date-fns is a comprehensive JavaScript date manipulation library built in TypeScript that provides over 200 modular utility functions for parsing, formatting, comparing, and calculating dates and times. Targeting web developers and Node.js applications, it serves as a modern alternative to legacy date libraries by offering immutable, pure functions that work with native JavaScript Date objects without extending core prototypes. The library addresses common date handling challenges in frontend and backend JavaScript development through features like internationalization support, tree-shaking compatibility, first-class time zone support, and consistent API design. It integrates seamlessly with modern build tools like webpack, Rollup, and Browserify, making it suitable for developers building web applications, APIs, and JavaScript-based systems requiring robust date manipulation capabilities.
