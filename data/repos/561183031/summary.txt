`blink` is a tiny, high-performance x86-64-linux emulator designed to execute Linux binaries on various POSIX systems. It functions as a virtual machine, offering a significantly smaller footprint and, in some benchmarks, faster execution than QEMU. Key functionalities include supporting multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Cygwin), providing a terminal user interface (`blinkenlights`) for debugging, and incorporating a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for improved performance. Written in C (C11 with atomics), it utilizes the x86-64 instruction set, supports several extensions (SSE2, SSE3, etc.), and incorporates a lockless hashing mechanism for JIT code management. This project is a standalone command-line application and a developer productivity tool aimed at enabling cross-platform execution and debugging of x86-64 Linux binaries.
