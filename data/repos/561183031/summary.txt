Blink is a lightweight x86-64 Linux emulator written in C that enables cross-platform execution of Linux binaries on POSIX systems including macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and various Linux architectures (ARM, RISC-V, MIPS, PowerPC). At 221KB, it serves as a compact alternative to QEMU's qemu-x86_64 (4MB), targeting system administrators, embedded developers, and cross-platform deployment scenarios. The emulator includes JIT compilation, instruction set emulation for x86-64/i8086, and features a terminal-based debugger called Blinkenlights with reverse debugging capabilities. Built with C11 and requiring only POSIX.1-2017 libraries, Blink addresses virtualization and binary compatibility challenges in heterogeneous computing environments, particularly for running Linux toolchains and applications on non-Linux systems without full virtualization overhead.
