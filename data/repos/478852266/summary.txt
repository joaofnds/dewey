Goose is a Clojure-based background job processing library designed for web application and distributed systems development. It provides asynchronous task execution with native support for RabbitMQ and Redis message brokers, enabling reliable job queuing, scheduling, and batch processing. The library features pluggable broker architecture, cron job scheduling, error handling with retries, middleware extensibility, and a management console for job monitoring. Built for concurrent and parallel processing environments, Goose addresses the common problem of decoupling time-intensive tasks from web request cycles in server-side applications. It targets Clojure developers building scalable web services and distributed systems who need robust background job processing with guaranteed message delivery and fault tolerance across code, hardware, and network failures.
