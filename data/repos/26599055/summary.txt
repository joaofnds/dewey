Cryogen is a static site generator written in Clojure designed for web developers building blogs and documentation sites. It transforms Markdown or AsciiDoc content into static HTML websites, targeting developers who prefer functional programming toolchains over Node.js-based generators like Jekyll or Gatsby. The system integrates with Clojure build tools (Leiningen, tools-deps) and provides features including code syntax highlighting, RSS feed generation, Sass/SCSS compilation, tag management, and table of contents generation. It solves the problem of creating fast, maintainable static websites while leveraging Clojure's ecosystem, making it particularly suitable for Clojure developers who want a generator that aligns with their existing development workflow and tooling preferences.
