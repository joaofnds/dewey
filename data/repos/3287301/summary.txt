LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) is a compiler infrastructure framework providing modular tools for building optimizers, code generators, and runtime environments. It operates in the systems programming and compiler development domain, offering an intermediate representation (IR) that enables language-agnostic optimization and multi-target code generation. The framework includes components for parsing, optimizing, and generating machine code across various processor architectures, supporting both ahead-of-time and just-in-time compilation. LLVM serves as the backend for numerous programming languages including C/C++ (via Clang), Swift, Rust, and Julia, solving the problem of building efficient, portable compilers without reimplementing optimization and code generation from scratch. Primary users include compiler developers, programming language designers, and systems engineers working on performance-critical applications requiring fine-grained control over code generation and optimization.
