The `llvm-mirror/llvm` repository, mirrored from the original location, represents the core LLVM project. Primarily focused on code generation, optimization, and virtual machine technology, it serves as an intermediate representation (IR) compiler infrastructure. Its functionality includes transforming source code into optimized machine code for various architectures, enabling cross-platform compilation and performance enhancements. Written in LLVM's specific language, it functions as a foundational framework and a suite of tools targeted at compiler developers and systems programmers.
