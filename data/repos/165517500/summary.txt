`ratatouille` is an Elixir library providing a declarative terminal user interface (TUI) kit for building rich text-based applications, similar to HTML-based web applications. It leverages the `termbox` API via the `ex_termbox` Elixir bindings to render the UI. Key functionalities include a view DSL for defining UI layouts with elements like rows, columns, labels, and panels, along with an Elm architecture-inspired application structure for managing state and updates via `init/1`, `update/2`, and `render/1` callbacks. This project is a library targeting Elixir developers who want to build terminal-based user interfaces, offering features like styling and support for creating both simple and complex applications.
