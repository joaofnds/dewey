Ratatouille is a declarative terminal user interface (TUI) framework for Elixir that enables developers to build rich text-based terminal applications using HTML-like syntax. Built on top of the termbox API through ex_termbox bindings, it implements The Elm Architecture (TEA) pattern with init/update/render callbacks for managing application state and UI updates. The framework provides a DSL with element builders (view, row, table, label) for creating terminal interfaces and handles keyboard/mouse events declaratively. It targets Elixir/Erlang developers building CLI tools, system monitoring applications, and interactive terminal utilities who need sophisticated text-based interfaces beyond simple command-line programs. The library integrates with OTP applications and supports distribution through standard Elixir tooling, offering an alternative to web-based dashboards for system administration and developer tooling in terminal environments.
