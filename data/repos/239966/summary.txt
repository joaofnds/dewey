It provides the functionality to load and execute NES ROMs, emulating the 6502 CPU and other NES hardware components, with features including frame rendering and audio sample generation. The library facilitates interaction with the emulated NES environment through input handling capabilities, enabling user control. Primarily targeting developers, JSNES is installable via npm or can be included directly in HTML via unpkg, offering a platform for homebrew ROM developers to embed playable NES games within web pages.
