JSNES is a JavaScript-based Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator that enables 6502 processor emulation and ROM execution in both browser and Node.js environments. Targeting retro gaming enthusiasts and web developers, it provides a complete emulation library with frame rendering callbacks, audio sample output, and controller input handling for running authentic NES ROMs. The emulator handles timing-critical operations like 60fps frame generation while delegating audio/video output and input management to the host application. Built with vanilla JavaScript and distributed via NPM, it serves homebrew game developers who want to embed playable ROM versions in web pages, emulation hobbyists building custom frontends, and developers creating browser-based retro gaming experiences without requiring additional runtime dependencies or frameworks.
