This repository implements Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton, using Javascript and HTML Canvas for visualization. It functions as a standalone web application demonstrating the Game of Life simulation. The project allows users to interactively view and explore the evolution of cellular patterns within the defined grid, utilizing Javascript for the simulation logic and Canvas for graphical rendering within a web browser.
