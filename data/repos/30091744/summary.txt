This repository implements Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton simulation, using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas for web-based visualization. Targeting the web development domain, it demonstrates fundamental concepts in computational biology, mathematical modeling, and interactive browser-based graphics programming. The implementation uses vanilla JavaScript for game logic and Canvas API for real-time rendering of cellular evolution patterns. It serves as an educational resource for developers learning algorithmic visualization, game development principles, or exploring emergent behavior simulations in web environments. The project addresses the need for accessible, browser-native implementations of classic computer science algorithms, making it valuable for computer science students, educators, and web developers interested in interactive mathematical demonstrations or seeking reference implementations for cellular automata systems.
