Navigator.lua is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides advanced code analysis and navigation capabilities for software developers across multiple programming languages. It integrates Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients with Treesitter AST parsing to deliver intelligent code browsing, symbol analysis, and diagnostic error management within the Neovim editor. The plugin offers features including reference/definition search, call hierarchy visualization, symbol highlighting, code folding, and fuzzy search functionality through floating windows and sidebars. It supports over 20 LSP configurations for languages like JavaScript, C++, Go, and others, while providing async performance optimization and workspace-wide symbol navigation. Targeted at developers seeking IDE-like functionality in Neovim, it addresses the need for efficient code exploration and context analysis in large codebases without leaving the terminal-based editor environment.
