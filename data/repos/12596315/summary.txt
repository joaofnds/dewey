`circuit-breaker-js` is a JavaScript library implementing a Hystrix-like circuit breaker, designed to improve the resilience of JavaScript applications by preventing cascading failures. It provides mechanisms to monitor the health of external services and automatically stop requests to failing services, redirecting to fallback functions. Key features include configurable timeout durations, error thresholds, and rolling window metrics for tracking service performance, alongside methods for manual control via `forceOpen`, `forceClose`, and `unforce`. This library is aimed at JavaScript developers building robust applications, particularly those interacting with external APIs or services, providing a strategy for managing service dependencies and minimizing downtime.
