This repository implements a Hystrix-inspired circuit breaker pattern for JavaScript applications, designed to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems and web services. Built for web developers working on client-side or Node.js applications, it provides fault tolerance by monitoring service calls and automatically switching to fallback behavior when error thresholds are exceeded. The library features configurable parameters including rolling window metrics collection, timeout handling, error percentage thresholds, and volume-based circuit tripping logic. It uses a statistical sliding window approach with bucketed metrics to track service health over time, automatically opening circuits when services become unreliable and closing them when they recover. The implementation targets frontend and backend JavaScript developers building resilient microservice architectures, API integrations, or any application requiring graceful degradation when external dependencies fail.
