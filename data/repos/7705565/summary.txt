Sucker Punch is a Ruby asynchronous background job processing library designed for single-process web applications, particularly targeting Rails and Sinatra developers. Built on concurrent-ruby, it provides in-memory job queuing with configurable thread pools per job class, eliminating the need for external infrastructure like Redis or databases. The library addresses the cost and complexity concerns of hosting separate background job processes on platforms like Heroku by embedding asynchronous processing directly within the web application process. It supports immediate and delayed job execution, worker pool configuration, and ActiveRecord connection pool management. Sucker Punch is optimized for non-mission-critical tasks such as email delivery, logging, and API calls where job persistence across application restarts is not required, making it ideal for Ruby web developers seeking lightweight background processing solutions.
