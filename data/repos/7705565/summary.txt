Sucker Punch is a Ruby library providing asynchronous processing capabilities within a single-process Ruby application, facilitating tasks like email sending and data processing without requiring external infrastructure like databases or message queues. Built upon `concurrent-ruby`, it implements a job-based, in-memory queue architecture where jobs are executed by individual workers. Key features include methods for asynchronous and future job execution, configuration of worker thread counts and queue sizes, and integration with Rails through an Active Job adapter. This library allows Ruby developers to implement background task processing directly within web applications, offering a lightweight alternative to more complex queuing solutions.
