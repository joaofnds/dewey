`dplyr` is an R package providing a "grammar of data manipulation" with a consistent set of verbs for common data transformation tasks. It allows users to perform operations such as variable addition (`mutate()`), variable selection (`select()`), filtering rows (`filter()`), summarizing data (`summarise()`), and reordering rows (`arrange()`). Built primarily in R, it supports multiple computational backends, including `arrow`, `dtplyr`, `dbplyr`, `duckplyr`, `duckdb`, and `sparklyr`, allowing users to work with datasets beyond in-memory frames and integrate with databases and distributed computing environments. This is a library designed to assist data scientists and analysts in data wrangling and preparation within the R ecosystem.
