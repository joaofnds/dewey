dplyr is a core R package for data manipulation and transformation, providing a grammar-based approach to common data science operations. It offers a consistent set of verbs (`mutate()`, `select()`, `filter()`, `summarise()`, `arrange()`) that can be combined with `group_by()` for grouped operations on data frames and tibbles. The package supports multiple computational backends including SQL databases (via dbplyr), Apache Arrow for large datasets, data.table integration, and distributed computing with Spark. Designed for data scientists, analysts, and R developers, dplyr abstracts complex data manipulation tasks into intuitive, chainable operations using the pipe operator, making it essential for exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and statistical preprocessing workflows within the tidyverse ecosystem.
