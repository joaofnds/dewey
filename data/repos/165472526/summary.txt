@pika/pack is a JavaScript package build tool designed for npm package authors in the web development ecosystem. It provides a plugin-based architecture that wraps popular build tools like Babel and Rollup to generate multiple distribution formats (CommonJS, ES modules, TypeScript definitions, browser bundles) from a single codebase. The tool automatically generates optimized package.json manifests with appropriate entry points, file configurations, and metadata for different consumption environments (Node.js, web, TypeScript). It addresses the complexity of modern JavaScript package distribution by eliminating manual build configuration and ensuring packages are properly formatted for various module systems and runtime environments, targeting library developers who need to support multiple JavaScript ecosystems.
