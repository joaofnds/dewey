This repository is a curated directory of technology companies that have adopted alternative technical interviewing practices, eliminating traditional whiteboard coding interviews and CS trivia questions in favor of practical assessments. The project targets software engineers, engineering managers, and technical recruiters across web development, mobile, DevOps, data science, and other software domains. Built with JavaScript and integrated with Airtable for data management, it maintains a searchable database of companies that use real-world problem solving, take-home projects, pair programming sessions, and work-sample evaluations instead of algorithmic puzzles. The repository serves as a job-seeking resource for developers who prefer interviews that reflect actual day-to-day engineering work, while helping companies showcase their practical, work-representative hiring methodologies to attract talent frustrated with traditional technical screening processes.
