`hiring-without-whiteboards` is a JavaScript-focused project compiling a curated list of companies and teams that employ alternative, more practical interview processes, specifically avoiding traditional "whiteboard" coding assessments and trivia questions. This project serves as a public resource and directory, featuring companies known for interview practices that resemble day-to-day work, often involving take-home assignments or pairing exercises. It uses JavaScript for its code and documentation, leveraging topics like `airtable, hiring, hiring-without-whiteboards, interview, jobs, tech, whiteboard`. This is a community-driven list with an associated Airtable database for searching and filtering and an API.
