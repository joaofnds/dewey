Rofi is a standalone application, written in C, that serves as a highly configurable window switcher, application launcher, and dmenu replacement for Linux and BSD systems. It offers multiple built-in modes, including window switching, application launching (via desktop files and `$PATH`), an SSH launcher, and a file browser. Key features include type-to-filter functionality (supporting tokenized, fuzzy, and regex matching), UTF-8 support, and advanced theming capabilities. It can also function as a drop-in replacement for dmenu, with added improvements, and is extensible through scripts and plugins. This project targets users of Linux-based window managers seeking enhanced application and window management utilities, and developers looking to customize their desktop environment.
