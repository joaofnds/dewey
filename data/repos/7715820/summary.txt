Rofi is a C-based X11 desktop utility serving as a window switcher, application launcher, and dmenu replacement for Linux window managers, particularly targeting i3 and other tiling WM users. Built with Cairo rendering and Pango font support, it provides keyboard-driven navigation through multiple modes including window switching via EWMH protocol, desktop file application launching, SSH connection management, and file browsing. The tool addresses productivity workflows for power users and system administrators who prefer keyboard-centric interfaces over traditional GUI menus. It features extensible architecture through scripts and plugins, advanced theming capabilities, fuzzy/regex matching, UTF-8 support, and acts as a drop-in dmenu replacement while offering enhanced functionality for Linux desktop environments and window manager ecosystems.
