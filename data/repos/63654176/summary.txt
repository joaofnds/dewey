Bolt-js is a TypeScript-based JavaScript framework specifically designed for building Slack applications and integrations. It provides developers with a structured SDK to handle Slack's Events API, slash commands, interactive components (buttons, modals, shortcuts), and WebSocket connections through Socket Mode. The framework abstracts Slack's complex authentication, request verification, and event handling mechanisms into simple listener patterns for actions, messages, views, and commands. Built on Node.js, it targets web developers and DevOps engineers who need to create custom Slack bots, workflow automations, and enterprise integrations. Bolt-js solves the complexity of Slack's API surface by providing pre-built handlers for webhooks, real-time messaging, and interactive UI components, enabling rapid development of production-ready Slack applications without requiring deep knowledge of Slack's underlying protocols and authentication flows.
