QMK Firmware is an open-source keyboard firmware framework built in C/C++ for Atmel AVR and ARM USB microcontrollers, targeting the custom mechanical keyboard enthusiast and hardware development community. It extends the TMK keyboard firmware foundation to provide advanced programmable functionality for mechanical keyboards, including popular models like Planck, ErgoDox EZ, Clueboard, and hundreds of community-supported keyboards. The firmware enables deep customization of key mappings, macros, layers, and advanced input behaviors through embedded C programming. It solves the problem of limited keyboard programmability by providing a comprehensive development platform for keyboard designers, firmware developers, and enthusiasts who need full control over their input devices' behavior and functionality beyond standard commercial keyboard software.
