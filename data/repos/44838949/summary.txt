The Swift Programming Language repository contains the complete implementation of Swift, a high-performance systems programming language primarily targeting iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS application development. Built with C++ as the implementation language, the codebase includes the Swift compiler, runtime, standard library, and toolchain components that enable memory-safe systems programming with modern syntax. The project supports cross-platform compilation across multiple architectures (x86_64, ARM64, AArch64) and operating systems including Linux distributions, Windows, Android, and WebAssembly targets. Swift serves mobile developers, systems programmers, and application developers who need C/Objective-C interoperability while maintaining memory safety and performance characteristics suitable for both application development and lower-level systems programming tasks within Apple's ecosystem and beyond.
