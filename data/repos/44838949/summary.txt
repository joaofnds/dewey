The `swiftlang/swift` repository hosts the source code for the Swift programming language, a high-performance system programming language designed for general-purpose use. It provides core language features including control flow, data structures, and functions, alongside advanced concepts like objects, protocols, closures, and generics. The project is primarily written in C++ and includes build scripts for various platforms and architectures, including macOS, Linux (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, Debian), and Windows, with support for cross-compilation to WASM and Android. This is a compiler project and toolchain, targeting developers interested in contributing to the Swift language itself or building custom toolchains.
