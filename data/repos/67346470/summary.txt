OneDark-Pro is a Visual Studio Code theme extension that ports Atom's iconic One Dark color scheme to VS Code, targeting web developers and software engineers who prefer dark coding environments. Built with TypeScript and distributed through the VS Code marketplace, it provides multiple theme variants including Flat, Darker, Night Flat, Retro, and Gnome themes with customizable syntax highlighting, italic font support, and integrated terminal styling. The extension addresses developer productivity and eye strain concerns by offering a cohesive dark theme experience across the editor interface, file explorer, and markdown preview. It supports extensive customization through VS Code's `workbench.colorCustomizations` and `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` settings, allowing developers to fine-tune colors and typography for various programming languages and UI components.
