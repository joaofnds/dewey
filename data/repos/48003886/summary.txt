This repository serves as a comprehensive educational resource for Go developers, providing curated implementations and explanations of classic software design patterns adapted for the Go programming language. It covers traditional Gang of Four patterns (creational, structural, behavioral) alongside Go-specific concurrency and synchronization patterns that leverage goroutines, channels, and Go's built-in synchronization primitives. The collection includes practical code examples for patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, Semaphore, Bounded Parallelism, and Generator, with detailed documentation explaining implementation approaches tailored to Go's idioms and conventions. Targeted at intermediate to advanced Go developers working across various domains including web development, distributed systems, and concurrent programming, it addresses the challenge of applying established architectural patterns within Go's unique paradigms of composition over inheritance and communicating sequential processes.
