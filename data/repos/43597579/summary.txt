This Go library provides an HTTP handler implementation for integrating GraphQL servers into Go web applications using the graphql-go framework. Targeting backend web developers building GraphQL APIs, it serves as middleware that processes HTTP requests containing GraphQL queries, variables, and operation names through multiple content types including JSON, form-encoded, and raw GraphQL formats. The handler supports both GET and POST requests, automatically parses GraphQL parameters from query strings or request bodies, and includes optional GraphiQL and Playground web interfaces for development and testing. It solves the common problem of bridging HTTP transport with GraphQL execution engines, enabling developers to quickly expose GraphQL schemas as REST-like endpoints while maintaining GraphQL's query flexibility and type safety in Go-based web services.
