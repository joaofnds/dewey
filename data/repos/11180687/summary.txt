Hugo is a static site generator written in Go that compiles source content into optimized HTML websites for deployment. Targeting web developers, technical writers, and content creators, it transforms Markdown files and templates into production-ready static sites without requiring server-side processing. The framework features advanced templating systems, multilingual support, taxonomy management, and asset pipelines for image processing, JavaScript bundling, Sass compilation, and Tailwind CSS integration. Hugo addresses the need for fast, secure, and scalable websites by pre-generating all pages at build time, eliminating database dependencies and server vulnerabilities while enabling deployment to CDNs and static hosting platforms for optimal performance.
