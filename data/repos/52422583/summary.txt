BackgroundMusic is a macOS audio utility written in C++ and Objective-C that implements low-level Core Audio APIs to provide system-wide audio management capabilities. The application functions as a virtual audio device driver that intercepts and controls audio streams from individual applications, enabling per-application volume control, automatic music player pause/unpause when other audio sources activate, and system audio recording functionality. It integrates with macOS Core Audio framework to act as both an audio input and output device, allowing users to route system audio to recording applications like QuickTime Player. The utility targets macOS power users, audio professionals, and developers who need granular control over application audio streams without requiring system restarts, solving the limitation of macOS's basic system-wide volume controls through direct audio subsystem manipulation.
