Idris2 is a purely functional programming language implementation featuring first-class dependent types, targeting compiler development and language design. Its core functionality centers on enabling expressive and type-safe programming through a sophisticated type system. The project is a standalone language implementation, as indicated by the presence of a compiler and related development infrastructure and targets developers interested in functional programming paradigms, particularly those exploring advanced type systems and language design principles. The codebase is written in Idris.
