This repository provides a pure Elixir implementation of Merkle trees, cryptographic data structures that enable efficient and secure verification of large datasets through hierarchical hashing. Targeting blockchain developers, distributed systems engineers, and cryptography practitioners, the library implements core Merkle tree functionality including tree construction, cryptographic proof generation and verification, and pluggable hash functions (SHA-256, MD5). The implementation features three main modules: MerkleTree for tree construction, MerkleTree.Proof for generating and verifying inclusion proofs, and MerkleTree.Crypto for hash operations. This addresses critical use cases in peer-to-peer networks, blockchain systems, distributed file systems like IPFS, and data integrity verification scenarios where tamper-proof data structures are essential for maintaining trust and consistency across distributed environments.
