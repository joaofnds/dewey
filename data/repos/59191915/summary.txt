This repository provides a pure Elixir implementation of a Merkle Tree data structure. It functions as a library, enabling developers to create and utilize Merkle Trees for data integrity verification, as indicated by its inclusion of modules for proof generation and validation. The project leverages the Elixir programming language and includes functionalities for calculating cryptographic hashes, supporting various hash algorithms. The library is designed to be integrated into Elixir projects, as demonstrated by its dependency management instructions and usage examples within the IEx environment.
