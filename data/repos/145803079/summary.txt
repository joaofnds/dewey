`felixrieseberg/windows95` is a standalone application that emulates the Windows 95 operating system within an Electron framework. Built with TypeScript, it allows users to run a fully functional Windows 95 environment on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The application leverages the v86 emulator to provide the core virtualization functionality, offering a nostalgic recreation of the classic OS. Users can interact with a complete Windows 95 installation, including the ability to run games (some pre-installed) and explore the OS's features.
