This repository implements a Windows 95 emulator as an Electron desktop application, written in TypeScript, that runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Built for retro computing enthusiasts and developers interested in legacy system emulation, it leverages the v86 JavaScript x86 emulator to provide a complete Windows 95 environment within a cross-platform desktop wrapper. The application addresses the use case of running vintage software and games without traditional virtualization overhead, targeting users who want to experience or demonstrate legacy computing environments. It includes disk image management, state persistence, and supports DOS applications, providing a nostalgic computing experience through modern web technologies and Electron's native desktop integration capabilities.
