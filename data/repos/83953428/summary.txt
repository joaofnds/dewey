org-web is a React-Redux web application that provides a browser-based implementation of Emacs org-mode functionality, specifically targeting mobile-optimized task management and note-taking. Built with JavaScript and bootstrapped via Create React App, it enables direct editing of org-mode files through cloud storage synchronization with Dropbox and Google Drive APIs. The application addresses the gap in mobile org-mode accessibility by translating desktop Emacs org-mode features into a responsive web interface, supporting advanced capture templates with URL parameter integration and Siri Shortcuts compatibility. Primarily serves Emacs users and productivity enthusiasts who require cross-platform access to their org-mode workflows, particularly those needing mobile editing capabilities for task management, note-taking, and organizational systems without desktop Emacs dependency.
