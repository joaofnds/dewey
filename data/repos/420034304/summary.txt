TMR is an Emacs Lisp package that implements a timer management system within the Emacs text editor environment. It provides a domain-specific notation for setting timers with convenient syntax parsing, along with comprehensive timer manipulation commands and a tabulated interface for displaying active timers in a grid layout. The package leverages Emacs' built-in timer facilities and extends them with user-friendly abstractions for time specification and timer lifecycle management. Targeted at Emacs power users, developers, and productivity-focused professionals who spend significant time in Emacs, TMR addresses the need for integrated time tracking and reminder functionality without leaving the editor environment. It solves the problem of context switching between Emacs and external timer applications by providing native timer capabilities with Emacs-style keybindings and interfaces.
