This Go library, cenkalti/backoff, provides an implementation of the exponential backoff algorithm. The primary function is to manage retry strategies for processes that may encounter temporary failures, such as network requests or resource limitations. By gradually increasing and then stabilizing the rate of retries, it helps find an acceptable retry interval without overwhelming resources.

The core features include a simple `Retry` function for common use cases, with the option to customize the algorithm for specific needs by copying and modifying the source code. The library follows the exponential backoff pattern, where the time between retries exponentially increases until a threshold is met, at which point it remains constant.

The technology stack consists of Go programming language, making it suitable for use in various systems and web development contexts. This library can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into larger projects to handle retry strategies effectively.

Target users include developers working on applications that require robust handling of temporary failures, such as network requests or resource limitations. By using this library, they can ensure their applications are resilient and can recover gracefully from transient errors.
