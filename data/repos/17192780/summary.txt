This Go library implements the exponential backoff algorithm, a retry mechanism that progressively increases delay intervals between failed operation attempts to avoid overwhelming systems during recovery. Ported from Google's HTTP Client Library for Java, it provides a standardized approach to handling transient failures in distributed systems, network operations, and API integrations. The library targets backend developers, DevOps engineers, and systems programmers working with microservices, cloud applications, and network-dependent services where graceful failure handling is critical. It offers a simple `Retry` function for common use cases while maintaining minimal dependencies and extensibility for custom retry logic, making it particularly valuable for building resilient Go applications that interact with external services, databases, or APIs prone to temporary unavailability.
