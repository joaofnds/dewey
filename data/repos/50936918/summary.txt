wait-for-it is a pure Bash script utility designed for DevOps and containerization workflows that tests TCP host and port availability before proceeding with dependent operations. It addresses service synchronization challenges in container orchestration, particularly Docker multi-container deployments where services must wait for dependencies to become available before starting. The script performs TCP connectivity checks with configurable timeouts and can conditionally execute subsequent commands based on connection success. It targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers working with microservices architectures who need reliable service dependency management without external dependencies. The tool returns appropriate exit codes for script integration and supports both standalone connectivity testing and command chaining for automated deployment pipelines.
