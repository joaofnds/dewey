`wait-for-it` is a standalone, pure Bash script designed to test and wait for the availability of a specified TCP host and port. It facilitates synchronization between interdependent services, particularly useful in containerized environments like Docker, by pausing execution until a target service becomes accessible. Core functionality includes configurable timeouts, a strict mode for conditional subcommand execution, and a quiet mode for reduced output. This utility is a CLI application intended for system administrators and DevOps engineers involved in service orchestration and deployment automation.
