HTMHell is a curated collection of HTML antipatterns and accessibility violations extracted from production websites, serving as an educational resource for web developers to identify and avoid common markup mistakes. Built with Nunjucks templating engine and deployed as a static site, the repository systematically documents real-world HTML bad practices alongside corrective implementations and explanations. The project targets frontend developers, web accessibility specialists, and HTML/CSS practitioners by providing concrete examples of semantic HTML violations, ARIA misuse, and structural markup errors found in modern web applications. Contributors extract problematic code snippets from live websites, anonymize them, and provide detailed remediation guidance, creating a comprehensive reference for improving HTML quality, web accessibility compliance, and semantic markup standards in production environments.
