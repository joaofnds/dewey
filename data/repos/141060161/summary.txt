McFly is a Rust-based shell history enhancement tool that replaces the default `ctrl-r` command history search in Unix shells (Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell). It implements an intelligent search engine powered by a small neural network that prioritizes command suggestions based on contextual factors including current working directory, command execution history, exit status, timestamps, and usage patterns. The tool augments standard shell history with a SQLite database backend to store enhanced metadata while maintaining compatibility with existing shell history files. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and command-line power users, McFly addresses the inefficiency of traditional linear history search by providing contextually relevant command suggestions through real-time machine learning-based ranking, significantly improving terminal workflow productivity.
