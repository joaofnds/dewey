McFly is a command-line application written in Rust that enhances shell history search. It replaces the default `ctrl-r` functionality with an intelligent search engine, prioritizing results based on context, working directory, command frequency, and exit status, utilizing a small neural network for real-time suggestions. Features include a full-screen reverse history search, integration with Zsh, Bash, and PowerShell, and a SQLite database for storing extended history data. This standalone CLI tool targets developers and power users seeking improved shell command recall and navigation.
