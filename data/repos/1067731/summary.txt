The `kirel/detexify-hs-backend` repository provides the backend server for Detexify, a web application that identifies LaTeX symbols from drawn images. Implemented in Haskell, the project is a standalone web application designed to run on port 3000, serving its functionality to a web interface (implied by the existence of a 'homepage' and a backend server). It leverages the Haskell Platform, with dependencies managed using `cabal`, and utilizes a `snapshot.json` file for training data. The project supports Docker containerization and Ansible-based deployment, indicating a focus on production readiness.
