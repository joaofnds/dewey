This repository implements a Haskell-based backend server for Detexify, a LaTeX symbol recognition service. The application serves as a web API that processes handwritten mathematical symbol drawings and matches them against trained data to identify corresponding LaTeX commands. Built using Haskell's web server capabilities, it loads training data from JSON snapshots and exposes recognition functionality through HTTP endpoints on port 3000. The system targets web development and educational technology domains, specifically serving developers and researchers working with mathematical typesetting tools. The backend integrates with containerized deployment using Docker and automated provisioning through Ansible, making it suitable for production environments where LaTeX symbol recognition is needed for mathematical document preparation and online equation editors.
