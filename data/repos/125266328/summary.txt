`black` is an uncompromising Python code formatter, operating within the developer productivity domain. Its core functionality centers on automatically reformatting Python code to adhere to a consistent style, reducing manual formatting effort and eliminating style debates. This standalone command-line tool (CLI) removes formatting control from the user, enforcing a pre-defined, opinionated style based on PEP 8, with limited configuration options. The project is written in Python and is intended for Python developers aiming to improve code readability and maintainability.
