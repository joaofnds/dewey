Hakrawler is a fast web crawler written in Go that specializes in endpoint and asset discovery for web application security testing. Built on the Gocolly framework, it systematically crawls websites to extract URLs, JavaScript file locations, and other web assets through parsing HTML forms, links, and scripts. The tool targets cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters conducting reconnaissance and OSINT operations. It supports concurrent crawling with configurable depth limits, proxy integration for intercepting traffic through tools like Burp Suite, subdomain inclusion, custom headers, and JSON output formatting. Hakrawler addresses the critical reconnaissance phase of security assessments by automating the discovery of attack surfaces and hidden endpoints that might otherwise be missed during manual testing, making it an essential component in offensive security toolchains.
