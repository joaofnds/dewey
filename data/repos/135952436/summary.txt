A/B Street is a comprehensive traffic simulation and urban planning software suite built in Rust that enables transportation professionals, urban planners, and civic advocates to model and analyze street-level traffic patterns in real cities. The system ingests OpenStreetMap data to generate detailed transportation networks, implements discrete-event traffic simulation algorithms, and provides interactive tools for editing street configurations, planning bike infrastructure, and designing low-traffic neighborhoods. Core applications include traffic flow simulation, bike network gap analysis, intersection geometry optimization, and 15-minute neighborhood accessibility modeling. The platform targets urban planners, transportation engineers, and civic advocacy groups who need accessible, data-driven tools for evidence-based transportation policy decisions, offering both web-based and desktop interfaces for collaborative urban planning analysis.
