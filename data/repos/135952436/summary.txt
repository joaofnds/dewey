A/B Street is a transportation planning and traffic simulation software application, built in Rust, designed to model and simulate urban environments for the purpose of making cities more friendly to walking, biking, and public transit. It leverages OpenStreetMap data to simulate traffic flow, allows users to edit street layouts and intersections, and facilitates the planning of bike networks and low-traffic neighborhoods. This standalone application includes features for traffic simulation, scenario planning, and educational games centered around 15-minute neighborhoods.
