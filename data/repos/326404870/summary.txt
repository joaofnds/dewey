SigNoz is an open-source observability platform built with TypeScript/React for the frontend and Go for the backend, targeting DevOps engineers and site reliability engineers. It provides unified application performance monitoring (APM) by collecting and visualizing logs, metrics, and distributed traces through OpenTelemetry instrumentation. The platform uses ClickHouse as its columnar datastore for efficient log analytics and time-series data storage, offering features like custom dashboards, alerting, exception monitoring, and query builders with PromQL support. It serves as a self-hosted alternative to commercial APM solutions like DataDog and New Relic, helping teams troubleshoot microservices applications, monitor infrastructure performance, and correlate telemetry data across the observability stack for faster incident resolution.
