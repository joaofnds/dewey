kuard is a demonstration application specifically designed for the "Kubernetes Up and Running" book, serving as a comprehensive educational tool for learning Kubernetes deployment patterns and container orchestration concepts. Built with Go backend and React frontend, it provides hands-on examples of containerized application development, multi-stage Docker builds, and Kubernetes resource management. The application includes practical features like a synthetic RSA key generation workload for simulating batch processing, an in-memory REST queue system (MemQ) for demonstrating distributed computing patterns, and multiple versioned container images (blue/green/purple) to illustrate deployment strategies and rolling updates. Targeting DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and developers learning Kubernetes, kuard addresses the need for realistic demo applications that showcase container lifecycle management, workload simulation, and cloud-native architecture principles in educational and training environments.
