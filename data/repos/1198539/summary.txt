Netron is a cross-platform neural network model visualization tool built in JavaScript that enables machine learning practitioners to inspect and understand deep learning model architectures. It supports comprehensive model format parsing including ONNX, TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch, Keras, Core ML, Caffe, Darknet, TensorFlow.js, and Safetensors, with experimental support for TorchScript, OpenVINO, and other ML frameworks. The tool provides both desktop applications (Electron-based) for macOS, Windows, and Linux, as well as a web-based viewer, allowing data scientists and ML engineers to visualize computational graphs, layer structures, and model parameters without requiring framework-specific environments. Netron addresses the critical need for model interpretability and debugging in machine learning workflows by offering a unified interface to examine diverse model formats across different deep learning ecosystems.
