`wal` is a Go library providing a simple and fast write-ahead log (WAL) implementation. It enables durable and efficient logging operations, including features like monotonic indexing, batch writes, and log truncation from both front and back. Designed for use in Go applications needing reliable data persistence, it allows developers to write and read log entries with a focus on performance, suitable for applications requiring data durability and sequential write/read patterns. This project is a library providing core functionality for building data persistence layers or enhancing existing systems.
