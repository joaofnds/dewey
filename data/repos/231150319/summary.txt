tidwall/wal is a Go library implementing a write-ahead log (WAL) data structure for persistent, ordered data storage with crash recovery capabilities. Targeting backend developers and database engineers building distributed systems, storage engines, or transactional applications, it provides monotonic indexing, batch write operations, and log truncation functionality for maintaining data durability and consistency. The library addresses the fundamental problem of ensuring data persistence and recoverability in systems that require atomic operations and crash safety, commonly used in database implementations, message queues, and state machines where ordered, durable writes are critical for maintaining system integrity during failures or restarts.
