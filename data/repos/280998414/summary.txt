The `apple_cursor` repository provides open-source macOS cursor themes for Windows and Linux, offering a customizable alternative to system defaults. It primarily functions as a theming project, enabling users to download and install cursor sets. Functionality includes support for HiDPI displays, various cursor sizes, and color customization options through command-line tools (`cbmp` for color manipulation and `ctgen` for theme generation). Built using Shell scripts and depending on Python (version 3.7 or higher) and tools like `clickgen` and `yarn`, it offers installation instructions for multiple operating systems, including Arch Linux/Manjaro and openSUSE Tumbleweed.
