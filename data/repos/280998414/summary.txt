This repository provides free and open-source macOS cursor themes for cross-platform desktop customization, targeting Linux (X11/Xcursor) and Windows systems. Built using Shell scripts and Python with the clickgen library, it converts SVG cursor designs into platform-specific formats including Windows .cur/.ani files and Linux Xcursor themes. The project addresses desktop personalization needs by enabling non-macOS users to replicate Apple's cursor aesthetics with HiDPI support across multiple sizes (16-96px for Linux, 32-256px for Windows). The build system uses TOML configuration files to generate cursor packages for different platforms and size variants, serving desktop customization enthusiasts, theme developers, and system administrators who want consistent macOS-style cursor experiences across heterogeneous computing environments.
