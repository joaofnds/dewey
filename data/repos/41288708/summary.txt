Sourcegraph is a code intelligence and search platform built primarily in Go that provides comprehensive code analysis, navigation, and search capabilities across large-scale codebases and multiple repositories. The platform targets software engineering teams and organizations in the enterprise development domain, offering advanced code search functionality across all branches and code hosts, intelligent code navigation with reference finding and ownership tracking, and large-scale refactoring tools for managing code migrations. The system implements a distributed architecture supporting both cloud-hosted and self-hosted deployments, integrating with existing development workflows through GraphQL APIs and web interfaces. It addresses the critical problem of code discoverability and maintainability in complex, multi-repository software ecosystems where traditional IDE-based search and navigation tools become inadequate for enterprise-scale codebases.
