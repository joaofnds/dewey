Termshark is a terminal-based network packet analysis tool that provides a Wireshark-inspired TUI (Terminal User Interface) for tshark, targeting network administrators, security professionals, and DevOps engineers working with network debugging and packet capture analysis. Built in Go using the tcell terminal framework and gowid UI widgets, it enables remote packet inspection without GUI dependencies, solving the common problem of analyzing pcap files or performing live network captures on headless servers. The tool supports Wireshark display filters, TCP/UDP flow reassembly, protocol-based network conversations, and real-time interface sniffing, making it particularly valuable for infrastructure troubleshooting, security analysis, and network forensics in command-line environments where traditional GUI-based tools are impractical.
