`termshark` is a standalone, terminal-based user interface for analyzing network traffic, mirroring functionality of Wireshark. Built in Go, it enables users to read pcap files or perform live packet captures using tshark, Wireshark's command-line analyzer. Core features include filtering with Wireshark's display filters, TCP/UDP flow reassembly and inspection, and protocol-based conversation views. This CLI application depends on the tcell and gowid libraries for terminal UI rendering and widget composition, targeting network engineers and security professionals needing a lightweight, terminal-based packet analysis tool.
