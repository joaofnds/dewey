**up** (Ultimate Plumber) is a terminal-based interactive pipeline builder for Linux text processing, implemented in Go with a TUI (Terminal User Interface). It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and command-line power users who need to construct complex bash pipelines using standard Unix utilities like grep, awk, cut, sort, and sed. The tool provides real-time preview of pipeline output as users incrementally build commands, addressing the slow feedback loop problem in traditional shell pipeline development. Users pipe data into **up**, then interactively construct and test bash pipelines with live output preview, scrollable results navigation, and the ability to save working pipelines to shell scripts, significantly accelerating the iterative process of building complex text-processing workflows on Linux systems.
