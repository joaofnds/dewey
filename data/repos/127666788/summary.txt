`up` is a standalone, terminal-based application written in Go that facilitates interactive creation and exploration of Linux pipelines. Its core function is to provide a live, scrollable preview of command results within a TUI, enabling rapid iteration and debugging of text-processing pipelines using utilities like `grep`, `sort`, and `awk`. The application leverages a `bash -c` command execution and offers features like input buffering and saving pipelines to files. It is targeted toward Linux users and system administrators who need to efficiently manipulate and understand textual data through command-line operations.
