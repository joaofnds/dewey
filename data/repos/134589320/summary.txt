This repository serves as a comprehensive educational resource for Go developers learning to implement and manage Go modules, the dependency management system introduced in Go 1.11+. The project contains work-along guides covering essential Go modules concepts including submodules, vendor management, semantic import versioning, cyclic dependencies, tooling integration, and migration strategies from legacy dependency managers like `dep`. Written primarily in Shell scripts for automation and demonstration purposes, the guides address practical challenges in Go software development such as dependency resolution, version management, API compatibility checking with tools like `apidiff`, and repository structuring strategies for multi-version projects. The resource targets Go developers, DevOps engineers, and software architects working in backend development, microservices, and distributed systems who need to master Go's module system for production applications.
