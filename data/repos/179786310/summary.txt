CSSFX is a Vue.js-based web application that serves as a curated library of CSS animation effects for web developers. The platform provides a click-to-copy interface where developers can browse, preview, and instantly copy CSS code snippets for various visual effects including animations and SVG-based interactions. Built primarily for front-end developers and UI/UX designers working on web projects, it addresses the common need for readily-available, production-ready CSS animations without requiring developers to write effects from scratch. The repository functions as both a showcase and distribution platform for reusable CSS animation code, streamlining the workflow for incorporating visual effects into web applications and reducing development time for common animation requirements.
