Emacs Prelude is a pre-configured Emacs distribution built with Emacs Lisp that provides an enhanced development environment for software engineers and Emacs users. It targets the general software development domain by bundling curated third-party packages, programming language modes, and improved default configurations for GNU Emacs 25.1+. The distribution features a modular architecture with opt-in language modules, automatic package management, and sane defaults while maintaining compatibility with traditional Emacs workflows. It solves the configuration complexity problem that newcomers face when setting up Emacs for modern development work, providing a foundation that experienced developers can extend. The system serves as a middle-ground alternative to more opinionated distributions like Spacemacs, offering enhanced functionality without drastically altering the core Emacs experience for developers across multiple programming languages and platforms.
