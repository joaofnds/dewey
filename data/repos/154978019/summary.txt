IP Geolocation API is a high-performance web service built for developers needing real-time visitor location data based on IP addresses. The service leverages CloudFlare's IP Geolocation infrastructure and enhances it with additional country-specific metadata. Built on Python's Starlette framework with Uvicorn ASGI server, uvloop for async performance, and ultraJSON for fast serialization, it delivers thousands of concurrent requests per second with minimal resource overhead. Targeting web developers and application architects in the web development domain, it solves the common need for geographic user segmentation, content localization, and analytics tracking. The lightweight architecture makes it suitable for microservices deployments and API gateway integration scenarios.
