The `apilayer/geolocationapi` repository provides a free IP geolocation API service. It utilizes Cloudflare's IP Geolocation data, enhancing it with country-specific information. Built on Starlette, Uvicorn, and uvloop for asynchronous request handling and high throughput, the project aims to serve geo-coding requests with low system requirements. This is a standalone, web-based API primarily targeting developers who need to determine visitor geolocation data within their applications.
