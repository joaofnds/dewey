vim-peekaboo is a Vim editor plugin written in Vim script that enhances register visibility and management for text editing workflows. It extends Vim's native register access commands (`"`, `@` in normal mode and `<CTRL-R>` in insert mode) by displaying a real-time sidebar preview of all register contents, eliminating the guesswork when selecting stored text snippets or macros. The plugin targets software developers, system administrators, and power users who rely on Vim for code editing and text manipulation tasks. It addresses the common problem of register content opacity in Vim, where users must memorize or guess what text is stored in specific registers. The tool provides customizable window positioning, display modes, delay settings, and key mapping prefixes, automatically closing the preview sidebar after selection to maintain editing flow efficiency.
