The `google/btree` repository provides an in-memory B-Tree implementation for the Go programming language. It functions as an ordered, mutable data structure, offering functionality similar to `github.com/petar/GoLLRB/llrb` trees, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of ordered data. This project is a Go library designed to be integrated within other Go programs requiring an in-memory, ordered data structure solution. The API and functionality are directly comparable to GoLLRB trees, facilitating its use as a drop-in replacement.
