This Go package implements an in-memory B-Tree data structure providing ordered, mutable storage for Go applications. Designed as a drop-in replacement for LLRB (Left-Leaning Red-Black) trees, it offers efficient insertion, deletion, and range query operations with guaranteed logarithmic time complexity. The library targets backend developers and systems programmers who need performant ordered collections for applications like databases, caching systems, indexing services, and algorithmic computing where sorted data access patterns are critical. Built specifically for the Go ecosystem, it serves domains including distributed systems, database internals, search engines, and high-performance computing applications where memory-efficient ordered data structures are essential for maintaining sorted datasets without external dependencies.
