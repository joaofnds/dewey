AssertJ is a Java library providing fluent and strongly-typed assertions for unit testing. Its core purpose is to simplify and enhance the writing of tests by offering type-specific assertions for common data structures and types like strings, collections, and maps, improving test readability and reducing boilerplate. The library features modules for various technologies including Guava, Joda Time, Neo4J, DB, and Swing, extending its assertion capabilities across multiple domains. This is a developer productivity tool, specifically a library, designed for Java developers using testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG to write more expressive and maintainable tests.
