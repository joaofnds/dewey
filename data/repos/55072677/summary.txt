Weaviate is an open-source vector database implemented in Go that provides cloud-native storage and retrieval for high-dimensional vectors alongside structured data. It implements HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search, enabling millisecond-latency similarity searches across millions of objects. The system targets AI/ML engineers, data scientists, and software developers building semantic search engines, recommendation systems, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications. It integrates with major ML platforms including OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, and custom models through a modular architecture, supporting both automated vectorization at ingestion and pre-computed vector uploads. The database offers production features including horizontal scaling, replication, CRUD operations via GraphQL/gRPC APIs, and Kubernetes deployment capabilities for MLOps workflows requiring persistent vector storage with traditional database reliability.
