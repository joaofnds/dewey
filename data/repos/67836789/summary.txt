Tokio is an asynchronous runtime library for Rust that provides the foundational infrastructure for building concurrent, non-blocking I/O applications. It implements an event-driven architecture with a multithreaded work-stealing task scheduler, OS-backed reactor using epoll/kqueue/IOCP, and async TCP/UDP networking primitives. The runtime enables Rust developers to write scalable network services, web servers, and distributed systems by abstracting away low-level concurrency management and system event handling. Tokio serves as the core runtime for the broader Rust async ecosystem, supporting frameworks like Axum, Hyper, and Tonic for web development, HTTP services, and gRPC implementations. It targets backend developers and systems programmers building high-performance network applications who need reliable async/await functionality with zero-cost abstractions and memory safety guarantees.
