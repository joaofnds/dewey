Tokio is a Rust-based runtime designed for building reliable and efficient asynchronous applications, particularly in the networking domain. It provides core components including a multithreaded task scheduler, an event-driven reactor utilizing OS-specific event queues, and asynchronous TCP/UDP socket implementations. The library enables developers to create high-performance, non-blocking I/O applications, offering features for concurrent processing and efficient resource management, with a focus on scalability and thread safety. Tokio functions as a fundamental building block, a library, for applications requiring asynchronous I/O in Rust.
