The prometheus-community/helm-charts repository provides officially maintained Helm charts for deploying Prometheus monitoring infrastructure on Kubernetes clusters. Targeting the DevOps and infrastructure monitoring domain, this collection enables system administrators and platform engineers to easily install and configure Prometheus-based observability stacks including Prometheus server, Alertmanager, Grafana, and related monitoring components. Built using Helm templating (Mustache syntax) and Kubernetes manifests, these charts solve the complexity of manually deploying and managing distributed monitoring systems by providing parameterized, production-ready configurations. The repository serves as the canonical source for Prometheus community charts, offering standardized deployment patterns for metrics collection, alerting, and visualization workflows in cloud-native environments.
