The `prometheus-community/helm-charts` repository provides a collection of Helm charts for deploying and managing Prometheus-related components within Kubernetes clusters. It enables users to install and configure Prometheus monitoring solutions through Helm, simplifying deployment and lifecycle management. The project leverages Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, and is primarily built using Mustache templating language for chart definitions. This is a community-maintained repository intended for system administrators and DevOps engineers deploying and managing Prometheus in Kubernetes environments.
