**Requests** is a Python HTTP client library that simplifies making HTTP/1.1 requests for web development, API integration, and data retrieval tasks. Built for Python developers working with REST APIs, web scraping, and HTTP-based services, it abstracts complex urllib functionality into an intuitive interface supporting authentication, session management, SSL/TLS verification, connection pooling, and automatic JSON parsing. The library handles common HTTP operations like GET/POST requests, cookie persistence, proxy support, file uploads, and response processing without requiring manual URL encoding or low-level socket programming. Primarily used by Python developers, data scientists, and DevOps engineers for API consumption, web automation, and HTTP-based integrations, Requests serves as the de facto standard HTTP client in the Python ecosystem with over 30 million weekly downloads.
