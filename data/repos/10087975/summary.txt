Hoplon is a ClojureScript library for building single-page web applications through reactive DOM manipulation and composable UI elements. Targeting web developers working in the Clojure ecosystem, it integrates tightly with Javelin cells to create reactive data bindings between application state and DOM elements. The library abstracts web platform inconsistencies and provides a functional programming approach to frontend development, allowing developers to build interactive web UIs using Clojure's immutable data structures and reactive programming paradigms. Hoplon addresses the complexity of managing DOM state and event handling in SPAs by leveraging ClojureScript's functional programming model, offering an alternative to JavaScript-based frameworks like React or Vue for developers preferring Lisp-based languages and reactive programming patterns.
