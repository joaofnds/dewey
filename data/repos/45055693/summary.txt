Etcher is a cross-platform, standalone application designed for safely and easily flashing OS images to SD cards and USB drives. Built using web technologies (implicitly suggesting Electron), it provides features like protection against writing to hard drives and data integrity verification. The application supports multiple operating systems including Linux, Windows, and macOS, and offers installers for various package managers (Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, Arch/Manjaro, WinGet, and Chocolatey). This project is a GUI-based utility targeting end-users requiring an easy method for creating bootable media from OS image files.
