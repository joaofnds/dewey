Rack::Timeout is a Ruby middleware library for web applications that automatically aborts HTTP requests exceeding configurable time limits by raising exceptions. Designed for Rails and Rack-based web applications, it serves as a debugging and remediation tool to prevent long-running requests from consuming server resources indefinitely. The library integrates into the Rack middleware stack with a default 15-second timeout and provides multiple configurable parameters including service timeout, wait timeout, and wait overtime settings. Targeted at Ruby web developers and DevOps engineers, it addresses request lifecycle management issues in production web applications by forcing timeout enforcement, enabling developers to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize application response times rather than allowing requests to hang indefinitely.
