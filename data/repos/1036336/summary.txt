`rack-timeout` is a Ruby library designed to abort long-running requests in Rack-based applications. It provides middleware that raises an exception when a request exceeds a configurable timeout, with a default of 15 seconds, and supports customization via environment variables. The library is compatible with Ruby 2.3+ and Rails 3.x+, integrating into Rails, Sinatra, and other Rack frameworks. This library is a Ruby-based middleware for improving the robustness of web applications by preventing resource exhaustion due to slow requests, and is primarily intended for Ruby on Rails and Rack developers.
