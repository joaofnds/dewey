`kcctl` is a Java-based command-line interface (CLI) designed for interacting with Apache Kafka Connect clusters. It provides functionalities to manage connectors, including registration, examination, deletion, restart, and modification of connector configurations and offsets, mirroring `kubectl`-like semantics for Kafka Connect. Built using the Quarkus framework, it supports features such as configuration context management, basic authentication, and native executable generation via GraalVM, targeting developers and operators for improved Kafka Connect cluster management. The project is a standalone CLI application.
