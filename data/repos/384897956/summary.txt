kcctl is a command-line interface tool for managing Apache Kafka Connect clusters, targeting DevOps engineers and data platform administrators working with event streaming infrastructure. Built with Java and Quarkus framework, it provides kubectl-inspired commands for registering, monitoring, restarting, and deleting Kafka Connect connectors through REST API interactions. The tool supports authentication, configuration contexts for multiple environments, and offers native binary compilation via GraalVM for cross-platform deployment. It addresses the operational complexity of managing Kafka Connect deployments by providing intuitive CLI commands for connector lifecycle management, offset manipulation, and cluster inspection, replacing the need for manual REST API calls or web UI interactions in data pipeline operations.
