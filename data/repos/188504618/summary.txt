Userbase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform for web developers building static websites and single-page applications. It provides a JavaScript SDK that enables client-side user authentication, data persistence, and database operations without requiring traditional backend infrastructure. The system implements end-to-end encryption with user-controlled keys, performing database queries directly in the browser rather than on servers. Built on AWS infrastructure with automatic resource provisioning, Userbase targets frontend developers who want to add user accounts and data storage to static HTML/CSS/JavaScript applications while maintaining privacy and GDPR compliance. The open-source solution eliminates the need for backend development, server management, and database administration in modern web application development.
