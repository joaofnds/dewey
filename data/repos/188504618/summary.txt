Userbase is a JavaScript-based backend-as-a-service solution enabling secure and private web applications using only static JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It provides built-in user accounts, a zero-management client-side database, and end-to-end encryption to facilitate secure user data storage. The SDK allows developers to integrate user authentication and data persistence directly into frontend web applications without requiring server-side code. The project is an open-source SDK targeting frontend developers building static websites or single-page applications.
