Lux is a command-line video downloader and Go library designed for programmatically extracting and downloading video content from major streaming platforms including YouTube, Bilibili, iQiyi, Youku, Tumblr, and QQ Video. Built entirely in Go, it functions as both a standalone CLI tool and an embeddable library for web scraping applications. The tool implements site-specific extractors to parse video metadata, supports multi-threaded downloads with resume capability, handles cookies and proxy configurations, and integrates with FFmpeg for media file processing. It addresses the need for automated video content acquisition in media archival, content migration, and offline viewing scenarios. The software targets developers, system administrators, and content creators who require reliable, scriptable video downloading capabilities across multiple Chinese and international video platforms without browser dependencies.
