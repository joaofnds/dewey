**tick** is a Clojure/ClojureScript time manipulation library that provides a functional API wrapper around Java 8's `java.time` (JVM) and `js-joda` (JavaScript) for cross-platform temporal operations. Designed as a replacement for `clj-time`, it targets Clojure developers building applications requiring date-time arithmetic, calendar operations, interval calculations, and timezone handling across JVM and browser environments. The library implements immutable time values following functional programming principles, offering a more ergonomic API than raw Java interop while maintaining compatibility with babashka. It addresses the complexity of temporal data manipulation in full-stack Clojure applications, particularly for developers working with scheduling systems, data processing pipelines, financial applications, or any domain requiring precise time calculations and cross-platform date handling consistency.
