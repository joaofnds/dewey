Bling is a cross-platform text formatting library for Clojure ecosystem applications that provides rich console output styling capabilities across Clojure, ClojureScript, and Babashka environments. The library enables developers to create styled terminal and browser console output using a hiccup-like markup syntax, supporting text decorations (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough), foreground/background colors, and pre-built templates for error handling and callout blocks. Targeting Clojure developers working on CLI tools, development utilities, logging systems, and debugging applications, Bling addresses the need for accessible, visually structured console output that maintains readability across both light and dark terminal themes. The library features an 11-color accessibility-focused palette designed for optimal contrast ratios and provides specialized functions for common use cases like error reporting and highlighted messages in development workflows.
