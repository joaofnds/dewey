`Spellbook of Modern Web Dev` is a comprehensive compilation of resources for modern JavaScript web development, serving as a curated "knowledge graph" or "skill tree" rather than a simple list. It provides links to APIs, libraries, tools, services, and best practices, covering core web technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and Node.js, along with related tooling and frameworks, including React. The project aims to assist web developers in navigating the rapidly evolving JavaScript ecosystem by focusing on the most frequently encountered problems and commonly used solutions, prioritizing practical application and trend analysis over exhaustive documentation. This is a curated resource intended for frontend developers aiming to learn and stay current with modern web development.
