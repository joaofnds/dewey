The "Spellbook of Modern Web Dev" is a comprehensive knowledge base and taxonomy for JavaScript-based web development, serving as a curated reference guide for full-stack web developers. It provides a hierarchical classification of 2000+ resources covering the modern web development ecosystem, including HTML5/Web APIs, CSS3 features, ES6+ JavaScript, Node.js, WebAssembly, build tools, frameworks (React, Vue, Angular), testing libraries, and deployment platforms. The repository functions as a structured learning path and decision-making aid, helping developers navigate JavaScript fatigue by identifying the most commonly used, non-outdated tools and libraries based on npm download statistics and empirical usage data. It targets both new and experienced web developers seeking to understand the current landscape of JavaScript web application development technologies and best practices.
