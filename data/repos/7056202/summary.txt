{fmt} is a high-performance C++ formatting library that provides a modern, type-safe alternative to C stdio printf and C++ iostreams for string formatting operations. Targeting C++ developers across systems programming, application development, and performance-critical domains, it implements C++20 std::format and C++23 std::print standards with Python-like format string syntax. The library features fast IEEE 754 floating-point formatting using the Dragonbox algorithm, Unicode support, compile-time format string validation, and extensible formatting for user-defined types. It addresses performance bottlenecks and safety issues in traditional C/C++ string formatting while maintaining cross-platform compatibility and offering both header-only and compiled library configurations for integration into existing C++ codebases.
