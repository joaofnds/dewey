`fmtlib/fmt` is a high-performance, cross-platform C++ library providing a modern alternative to `stdio` and iostreams for formatted output and string manipulation. It implements `std::format` and `std::print`, offering a format string syntax similar to Python's, along with fast IEEE 754 floating-point formatting using the Dragonbox algorithm, Unicode support, and a safe `printf` implementation. This library delivers high performance, is extensible for user-defined types, and features compile-time safety checks, making it a key tool for C++ developers seeking improved formatting capabilities and performance in their projects. It is offered as a header-only or standard library.
