RedisTimeSeries is a C-based Redis module providing a time series data structure for storing and querying time-based data. It enables high-volume inserts and low-latency reads of time series samples, offering features such as aggregated queries (min, max, avg, sum), configurable retention periods, and data compaction. The module supports time series metadata (labels) for querying and integrates with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Telegraf, making it suitable for monitoring, sensor data, and other time-sensitive applications. This is a Redis module, a plugin extending the functionality of the Redis key-value store.
