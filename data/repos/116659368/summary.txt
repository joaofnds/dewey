RedisTimeSeries is a C-based Redis module that implements a specialized time series data structure for high-performance temporal data storage and analysis. Targeting DevOps, monitoring, and IoT domains, it enables storage of timestamped key-value pairs with configurable retention policies, data compaction, and real-time aggregation functions (min, max, avg, sum, etc.). The module supports out-of-order ingestion, duplicate handling policies, and label-based querying for cross-series operations. It integrates with monitoring ecosystems through adapters for Prometheus, Grafana, Telegraf, and StatsD, solving the problem of efficient time series data management for metrics collection, sensor data analysis, and financial market data processing. System administrators and backend developers use it to build scalable monitoring and analytics systems requiring low-latency reads and high-volume inserts.
