Grafana Pyroscope is a continuous profiling platform built in Go that enables real-time performance monitoring and optimization for production applications. Targeting DevOps engineers, SRE teams, and backend developers, it collects and analyzes CPU, memory, and I/O performance data through language-specific SDKs (Go, Python, Ruby, etc.) and Grafana Alloy agents. The system comprises a Go-based server for data storage/processing, client SDKs for data collection, and the Explore Profiles UI for visualization within Grafana dashboards. It addresses performance bottleneck identification, resource optimization, and incident debugging by providing line-level code insights through flame graphs and profiling data, enabling both proactive performance tuning and reactive troubleshooting in distributed systems and microservices architectures.
