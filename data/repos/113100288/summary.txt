`ulid/spec` defines the specification for Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers (ULIDs), offering a 128-bit, sortable, and URL-safe alternative to UUIDs. This specification details the structure of ULIDs, which combine a 48-bit timestamp and 80 bits of random data, encoded as a 26-character case-insensitive string using Crockford's base32.  It includes details for the canonical string representation, monotonicity considerations within the same millisecond, and the binary layout.  This is a specification document with a focus on a unique identifier scheme, aimed at developers needing efficient and sortable identifiers, with implementations in many programming languages.
