This repository contains the canonical specification for ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier), a UUID alternative designed for distributed systems and database applications. ULID addresses UUID limitations by providing 128-bit identifiers that are lexicographically sortable, more character-efficient (26 vs 36 characters), and use Crockford's Base32 encoding for better readability and URL safety. The specification defines a 48-bit timestamp component and 80-bit randomness component with monotonic ordering guarantees within milliseconds, targeting backend developers and database engineers working on distributed systems, microservices, and applications requiring sortable unique identifiers. The spec includes binary layout definitions, encoding rules, and overflow handling, with implementations available across 30+ programming languages for cross-platform adoption in web development and system architecture.
