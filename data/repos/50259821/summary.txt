Nerves is a framework and set of tools for crafting and deploying embedded software using Elixir and the Erlang virtual machine. It enables the creation of small, self-contained firmware images for microprocessor-based systems, leveraging the BEAM's robustness and the Elixir programming experience. Core functionalities include hardware access, network configuration, and integration with the Elixir ecosystem, including Phoenix, LiveView, and Nx. This project provides the core tooling, documentation, and a new project generator, and is a foundational element within a larger ecosystem of related libraries and system configurations for specific hardware targets, which also includes supporting cross-compilation toolchains. The project is a framework and platform focused on embedded systems development.
