Nerves is an embedded systems development framework that enables developers to build and deploy firmware for microprocessor-based devices using Elixir and the Erlang Virtual Machine. It targets the embedded systems and IoT domain by providing a Linux kernel-based runtime that bypasses traditional Linux distributions, instead launching the Erlang runtime directly as a core OS process. The framework leverages Buildroot for system image creation, includes hardware abstraction libraries, networking configuration tools, and integrates with the broader Elixir ecosystem including Phoenix, LiveView, and Scenic for embedded user interfaces. Nerves solves the complexity of embedded Linux development by providing a high-level, fault-tolerant programming environment while maintaining small, self-contained firmware images, primarily serving embedded systems developers who want to use functional programming paradigms for IoT and embedded applications.
