`inline-anki` is an Emacs Lisp package enabling the creation of Spaced Repetition System (SRS) flashcards directly within flowing text, acting as a developer productivity tool. It allows embedding cloze deletion flashcards using various formatting approaches like running paragraphs, list items with IDs, and multi-line blocks, leveraging Emacs Org mode syntax with underlines marking cloze deletions and note IDs. The package utilizes AnkiConnect bindings, potentially facilitating integration with Anki, and is designed for Emacs users seeking a single-source-of-truth approach to flashcard-based learning. This project is an Emacs package or plugin.
