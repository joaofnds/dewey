inline-anki is an Emacs Lisp package that enables spaced repetition learning by embedding Anki flashcards directly within flowing text documents, targeting Emacs users who want to integrate SRS (Spaced Repetition Software) study materials into their note-taking workflow. Unlike existing Emacs SRS tools (org-fc, org-drill, org-anki, pamparam, anki-editor) that isolate flashcards under dedicated headlines, this package allows cloze deletion flashcards to be embedded inline within paragraphs, list items, or multiline blocks using simple markup syntax with unique numerical identifiers. The system supports four embedding methods: trailing superscript IDs in paragraphs, leading @ symbols with IDs in list items, trailing IDs in mixed lists, and dedicated `#+begin_flashcard` blocks for multiline content. This approach maintains a single-source-of-truth principle where educational content flows naturally within documentation, research notes, or any Org-mode text while automatically generating Anki cards for spaced repetition study.
