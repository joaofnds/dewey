RDoc is Ruby's official documentation generation system that parses Ruby source code and comments to produce HTML documentation and command-line reference materials. Built for Ruby developers and library maintainers, it automatically extracts API documentation from Ruby (.rb), C extension (.c), and markup files, supporting multiple comment formats including RDoc::Markup, Markdown, and TomDoc. The tool provides both programmatic APIs and command-line utilities (rdoc, ri) for generating comprehensive documentation websites with customizable themes, cross-references, and coverage reporting. RDoc integrates with Ruby's ecosystem through Rake tasks and gem workflows, solving the critical need for standardized, navigable API documentation that enhances code maintainability and developer experience across Ruby projects and open-source libraries.
