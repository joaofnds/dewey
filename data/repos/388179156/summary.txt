diaglist.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides live-updating LSP (Language Server Protocol) diagnostics integration with Neovim's quickfix and loclist windows. Targeting software developers using Neovim as their primary editor, it automatically populates the quickfix window with workspace-wide diagnostics from all buffers while prioritizing current buffer errors, and displays current buffer diagnostics in the loclist. The plugin hooks into LSP diagnostic events (`LspDiagnosticsChanged`, `WinEnter`, `BufEnter`) to provide real-time updates with configurable debouncing, solving the problem of efficiently viewing and navigating code errors, warnings, and hints across entire projects without manual refresh. It's designed for developers working in LSP-supported languages who need streamlined error management and code navigation within the Neovim ecosystem.
