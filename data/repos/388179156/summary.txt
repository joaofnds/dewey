`diaglist.nvim` is a Neovim plugin providing live, real-time rendering of Language Server Protocol (LSP) diagnostics within the quickfix and loclist windows. This Lua-based plugin prioritizes displaying current buffer errors at the top of the quickfix window while presenting all workspace diagnostics. Key features include live updates for diagnostics, debouncing, and the ability to filter quickfix diagnostics to only show those from the current buffer's clients. It facilitates improved developer workflow within the Neovim text editor by enhancing error visibility and navigation.
