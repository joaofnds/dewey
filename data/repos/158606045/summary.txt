Zero is a file-system based web framework for Node.js that eliminates configuration overhead in full-stack web development. It automatically handles routing, bundling, transpilation, and dependency resolution for multi-language applications supporting JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, Svelte, Python, HTML, and MDX within a single project structure. The framework implements convention-over-configuration principles with automatic server-side rendering (SSR), hot module replacement (HMR), and zero-config deployment where file paths directly map to HTTP endpoints. Zero targets full-stack web developers seeking rapid prototyping and development without webpack configuration, package management, or build tool setup, particularly useful for creating mixed-technology web applications that combine frontend frameworks with backend APIs and static content in unified project architectures.
