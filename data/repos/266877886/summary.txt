Rsync is a command-line file synchronization utility implemented in C that provides fast incremental file transfer using a delta-transfer algorithm. It calculates and transmits only the differences between source and destination files, eliminating the need to transfer entire files during updates. The tool operates in multiple modes including direct file copying, remote synchronization over SSH/RSH protocols, and daemon mode for server-based file distribution. Primarily targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and IT professionals, rsync serves critical functions in backup operations, server mirroring, software deployment, and data replication workflows. Its delta-sync algorithm and network efficiency make it essential infrastructure tooling for managing file consistency across distributed systems, particularly in Unix/Linux environments where automated backup and synchronization processes are required.
