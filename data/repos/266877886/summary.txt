Rsync is a fast, versatile file copying tool designed for both remote and local file transfer, utilizing a delta-transfer algorithm to efficiently synchronize files by transmitting only the differences. Written in C, it functions as a standalone command-line application, facilitating incremental backups, data mirroring, and general file synchronization across systems. It supports communication via SSH, rsh, or a daemon mode for public file distribution and is primarily targeted at system administrators and users requiring efficient and secure file transfer capabilities. The project provides extensive documentation, including man pages and a dedicated website, with options for building and installing the software from source.
