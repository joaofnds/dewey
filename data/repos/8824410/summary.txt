`termito` is a Clojure library providing a term rewriting system, inspired by and extending the functionality of the `kibit` rule system. It enables symbolic manipulation and simplification of expressions, particularly within the domain of mathematical and logical transformations. Key features include rule definition for arithmetic and derivative operations, demonstrated through examples of symbolic differentiation. Designed as a library, `termito` can be integrated into Clojure projects for tasks requiring automated expression simplification and transformation.
