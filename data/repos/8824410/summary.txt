Termito is a Clojure-based term rewriting system designed for symbolic computation and mathematical expression manipulation. Built for functional programming environments, it enables developers to define pattern-matching rules that automatically transform and simplify symbolic expressions through systematic rewriting. The library targets computational mathematics, computer algebra systems, and academic research domains where symbolic manipulation is required. Using Clojure's pattern matching capabilities with variables (prefixed with ?), developers can create rule sets for arithmetic simplification, calculus operations like derivatives, and other mathematical transformations. Inspired by the kibit static analysis tool, Termito provides a more feature-rich rule engine for expression rewriting. The system is particularly valuable for researchers, mathematical software developers, and educational technology creators working on symbolic math problems, theorem proving, or building computer algebra functionality within Clojure applications.
