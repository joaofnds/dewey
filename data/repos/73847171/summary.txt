Oils is a Unix shell implementation that provides an upgrade path from bash scripting to more modern shell languages. The project consists of two main components: OSH (Oil Shell), which maintains backward compatibility with existing bash scripts, and YSH (Your Shell), designed as a more user-friendly alternative for Python and JavaScript developers who typically avoid shell scripting. Written primarily in Python for development ease and readability, the codebase uses custom transpilation tools to automatically convert Python code to C++ for production deployment, eliminating Python runtime dependencies. This targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who need robust shell scripting capabilities with improved syntax, better error handling, and modern language features while maintaining compatibility with existing bash-based automation and infrastructure scripts.
