`Oils` is a Python-based project developing a new Unix shell and runtime environment, offering an upgrade path from bash and a shell alternative for Python and JavaScript users. It features OSH, which runs existing shell scripts, and YSH, a new shell language. The project utilizes custom tools to translate the Python code to C++ for performance and a small footprint, resulting in an executable that doesn't depend on Python. Oils is a developer productivity tool, and its target audience appears to include developers familiar with shell scripting and Python, aiming to improve the shell experience and offering an alternative for those avoiding traditional shell scripting.
