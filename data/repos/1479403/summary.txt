frab is a Ruby on Rails-based conference management system designed for event organizers to handle the complete lifecycle of technical conferences and similar events. Built for the conference organization domain, it provides comprehensive functionality for collecting talk submissions, managing speakers and presentations, creating schedules, and handling multi-track events. The system integrates with ticket servers (OTRS, RT, Redmine) for automated communication workflows and supports multi-language localization through Rails i18n and the mobility gem. Used by major technical conferences like FrOSCon and Chaos Communication Congress, frab targets conference organizers and event managers who need to coordinate complex multi-day events with dozens of speakers, parallel tracks, and hundreds of submissions while maintaining automated workflows for speaker communications and schedule generation.
