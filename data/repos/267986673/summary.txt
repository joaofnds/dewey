Ferris is an open-source hardware project for designing and manufacturing minimalistic 34-key split mechanical keyboards, targeting ergonomic typing enthusiasts and custom keyboard builders. The repository contains KiCad PCB designs, Python-based build automation scripts, and comprehensive assembly documentation for multiple keyboard variants supporting Choc and MX switches. It leverages Docker containerization for automated PCB validation, gerber file generation, and release artifact creation through GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. The project addresses the custom mechanical keyboard market by providing fully open-source hardware designs with QMK and ZMK firmware support, focusing on portability, low-profile aesthetics, and ease of assembly. Primary users include DIY keyboard enthusiasts, makers, and developers interested in ergonomic input devices who want to manufacture their own split keyboards.
