Emojicode is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language, utilizing emojis for its syntax.  The repository hosts the compiler for this language, along with associated tools and build instructions, enabling developers to write and execute code using emojis. It supports object-oriented programming, optionals, generics, and closures.  Built primarily in C and employing CMake and potentially Ninja for building, the project includes a Docker build configuration and targets developers interested in experimenting with a novel, emoji-based programming paradigm.
