Emojicode is an experimental programming language compiler implemented in C that uses emoji characters as syntax elements instead of traditional text-based keywords and operators. Built with LLVM 7 for code generation and CMake for build management, it provides a complete compiler toolchain supporting object-oriented programming, generics, optionals, and closures. The language targets general-purpose programming education and novelty use cases rather than production software development, serving as both a technical demonstration of alternative syntax paradigms and an educational tool for understanding compiler construction. Primary users include programming language researchers, educators, and developers interested in experimental language design, offering a functional multi-paradigm environment while exploring non-conventional approaches to programming language syntax and human-computer interaction in software development.
