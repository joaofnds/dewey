Semantic UI is a CSS/JavaScript component framework designed for front-end web development that provides 50+ pre-built UI elements with semantic HTML class naming conventions. Built with LESS/CSS preprocessing and JavaScript, it offers 3000+ CSS variables with three-level inheritance for theming customization, EM-based responsive design, and flexbox compatibility. The framework integrates with React, Angular, Meteor, and Ember applications and includes interactive components like dropdowns, modals, sidebars, and tooltips. It targets web developers building user interfaces who need a comprehensive design system with intuitive debugging capabilities. The framework uses Gulp-based build tools and supports multiple distribution methods including npm, Bower, and CDN integration for modern browser environments.
