RedisWebManager is a Ruby-based Rails engine that provides a web-based administrative interface for monitoring and managing Redis database instances. Built as a mountable Rails application, it targets web developers and system administrators who need to visualize Redis performance metrics, manage key-value data, and monitor client connections through a browser interface. The tool offers dashboard functionality for tracking memory usage, CPU utilization, and connected clients, along with key management capabilities for editing and deleting Redis keys. It supports multi-instance Redis configurations, implements HTTP basic authentication for security, and requires background job integration (Sidekiq, Sucker Punch, or ActiveJob) for data collection. This DevOps-focused tool addresses the need for accessible Redis database administration without requiring command-line expertise, serving development teams managing Redis-backed web applications.
