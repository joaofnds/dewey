Vimish Fold is an Emacs Lisp package that implements Vim-style text folding functionality within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. Targeting software developers and technical writers who work in Emacs but prefer Vim's folding behavior, it provides manual region-based folding, automatic folding between customizable markers (like `{{{` and `}}}`), and persistent fold state management across buffer sessions. The package integrates with Emacs' overlay system to provide visual feedback without breaking indentation, includes mouse support for fold toggling, and offers optional integration with the `avy` package for efficient fold creation. It addresses the problem of code organization and navigation in large files by allowing users to collapse and expand text sections while maintaining fold persistence across editing sessions, making it particularly valuable for developers working with extensive codebases or configuration files.
