Fennel is a Lisp-to-Lua compiler that transpiles Lisp syntax into efficient Lua bytecode with zero runtime overhead. It targets embedded systems, game development, and lightweight scripting domains where Lua's ~200kb VM footprint and LuaJIT performance are advantageous. The compiler provides full Lua compatibility, compile-time macros, pattern matching, and destructuring while maintaining readable output that resembles hand-written Lua. Fennel addresses the verbosity and irregular syntax of Lua by offering Lisp's uniform s-expression syntax with immutable-by-default semantics, comprehensive destructuring, and macro extensibility. It serves developers building extensions for games, databases, window managers, and other applications where Lua is already embedded, offering functional programming paradigms without sacrificing Lua's simplicity or performance characteristics.
