Fennel is a Lisp programming language that compiles to Lua, designed for ease of use and efficient Lua code generation. It offers full Lua compatibility, zero overhead compared to hand-written Lua, and compile-time macro support. The project is a standalone compiler and a one-file library, allowing embedding for runtime extensibility and interactive development, enabling users to leverage Lua's features within a more structured, Lisp-like syntax and benefit from LuaJIT's performance.
