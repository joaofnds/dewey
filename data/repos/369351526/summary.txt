Markwhen is a text-to-timeline visualization tool that converts markdown-like syntax into interactive cascading timelines for project management and event visualization. Built as a modular Vue.js application with a view container architecture, it serves developers, project managers, and content creators who need to visualize temporal data. The system features a distributed architecture with separate repositories for parsing, timeline rendering, calendar views, and a VSCode extension. It supports multiple date formats (American/European, ISO8601), multimedia content, locations, and Gantt chart functionality. The core repository acts as a view container that orchestrates different visualization components, enabling custom view development through a client library API. Users can self-host components and integrate the tool into development workflows via the VSCode extension or web editor.
