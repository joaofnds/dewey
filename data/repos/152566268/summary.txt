`ttyplot` is a C-based command-line utility designed for real-time plotting of numerical data within terminal environments. It reads data from standard input, typically piped from monitoring tools such as `ping`, `snmpget`, and `vmstat`, and visualizes it as a dynamically updating text-based graph. Key features include support for rate calculation for counters, dual-graph display using reverse video, customizable plot characters and colors, and interactive key bindings for control. It's a standalone CLI application, targeting system administrators, network engineers, and developers needing to monitor system metrics and network throughput directly from the command line.
