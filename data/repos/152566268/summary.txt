ttyplot is a lightweight C-based command-line utility designed for real-time system monitoring and network performance visualization in terminal environments. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and network engineers, it transforms streaming data from stdin into ASCII-based time-series plots displayed directly in the console. The tool integrates seamlessly with Unix pipelines, processing output from monitoring commands like ping, vmstat, iostat, snmpget, sar, and netstat to generate live graphical representations of metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network throughput, and system load. Supporting both single and dual-line plotting with rate calculation for counter-based metrics, ttyplot serves as a terminal-native alternative to GUI monitoring tools, enabling immediate visual feedback for system performance analysis without requiring graphical desktop environments or external dependencies.
