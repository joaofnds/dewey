This repository is a curated collection of PostgreSQL software, libraries, tools, and resources organized into comprehensive categories including high-availability solutions, backup tools, GUI clients, monitoring systems, extensions, and language bindings. It serves as a centralized reference for database administrators, DevOps engineers, and backend developers working with PostgreSQL deployments across various environments from development to production. The collection covers critical operational areas like disaster recovery (Barman, pgBackRest), clustering and failover (Patroni, Stolon, repmgr), performance optimization, Docker containerization, Kubernetes orchestration, and PaaS solutions. It addresses the core challenge of navigating PostgreSQL's extensive ecosystem by providing vetted tools for database management, monitoring, scaling, and integration across different programming languages and cloud platforms.
