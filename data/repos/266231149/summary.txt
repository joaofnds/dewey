Logseq is an open-source knowledge management platform built with Clojure/ClojureScript that implements a local-first, privacy-focused approach to personal knowledge management (PKM). The application creates interconnected knowledge graphs from Markdown and Org-mode files, enabling bidirectional linking between notes, blocks, and concepts. It operates entirely on local file systems with Git-based version control, supporting both hierarchical and graph-based information organization through block-level references and backlinks. The platform targets knowledge workers, researchers, and individuals requiring sophisticated note-taking systems with spatial canvas features, PDF annotation capabilities, and plugin extensibility. Logseq addresses the domain of personal information management by providing a desktop application that combines traditional outlining with modern graph database concepts while maintaining data ownership and avoiding vendor lock-in.
