**iHateRegex** is a Vue.js/Nuxt.js web application that serves as an educational regex cheat sheet and visualization tool for web developers. Built with TailwindCSS for styling, the platform provides visual representations of regular expressions, interactive testing environments, and embeddable regex visualizations for integration into other websites. The application addresses the common developer pain point of understanding and debugging complex regular expressions by offering syntax highlighting, validation, pattern matching demonstrations, and detailed markdown-based explanations. It maintains a curated collection of common regex patterns (email validation, URLs, usernames, etc.) stored in JSON format, making regex more accessible to developers who struggle with traditional regex syntax and documentation.
