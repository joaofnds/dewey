REBL is a standalone, graphical interactive tool designed for browsing Clojure data, extracted from Datomic tools. It provides a two-pane browser/viewer system for inspecting Clojure collections and their contents, supporting navigation, expression evaluation, and a history of evaluations. The application offers features such as capturing nested values, running multiple independent UI windows, metadata viewing, Datafy support, and extensibility, with full keyboard control. Built with JavaFX and intended for use in a Clojure development environment, REBL runs within the application's JVM process.
