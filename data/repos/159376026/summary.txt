REBL is a deprecated JavaFX-based graphical debugging and data inspection tool specifically designed for Clojure development environments. It provides a two-pane browser interface for interactively exploring nested Clojure data structures, collections, and metadata during REPL-driven development workflows. The tool integrates with both stdio-based and nREPL sessions, capturing expression evaluations and enabling developers to navigate complex data hierarchies through a structured GUI rather than text-based output. Originally extracted from Datomic's internal tooling by Cognitect, REBL addressed the challenge of visualizing and traversing deeply nested functional data structures that are common in Clojure applications. It targeted Clojure developers working in interactive development environments who needed better data introspection capabilities beyond traditional REPL text output, though it has since been superseded by the Morse project.
