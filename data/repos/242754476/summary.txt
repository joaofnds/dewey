Heroicons is an open-source SVG icon library designed for web UI development, providing over 200 hand-crafted vector icons optimized for modern web applications. Built by the Tailwind CSS team, it offers icons in multiple variants (outline, solid) and sizes (16x16, 20x20, 24x24 pixels) with dedicated JavaScript packages for React (@heroicons/react) and Vue (@heroicons/vue) frameworks. The library addresses the common need for consistent, scalable iconography in web interfaces by providing MIT-licensed SVG assets that integrate seamlessly with CSS styling and utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS. Icons are distributed as individual React/Vue components and raw SVG files, enabling tree-shaking and optimized bundle sizes for front-end developers building responsive web applications and component libraries.
