Schema is a Clojure/ClojureScript library for declarative data structure validation and type annotation, targeting functional programming teams building web services and APIs. It provides a lightweight alternative to full type systems by using data-driven schemas to describe and validate complex nested data structures like maps, vectors, and records. The library offers runtime validation with descriptive error messages, function argument/return value annotation, automatic data coercion, and integration with testing frameworks. Key features include schema composition, optional validation during development/testing, and compatibility with property-based testing via schema-generators. Primarily used by Clojure developers building backend services, APIs, and data processing pipelines who need better data shape documentation and validation without the overhead of static typing systems.
