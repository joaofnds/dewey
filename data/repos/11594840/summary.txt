`plumatic/schema` is a Clojure(Script) library providing declarative data description and validation capabilities, primarily aimed at improving data handling within Clojure projects. It enables developers to define schemas for data shapes, facilitating function argument and return value documentation, runtime data validation with descriptive error messages, and schema-driven data coercion for type conversions. Key features include schema-driven validation, coercion, and integration with Clojure's type hinting system via macros such as `s/defschema`, `s/defn`, and `s/def`, with optional schema generation and completion for testing. The library's features are implemented in Clojure and ClojureScript, offering cross-platform capabilities with support for coercion from formats like JSON.
