Lucide is an open-source SVG icon library providing 1000+ vector icons for web and mobile development, forked from Feather Icons. Built with TypeScript, it offers framework-specific packages for React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, and React Native, enabling developers to integrate consistent iconography across JavaScript/TypeScript applications. The toolkit addresses the common problem of maintaining design consistency and implementing scalable vector icons in modern frontend frameworks. It includes tooling for icon optimization, automated package generation, and Figma integration for design workflows. Target users are frontend developers, UI/UX designers, and development teams building web applications who need a reliable, framework-agnostic icon system with tree-shaking support and consistent styling across component libraries.
