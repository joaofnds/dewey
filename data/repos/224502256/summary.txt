**muesli/reflow** is a Go library providing ANSI-sequence aware text formatting algorithms for terminal and CLI applications. It offers modular packages for word-wrapping, unconditional text wrapping, indentation, dedentation, and padding operations that preserve ANSI escape sequences used for terminal styling and colors. The library implements `io.Writer` and `io.WriteCloser` interfaces for stream processing and provides both string-based and writer-based APIs. Targeted at Go developers building command-line tools, terminal user interfaces, and CLI applications, it solves the complex problem of text reflow operations in terminal environments where ANSI escape codes would normally interfere with character counting and text layout calculations, enabling proper text formatting while maintaining colored and styled terminal output.
