`reflow` is a Go library providing ANSI-sequence aware text reflow operations for terminal output. It offers functionalities including word-wrapping, unconditional wrapping, indentation, dedentation, and padding of text blocks, all while correctly handling ANSI escape codes. The library implements `io.Writer` interfaces, enabling integration with existing Go code that utilizes stream-based text processing. This project is a developer productivity tool aimed at Go developers working with terminal-based applications or command-line interfaces, facilitating formatted text output.
