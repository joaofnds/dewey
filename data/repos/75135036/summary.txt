`json-iterator/go` is a high-performance JSON serialization and deserialization library for Go that serves as a drop-in replacement for Go's standard `encoding/json` package. Targeting backend developers, API engineers, and web service developers working with JSON-heavy applications, this library addresses performance bottlenecks in JSON processing through optimized parsing algorithms and reduced memory allocations. The implementation maintains 100% API compatibility with the standard library while delivering significantly faster encoding/decoding performanceâ€”benchmarks show 6x faster decoding and 2.6x faster encoding compared to the standard library. Key use cases include high-throughput web APIs, microservices, data processing pipelines, and any Go application requiring frequent JSON marshaling/unmarshaling operations where performance is critical.
