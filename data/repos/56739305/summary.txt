`embrace.el` is an Emacs Lisp plugin providing functionality analogous to `evil-surround`, enabling users to add, change, or delete text pairs around a selected region. Leveraging `expand-region` for region selection, the plugin extends Emacs' editing capabilities with surround-like operations. This developer productivity tool targets Emacs users seeking enhanced text manipulation and editing efficiency within the Emacs environment.
