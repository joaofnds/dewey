embrace.el is an Emacs Lisp package that provides text manipulation commands for adding, changing, and deleting surrounding character pairs (parentheses, brackets, quotes, HTML tags, function calls) in code and text. Built specifically for the Emacs text editor ecosystem, it leverages the expand-region package for intelligent text selection instead of relying on evil-mode or vim-style text objects. The package offers three core commands (embrace-add, embrace-change, embrace-delete) and integrates with various programming language modes including C, LaTeX, and Org-mode. It targets Emacs users and developers who want vim-surround-like functionality without using evil-mode, solving the problem of efficiently manipulating paired delimiters during code editing and text processing workflows.
