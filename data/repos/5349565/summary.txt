Presto is a distributed SQL query engine built in Java for processing big data workloads across large-scale clusters. It serves the data engineering and analytics domain by enabling interactive SQL queries on massive datasets stored in various sources including Hadoop, Hive, and data lake architectures. The system uses a coordinator-worker architecture with pluggable connectors to federate queries across heterogeneous data sources without requiring data movement. Built with Maven and requiring Java 8+, Presto targets data engineers, analysts, and platform teams who need low-latency SQL analytics on petabyte-scale data. It solves the problem of slow batch processing by providing interactive query performance on distributed data, making it suitable for ad-hoc analysis, reporting, and ETL operations in enterprise big data environments.
