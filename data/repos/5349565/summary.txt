Presto is a distributed SQL query engine for big data, enabling interactive and batch data analysis across diverse data sources like Hadoop and Hive. Implemented in Java, it provides a standard SQL interface for querying large datasets, facilitating data lakehouse architectures. Key functionalities include SQL query processing, distributed execution across a cluster of worker nodes, and support for various data connectors. This standalone application is built using Maven and integrates with IntelliJ IDEA for development, providing a CLI for querying and a UI for the Presto console.
