This repository provides Apple's SF Mono font patched with Nerd Fonts glyphs, targeting developers and system administrators who use terminal-based development environments. The patched font combines SF Mono's clean monospace typography with Nerd Fonts' extensive collection of programming icons, symbols, and glyphs commonly used in command-line interfaces, text editors, and IDEs. Distributed via Homebrew for macOS installation, it addresses the need for enhanced visual representation in terminal applications, code editors like Vim/Neovim, and development tools that rely on iconographic symbols for file types, Git status, and UI elements. The solution serves the developer tooling ecosystem by providing better visual context in text-based programming environments.
