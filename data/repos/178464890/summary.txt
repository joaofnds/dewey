This repository is ZSA Technology Labs' fork of QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware, specifically tailored for their Oryx keyboard configurator. It provides embedded C firmware for custom mechanical keyboards including the ErgoDox EZ, Planck EZ, Moonlander Mark I, and Voyager. The fork maintains a lightweight, stability-focused subset of the upstream QMK codebase by removing unnecessary keyboard definitions, user configurations, and documentation while preserving core quantum and tmk_core libraries. It targets hardware enthusiasts, mechanical keyboard users, and embedded developers who need reliable firmware for ZSA's ergonomic keyboard hardware. The repository integrates with ZSA's web-based Oryx configurator to enable custom keymap compilation and deployment, solving the problem of maintaining stable firmware builds for commercial keyboard products while leveraging the broader QMK ecosystem.
