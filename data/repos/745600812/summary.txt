Pkl is a configuration-as-code programming language developed by Apple, designed to replace traditional configuration formats like JSON, YAML, and XML with a type-safe, validation-rich alternative. Built in Java, it targets DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and software developers who manage complex application configurations, Kubernetes deployments, and infrastructure setups. The language combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms with built-in validation capabilities, enabling developers to define reusable configuration templates with compile-time type checking. Pkl addresses configuration management pain points by providing rich tooling including IDE plugins, language server protocol support, and code generation for multiple target languages, while offering seamless integration with existing ecosystems through bindings for Java, Go, Swift, and popular frameworks like Spring Boot.
