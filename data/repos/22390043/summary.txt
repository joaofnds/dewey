Roswell is a comprehensive Common Lisp environment management and distribution tool that serves as an implementation installer, package manager, script launcher, and application builder for the Common Lisp ecosystem. It addresses the historically complex setup and deployment challenges in Common Lisp development by providing a unified command-line interface for installing and switching between multiple Lisp implementations (SBCL, CCL, etc.), managing Quicklisp-based dependencies, creating executable scripts with shebang support, and building standalone applications. The tool integrates with CI/CD pipelines (Travis-CI, CircleCI), provides cross-platform support including Windows, and enables script distribution through GitHub and Quicklisp repositories. Roswell targets Common Lisp developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who need streamlined tooling for Lisp application development, testing, and deployment, effectively modernizing the Common Lisp development workflow with git-like subcommands and automated environment management capabilities.
