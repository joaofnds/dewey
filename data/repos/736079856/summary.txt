**precognition.nvim** is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that enhances Vim motion navigation by displaying real-time hints for available movement commands. It uses Neovim's virtual text and gutter sign APIs to overlay visual indicators showing where cursor motions like `w`, `b`, `e`, `^`, `$`, `{`, `}`, `gg`, and `G` can be executed from the current position. The plugin targets software developers and text editor power users working in terminal-based development environments who want to improve their Vim motion efficiency. It addresses the learning curve and discovery problem of Vim's extensive motion vocabulary by providing contextual, priority-based hints that appear as virtual text overlays. The plugin integrates with Neovim's buffer system, supports customizable highlight groups, filetype exclusions, and provides both command-line and programmatic APIs for toggling visibility states.
