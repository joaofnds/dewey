`ts-fold` is an Emacs package that provides intelligent code folding functionality for software development using the external tree-sitter parsing library (compatible with Emacs 26.1+). Built on top of `elisp-tree-sitter`, it leverages syntax tree analysis to enable precise folding of code blocks, functions, comments, and other language constructs across 40+ programming languages including C/C++, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, and many others. The package offers customizable folding rules through `ts-fold-range-alist` with predefined folding functions for common patterns like sequential blocks, delimited sections, and various comment styles. It includes additional features like folding indicators, summary displays, and line-comment folding plugins. Targeted at Emacs-using software developers and programmers who need efficient code navigation and organization capabilities, ts-fold integrates with evil mode and provides both manual and automatic folding commands to improve code readability and workspace management in large codebases.
