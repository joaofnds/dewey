`ranger.el` is an Emacs Lisp minor mode that enhances the `dired` file manager by emulating features of the `ranger` console file manager. It provides functionalities such as file previews, multi-column directory displays, history navigation, customizable keybindings for common file operations (copy, move, delete), file sorting, and a minimal "deer" mode for single-window operation. This plugin integrates directly with Emacs and extends its file management capabilities, specifically targeting Emacs users seeking an improved file browsing experience within the editor.
