Ranger.el is an Emacs Lisp package that enhances the built-in dired (directory editor) file manager by implementing a ranger-inspired interface within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. Targeting Emacs users and developers who need efficient file system navigation, it transforms dired into a multi-column file browser with parent directory stack visualization, file preview capabilities, and ranger-like keybindings. The package integrates deeply with Emacs infrastructure including image-dired for image previews, bookmark support, and shell integration, solving the problem of limited visual file browsing in traditional Emacs dired mode. It offers both full ranger mode and minimal "deer" mode, providing mouse support, copy/paste functionality, and persistent file operation flags while maintaining compatibility with existing Emacs workflows and dired functionality.
