Napa.js is a multi-threaded JavaScript runtime built on V8, designed to enhance performance in CPU-bound tasks, offering parallel execution capabilities. It functions as a Node.js module, providing an API for object transportation, sharing, and synchronization across JavaScript threads. Key features include support for multiple V8 isolates, NPM integration, and pluggable logging and memory allocation. This C++-based project is a library intended for developers seeking to leverage multi-core architectures for improved JavaScript application performance, especially in scenarios complementing Node.js.
