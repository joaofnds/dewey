Napa.js is a multi-threaded JavaScript runtime built on Google's V8 engine that enables parallel JavaScript execution through multiple isolated worker threads, designed to complement Node.js for CPU-intensive workloads. Originally developed by Microsoft for high-performance iterative services in Bing, it addresses Node.js's single-threaded limitation by providing APIs for object transportation, sharing, and synchronization across JavaScript threads within "zones" (worker pools). The runtime maintains Node.js module compatibility with NPM support while offering both standalone embedding capabilities and Node.js module distribution. Targeting backend JavaScript developers working on computationally heavy applications like parallel algorithms, mathematical computations, and data processing tasks, Napa.js leverages C++ implementation to provide true parallelism for JavaScript applications requiring multi-core utilization without blocking the main event loop.
