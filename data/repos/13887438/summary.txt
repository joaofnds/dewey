`erd` is a Haskell-based command-line application designed to generate visual entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) from plain text descriptions of relational database schemas. It transforms descriptions of entities, attributes, and relationships into graphical representations, leveraging GraphViz for visualization and supporting multiple output formats, including PDF, SVG, and PNG. The primary function is to convert a domain-specific language (`.er` files) for describing database schemas into easily interpretable diagrams. This project type is a standalone CLI application intended for developers managing database schemas.
