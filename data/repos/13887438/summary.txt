**erd** is a Haskell-based command-line utility that converts plain text descriptions of relational database schemas into visual entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs). Targeting database developers, data architects, and software engineers working with relational databases, it parses custom `.er` files containing entity definitions, attributes, and relationship cardinalities, then generates professional diagrams using GraphViz/Dot rendering engine. The tool outputs multiple formats including PDF, SVG, PNG, and EPS, supporting standard ERD notation with primary keys, foreign keys, and relationship multiplicity indicators. It addresses the common need for database documentation and schema visualization without requiring specialized diagramming software, making it particularly valuable for database design workflows, documentation generation, and schema communication in development teams working with SQL databases.
