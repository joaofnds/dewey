TodoMVC is a comparative framework repository that provides identical Todo application implementations across multiple JavaScript MV* frameworks including React, Angular, Vue, Backbone, and Ember. Targeting web developers in the frontend development domain, it serves as a technical reference for evaluating and comparing different JavaScript framework architectures, coding patterns, and implementation approaches. The repository contains standardized Todo app implementations that demonstrate each framework's syntax, data binding, component structure, and state management capabilities. It addresses the framework selection problem by providing side-by-side comparisons of how the same application logic is implemented across different technologies, enabling developers to assess framework complexity, code organization, and development patterns before committing to a specific JavaScript MV* solution for their projects.
