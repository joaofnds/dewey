`k6` is a load-testing tool designed for modern performance testing in the DevOps era, built using Go and JavaScript. Its core functionality centers on simulating traffic to assess application performance, offering features like configurable load generation, tests-as-code with an embedded JavaScript engine, and multiple protocol support, including HTTP and gRPC. This standalone application (CLI) enables developers and testers to define performance tests, integrate them into CI/CD pipelines, and generate detailed results. The project supports an extensive ecosystem for extensions and integrates natively with Grafana Cloud for metrics storage and visualization.
