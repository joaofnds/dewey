k6 is a modern load testing tool built in Go that enables performance testing through JavaScript-based test scripts. Designed for the DevOps and web development domains, it combines Go's performance with JavaScript's accessibility to simulate high-traffic loads on web applications, APIs, and microservices. The tool supports multiple protocols including HTTP, WebSockets, gRPC, and browser automation, allowing developers and QA engineers to write test-as-code scenarios with configurable load generation, performance thresholds, and CI/CD integration. k6 addresses the challenge of scalable performance testing by providing a CLI-based testing framework with extensible architecture, flexible metrics export, and cloud integration capabilities for modern development workflows.
