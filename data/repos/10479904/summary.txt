`bastibe/org-journal` is an Emacs Lisp package designed for journaling within the Org-mode environment. This project provides a specialized mode, integrating Org-mode's structured text format for note-taking and knowledge management, and extends Org-mode for journaling-specific features. It facilitates daily or periodic entries organized within Org files, potentially including features for time tracking, task management, and knowledge organization based on existing Org-mode capabilities. It primarily functions as an Emacs extension, enhancing user productivity by providing a dedicated journaling workflow for Org-mode users.
