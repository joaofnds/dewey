org-journal is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a structured journaling system built on top of org-mode for Emacs users. It targets productivity-focused developers, writers, and knowledge workers who use Emacs as their primary text editor and want to maintain personal journals or daily logs within their existing workflow. The package automatically manages journal files organized by configurable time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly), creates timestamped entries with org-mode formatting, and integrates with Emacs Calendar for navigation and search functionality. Key features include automatic TODO item carryover between journal entries, optional encryption support, and seamless integration with org-mode's hierarchical structure and markup capabilities. It solves the problem of maintaining consistent, searchable personal documentation and reflection practices within the Emacs ecosystem, leveraging org-mode's powerful text organization and markup features for structured journaling workflows.
