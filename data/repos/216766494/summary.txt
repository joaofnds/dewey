**plz.el** is an HTTP client library for Emacs Lisp that provides a modern alternative to Emacs's built-in `url` library by using curl as its backend. Targeting Emacs package developers and power users in the GNU Emacs ecosystem, it offers both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP request capabilities with support for JSON parsing, binary data handling, file uploads, and custom headers. The library addresses common limitations of Emacs's native HTTP functionality by leveraging curl's robust networking capabilities, providing features like request queueing, timeout management, and flexible response processing. It serves developers building Emacs extensions that need reliable web API integration, data fetching, or HTTP-based communication within the Emacs text editor environment.
