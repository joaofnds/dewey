Maddy is a unified mail server implementation written in Go that consolidates multiple email infrastructure components into a single daemon. It provides complete email server functionality including SMTP message transfer agent (MTA) and mail exchange (MX) capabilities, IMAP message storage and retrieval, and integrated email security protocols (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, DANE, MTA-STS). The server replaces traditional multi-component email stacks like Postfix, Dovecot, OpenDKIM, and OpenDMARC with a composable architecture and unified configuration system. Targeted at system administrators and DevOps engineers managing email infrastructure, Maddy addresses the complexity and maintenance overhead of deploying and coordinating separate email services by offering an all-in-one solution with reduced operational complexity for self-hosted email systems.
