`maddy` is a standalone mail server application written in Go, designed to be a composable all-in-one solution for email management. It provides comprehensive functionality, including sending and receiving emails via SMTP (acting as both an MTA and MX), storing emails accessible via IMAP, and implementing essential email security protocols such as DKIM, SPF, DMARC, DANE, and MTA-STS. This project aims to replace multiple existing email server components (Postfix, Dovecot, etc.) with a single daemon, simplifying configuration and reducing maintenance overhead. The project's IMAP storage is currently in beta, while the message delivery features are considered stable.
