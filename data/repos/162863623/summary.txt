`sd` is a high-performance command-line text processing tool written in Rust that serves as a modern replacement for `sed`, targeting developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who need efficient find-and-replace operations. It addresses the complexity and syntax quirks of traditional Unix text manipulation tools by providing intuitive regex syntax compatible with JavaScript/Python patterns, string-literal mode for non-regex operations, and simplified command structure. The tool supports both stdin/stdout processing and in-place file modification, offers indexed and named capture groups, and delivers significant performance improvements (2-12x faster than sed in benchmarks). Built for cross-platform terminal environments, it integrates seamlessly into automation workflows, build pipelines, and daily development tasks where text transformation and pattern matching are required.
