`sd` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool, written in Rust, designed as an intuitive alternative to `sed` for find and replace operations on text. It focuses on simplifying regular expression-based and string-literal search-and-replace tasks, offering features like easier-to-read syntax, string-literal mode to avoid escaping, and in-place file modification capabilities.  The tool supports capturing groups and operates on files, allowing for project-wide replacements in conjunction with other utilities like `fd`.  Performance benchmarks indicate `sd`'s efficiency in both regex and simple replacement scenarios, targeting developers who need an efficient and user-friendly tool for text processing within the terminal.
