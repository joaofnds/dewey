hl-fill-column is an Emacs Lisp package that provides visual highlighting of the fill column in Emacs text editor buffers. Targeting software developers and text editors users, it implements two minor modes (buffer-local and global) to display a visual indicator at the configured fill column position, helping users maintain consistent line length formatting in code and documentation. The package leverages Emacs' font-face system for customizable highlighting appearance and adapts code from the column-marker library. It addresses the common development workflow need for visual line-length guidance during coding and writing, though it has been superseded by Emacs 27's built-in display-fill-column-indicator-mode functionality, making this package obsolete for modern Emacs installations.
