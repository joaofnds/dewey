nodenv is a shell-based Node.js version management tool designed for web developers and DevOps teams working with multiple Node.js applications. Built entirely in shell scripts, it uses PATH manipulation and executable shims to seamlessly switch between different Node.js runtime versions on Unix-like systems. The tool solves environment consistency problems by allowing per-project Node.js version specification through `.node-version` files, ensuring development and production environments match exactly. It integrates with npm and supports plugin extensibility for features like automated Node.js compilation via node-build. Primary users include JavaScript/Node.js developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators managing Node.js deployments across different projects requiring specific runtime versions for compatibility and deployment reliability.
