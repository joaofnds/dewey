`nodenv` is a shell utility designed for managing multiple Node.js versions on a system, providing a version manager for Node.js projects. It enables users to specify and switch between different Node.js runtimes at the application or global level, ensuring consistent development and deployment environments. Key functionalities include shims injected into the `PATH` to intercept Node commands, version selection via `.node-version` files or environment variables, and the ability to install and uninstall Node.js versions. This is a CLI-based developer tool primarily written in Shell, and it is intended for Node.js developers to streamline their workflow and guarantee runtime compatibility.
