The Cloudinary Ruby Gem is a Ruby on Rails SDK that provides programmatic integration with Cloudinary's cloud-based media management platform for web development. It enables Rails developers to upload, transform, optimize, and deliver images and videos through CDN infrastructure using Ruby helper methods like `cl_image_tag` and `Cloudinary::Uploader.upload`. The gem integrates with Rails frameworks including CarrierWave and Active Storage for file handling, supports dynamic media transformations (resize, crop, format conversion), and generates secure URLs for asset delivery. It targets web developers building Rails applications that require scalable image and video processing capabilities, eliminating the need for server-side media manipulation by offloading these operations to Cloudinary's cloud service.
