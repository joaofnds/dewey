Packer is a HashiCorp-developed infrastructure automation tool written in Go that creates identical machine images across multiple cloud platforms and virtualization environments from a single declarative configuration. Targeting the DevOps and cloud infrastructure domain, it addresses the challenge of maintaining consistent server provisioning and deployment pipelines across heterogeneous environments like AWS, Azure, VMware, and Docker. The tool uses a plugin-based architecture to support various builders, provisioners, and post-processors, enabling system administrators and DevOps engineers to automate the creation of golden images, AMIs, and container images. Packer integrates with HashiCorp's ecosystem including Terraform and Vagrant, solving the problem of configuration drift and manual image management in modern cloud-native infrastructure workflows.
