`nerdctl` is a Docker-compatible command-line interface (CLI) for containerd, enabling users to manage containerized applications. Written in Go, it provides a user experience similar to the Docker CLI, supporting Docker Compose for orchestration and features like rootless mode, lazy-pulling via Stargz, Nydus, and OverlayBD, image encryption, and P2P image distribution using IPFS. This standalone application targets developers and system administrators seeking a containerd-focused toolset that streamlines container image management, builds, and deployments with advanced features beyond standard Docker functionality, especially within Kubernetes environments.
