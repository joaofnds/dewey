nerdctl is a Docker-compatible CLI tool for containerd written in Go, targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators managing container workloads. It provides a familiar Docker-like interface while enabling access to containerd's advanced features including lazy-pulling with Stargz/Nydus snapshotter, encrypted images via ocicrypt, P2P distribution through IPFS, rootless containers with bypass4netns, and container signing with cosign. The tool supports Docker Compose workflows, BuildKit integration for image building, CNI networking, and Kubernetes debugging through containerd namespaces. It addresses the gap between Docker's user-friendly CLI and containerd's low-level ctr tool, enabling container runtime experimentation and production deployments with cutting-edge containerd features not available in standard Docker implementations.
