DevEnv is a Nix-based developer environment management tool that provides declarative, reproducible development setups through configuration files. Built primarily in Nix with Rust components, it targets software developers and DevOps engineers who need consistent, isolated development environments across teams and systems. The tool addresses the "works on my machine" problem by enabling developers to define their entire development stack—including packages, services (like PostgreSQL), environment variables, git hooks, and background processes—in a single `devenv.nix` configuration file. It supports multiple programming languages, integrates with direnv for automatic environment activation, includes container building capabilities, and provides process management for development services. DevEnv simplifies the complexity of Nix while maintaining its reproducibility guarantees, making it accessible for teams seeking reliable development environment standardization without deep Nix expertise.
