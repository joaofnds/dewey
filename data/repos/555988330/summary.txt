`devenv` is a developer environment management tool built with Nix, facilitating fast, declarative, and reproducible development environments. It enables users to define environment configurations in `devenv.nix`, incorporating package dependencies, environment variables, scripts, services (e.g., PostgreSQL), and Git hooks. Key functionalities include initializing new environments, activating shells, managing processes, running tests, and interacting with container builds, all managed through a command-line interface. This project is a standalone CLI application targeting software developers seeking streamlined and consistent development workflows, leveraging Nix's package management and environment isolation capabilities.
