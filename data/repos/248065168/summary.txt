Miramare is a Vim color scheme plugin written in Vim script that provides a dark, warm-toned visual theme for code editors. Targeted at software developers across multiple programming domains including web development (Ruby on Rails, HTML, JavaScript, Sass), it offers syntax highlighting optimizations for common file types and development workflows. The plugin integrates with Vim's native color system and popular plugins like vim-airline, featuring customizable options for transparency, italic text rendering, bold fonts, and cursor colors. It addresses the developer experience problem of eye strain and visual comfort during extended coding sessions by providing soft contrast and pleasant aesthetics. The tool supports both traditional Vim installations and modern package managers, requiring true color terminal support for optimal rendering.
