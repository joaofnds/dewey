`create-reagent-app` is a ClojureScript template project designed to quickly scaffold Reagent applications, similar to Create React App. It leverages `clj-new` to generate a project structure with minimal opinion, supporting rapid prototyping and development. The template includes a basic structure with `deps.edn` for dependency management, `index.html`, `style.css`, and example ClojureScript files. Users can set up the application using Clojure CLI tools and configure global aliases for streamlined project creation. This is a developer productivity tool targeting Clojure and ClojureScript developers.
