Create Reagent App is a ClojureScript project template generator that bootstraps single-page web applications using the Reagent framework (ClojureScript wrapper for React.js). Built for frontend web development, it functions as a ClojureScript equivalent to Create React App, utilizing Clojure CLI tools, clj-new templating system, and deps.edn for dependency management. The template generates a minimal project structure with ClojureScript source files, HTML/CSS resources, test directories, and development configuration using cljs.edn build files. It targets ClojureScript developers who want to rapidly scaffold React-based web applications without complex build tool configuration or ejection processes, providing a streamlined alternative to JavaScript-based React toolchains while leveraging Clojure's functional programming paradigm for frontend development.
