Kerla is a monolithic operating system kernel written in Rust that provides Linux ABI compatibility, enabling unmodified Linux binaries to run without modifications. Targeting systems programmers and OS researchers, it implements core Unix process concepts including context switching, signals, fork/execve/wait4 system calls, and supports essential syscalls like write, stat, mmap, pipe, and poll. The kernel features smoltcp-based TCP/IP networking, tmpfs/devfs pseudo filesystems, TTY/PTY support, and runs on x86_64 architecture with QEMU and Firecracker virtualization support. It uses initramfs as the root filesystem and includes experimental Docker image support, addressing the need for a modern, memory-safe kernel implementation while maintaining Linux binary compatibility for research and educational purposes.
