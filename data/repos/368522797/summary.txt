Kerla is a monolithic operating system kernel written in Rust, designed for Linux binary compatibility, enabling the execution of unmodified Linux binaries. It implements core *NIX process concepts and supports common system calls such as `write(2)` and `mmap(2)`.  The kernel includes features like `smoltcp`-based TCP/IP support, tty/pty implementations, and compatibility with QEMU and Firecracker. This project represents a standalone operating system kernel, leveraging Rust for systems programming and targeting developers and system enthusiasts interested in operating system design and Linux compatibility.
