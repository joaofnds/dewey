InfluxDB is a time-series database designed for collecting, processing, and storing metrics, events, and real-time analytics data. Built with Rust, it supports fast query response times and features like object storage, an embedded Python VM for plugins, Parquet file persistence, and compatibility with InfluxDB 1.x and 2.x write APIs. The core functionality allows for efficient monitoring of sensor data, server performance, and application behavior, making it suitable for building user interfaces and automation solutions. This is a standalone application, providing both core database functionality and a CLI.
