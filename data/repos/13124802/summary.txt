InfluxDB is a specialized time-series database designed for high-throughput ingestion and real-time querying of metrics, events, and sensor data. Built primarily in Rust with Go and React components, it targets DevOps, monitoring, and IoT domains where fast data collection and sub-10ms query response times are critical. The database features a diskless architecture with object storage support, Parquet file persistence, an embedded Python VM for extensibility, and compatibility with multiple query interfaces including SQL, FlightSQL, and InfluxQL. It serves system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers building monitoring dashboards, application performance monitoring (APM) systems, financial analytics platforms, and IoT data collection pipelines that require near real-time data processing and visualization capabilities.
