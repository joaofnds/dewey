Docker Compose is a standalone command-line application written in Go for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications. It enables users to define application services, their configurations, and dependencies within a `compose.yaml` file adhering to the Compose file format. Functionality includes building images, starting and stopping containers, and managing the entire application lifecycle with a single `docker compose up` command, streamlining orchestration for containerized deployments. This project serves as a developer productivity tool focused on simplifying the creation and operation of multi-container Docker applications.
