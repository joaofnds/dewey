Docker Compose v2 is a container orchestration tool written in Go that enables developers and DevOps engineers to define, configure, and manage multi-container Docker applications through declarative YAML configuration files. It addresses the complexity of coordinating multiple containerized services by providing a unified interface to start, stop, and scale entire application stacks with single commands. The tool implements the Compose file specification to orchestrate service dependencies, networking, volumes, and port mappings across containers. Primarily targeting web development and microservices deployment workflows, it integrates with the Docker ecosystem and CLI plugins architecture, allowing developers to replace complex multi-step Docker commands with simplified `docker compose up` operations for local development and testing environments.
