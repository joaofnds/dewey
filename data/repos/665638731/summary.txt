DBOS Transact is a TypeScript library that provides durable execution capabilities for web applications and backend services by persisting workflow execution state in PostgreSQL. It enables developers to build fault-tolerant, long-running workflows using decorator-based annotations (@DBOS.workflow(), @DBOS.step()) that automatically handle crash recovery and resume interrupted processes. The library targets full-stack TypeScript developers working on business-critical applications, background job processing, event streaming (Kafka), distributed task queues, cron scheduling, and AI agent orchestration. By leveraging PostgreSQL as the sole persistence layer, it eliminates external workflow orchestration dependencies and integrates directly into existing Node.js and Next.js applications, solving reliability issues in distributed systems through lightweight, database-backed state management for complex multi-step operations.
