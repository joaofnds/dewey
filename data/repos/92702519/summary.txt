Sealed Secrets is a Kubernetes-native solution for secure secret management in GitOps workflows, consisting of a cluster-side controller and the `kubeseal` CLI tool written in Go. It addresses the fundamental DevOps challenge of storing Kubernetes secrets in version control systems by implementing asymmetric encryption to transform standard Kubernetes Secret objects into SealedSecret custom resources that can be safely committed to public repositories. The controller running in the target cluster holds the private key for decryption, while developers use the public key via `kubeseal` to encrypt secrets that only the specific cluster can decrypt. This architecture enables GitOps practitioners and DevOps engineers to maintain complete infrastructure-as-code workflows without compromising sensitive data, supporting namespace-scoped encryption and automatic secret rotation for production Kubernetes environments.
