`sealed-secrets` is a Kubernetes controller and CLI tool designed to encrypt and manage Kubernetes Secrets. It addresses the challenge of securely storing sensitive configuration in Git repositories by encrypting Secrets into `SealedSecret` custom resources, decryptable only by the controller within a cluster. Key functionalities include asymmetric encryption via `kubeseal`, enabling GitOps workflows for Secrets, and facilitating secret rotation. The project, written in Go, leverages a controller-operator pattern and integrates with Kubernetes, allowing users to create, manage, and update secrets within a GitOps environment. It is primarily a developer productivity tool for DevOps teams focused on securing Kubernetes deployments.
