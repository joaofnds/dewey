Iroh is a Rust library and framework designed for building peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. Its core functionality centers on enabling direct connections between nodes by leveraging QUIC for authenticated encryption and stream multiplexing, including hole-punching and relay server fallback mechanisms. It provides APIs for establishing connections via public keys and includes protocols such as iroh-blobs for content-addressed blob transfer and iroh-gossip for overlay networks. The project comprises multiple crates, including a core library, a relay server implementation, and utilities for DNS and networking analysis, targeting developers building distributed and decentralized applications.
