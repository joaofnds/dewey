Iroh is a Rust-based peer-to-peer networking library that provides authenticated direct connections between nodes using public key addressing. Built on QUIC protocol via Quinn, it implements NAT hole-punching with relay server fallbacks to establish the fastest possible connections between peers. The library targets distributed systems developers building P2P applications, offering composable protocols including content-addressed blob transfer (iroh-blobs), publish-subscribe gossip networks (iroh-gossip), and eventually-consistent key-value stores (iroh-docs). Iroh solves the complex networking challenges of P2P connectivity by abstracting away NAT traversal, connection management, and protocol negotiation, enabling developers to focus on application logic rather than low-level networking infrastructure in decentralized application development.
