Biome is a high-performance web development toolchain written in Rust that provides code formatting and static analysis capabilities for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, CSS, JSON, and GraphQL. It serves as a unified alternative to separate tools like Prettier and ESLint, offering 97% compatibility with Prettier formatting and over 270 linting rules. The toolchain targets frontend developers and web development teams, providing CLI commands and Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration for real-time editor support. Biome addresses the fragmentation of web development tooling by consolidating formatting, linting, and code quality analysis into a single, fast binary that doesn't require Node.js runtime, enabling efficient code maintenance and consistent styling across modern web projects.
