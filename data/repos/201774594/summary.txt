SCI (Small Clojure Interpreter) is a configurable, sandboxed Clojure/ClojureScript interpreter designed for safe code evaluation and DSL implementation. Built in Clojure, it provides secure execution of user-provided code across JVM, GraalVM native compilation, and JavaScript environments. The interpreter enables controlled evaluation without the security risks of standard `eval`, making it suitable for scripting tools, configuration DSLs, interactive programming environments, and embedded Clojure execution. SCI powers development tools like Babashka (CLI scripting), Clerk (notebooks), clj-kondo (linting), and browser-based Clojure environments. Target users include Clojure developers building applications requiring safe code evaluation, tool creators needing embedded scripting capabilities, and organizations implementing domain-specific languages with Clojure syntax while maintaining security boundaries.
