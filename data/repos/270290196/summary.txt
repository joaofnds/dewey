Ergogen is a JavaScript-based ergonomic keyboard layout generator, designed to create custom 2D layouts and generate associated physical components such as plates, cases, and un-routed PCBs. It provides a configuration format for defining layouts and integrates with web-based deployments for user interaction. This project serves as a developer productivity tool, leveraging a web UI and CLI functionality (for advanced use) to facilitate the creation of ergonomic keyboards, likely targeting enthusiasts and keyboard builders.
