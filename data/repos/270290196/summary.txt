Ergogen is a JavaScript-based generator tool for the mechanical keyboard and hardware design domain that automates the creation of ergonomic keyboard layouts from configuration files. It takes declarative 2D layout specifications and generates manufacturing-ready outputs including plates, cases, and unrouted PCB designs for custom ergonomic keyboards. The tool targets keyboard enthusiasts, hardware designers, and makers who need to rapidly prototype and manufacture custom ergonomic keyboards without manual CAD work. Built with JavaScript and deployable as both a web application and CLI tool, Ergogen bridges the gap between keyboard layout conceptualization and physical manufacturing by providing a unified configuration format that eliminates the need for specialized PCB design software for basic ergonomic keyboard projects.
