Directus is a TypeScript-based headless CMS and database abstraction layer that automatically generates REST and GraphQL APIs from existing SQL databases. Built on Node.js with a Vue.js admin dashboard, it supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MariaDB, MS-SQL, and other SQL databases without requiring schema migrations. The platform provides real-time API generation, authentication, role-based access control, and a no-code content management interface for non-technical users. Targeted at web developers and backend engineers, Directus solves the problem of rapidly building content management systems and admin panels by transforming any SQL database into a fully-featured headless CMS with instant API endpoints, eliminating the need to build custom backend infrastructure from scratch.
