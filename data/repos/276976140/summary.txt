mergestat-lite is a Go-based command-line tool that provides SQL query capabilities for git repository analysis and source code mining. Built on SQLite, it enables developers and DevOps engineers to execute structured queries against git metadata, commits, file changes, and repository contents without requiring complex shell scripting. The tool supports both local and remote repository querying, with output formats including JSON, CSV, and NDJSON for integration with data pipelines and reporting workflows. It addresses the common problem of extracting insights from version control systems by offering a familiar SQL interface for code analytics, repository auditing, and development metrics generation. Target users include software engineers, data analysts, and engineering managers who need programmatic access to git repository data for performance monitoring, code review analysis, and project reporting in CI/CD environments.
