TiKV is a distributed transactional key-value database written in Rust, designed for large-scale data infrastructure and cloud-native applications. It implements ACID-compliant transactions using the Raft consensus algorithm for consistency and RocksDB for storage, supporting horizontal scaling to 100+ TB deployments. The system provides geo-replication, snapshot isolation, and externally consistent distributed transactions similar to Google Spanner. Originally created to serve as the storage layer for TiDB (a distributed SQL database), TiKV targets database engineers, infrastructure teams, and organizations requiring scalable transactional storage systems. It solves the challenge of maintaining data consistency and ACID properties across distributed clusters while providing both key-value and transactional APIs for modern distributed applications.
