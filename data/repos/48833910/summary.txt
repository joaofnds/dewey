TiKV is a distributed, transactional key-value database built in Rust, designed to complement TiDB, a distributed HTAP database. It provides ACID-compliant transactions, key-value and transactional APIs, and features like geo-replication and horizontal scalability. Utilizing the Raft consensus algorithm for data consistency, with RocksDB for storage, and the Placement Driver for auto-sharding, TiKV supports distributed transactions inspired by Google's Spanner and Percolator. This standalone database aims to provide a robust, scalable storage solution for various applications and is a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
