This is a battery management utility for Apple Silicon Macs that provides both CLI and GUI interfaces for controlling charging behavior to extend battery longevity. Built with JavaScript/Electron for the GUI and shell scripting for the CLI, it integrates with macOS System Management Controller (SMC) to programmatically enable/disable charging based on user-defined thresholds (typically 80%). The tool addresses hardware power management by allowing system administrators and power users to override default charging behavior, maintaining specific charge levels when devices remain plugged in for extended periods. It leverages the `smc` binary from smcFanControl project for low-level hardware interaction and provides persistent charging limits that survive reboots, targeting Mac users who need granular control over battery charging cycles for device longevity optimization.
