`battery` is a standalone JavaScript application providing a CLI and GUI for managing battery charging behavior on Apple Silicon Macs. It enables users to maintain their battery at a user-defined level, such as 80%, to prolong battery lifespan by preventing overcharging. The application uses a combination of a GUI built with Electron and a command-line tool, which utilizes a precompiled `smc` tool (from `hholtmann/smcFanControl`) and the `battery` script itself, both installed to `/usr/local/bin`. The project primarily targets Apple Silicon Mac users seeking granular control over their device's charging process.
