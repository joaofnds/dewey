Forge is an Emacs Lisp extension that integrates Git forge platforms (GitHub, GitLab) directly into Magit, the popular Git porcelain for Emacs. It enables developers to manage pull requests, issues, and other forge-specific workflows without leaving their Emacs environment. The package provides a unified interface for interacting with remote repository hosting services through their APIs, allowing users to browse, create, and modify issues and pull requests from within Magit buffers. Targeting Emacs-based developers and DevOps practitioners who prefer terminal/editor-centric workflows, Forge eliminates context switching between development environments and web browsers for Git forge operations, streamlining the code review and project management process within the Emacs ecosystem.
