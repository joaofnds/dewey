`forge` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to facilitate interaction with Git forges directly within the Magit interface. It extends Magit's capabilities by providing tools to manage and interact with remote repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab. This plugin enables users to perform forge-specific actions, improving developer workflow efficiency within the Emacs environment. As a plugin, it integrates with the existing Magit Git client to enhance developer productivity.
