This repository provides a production-ready Docker containerization solution for Apache Airflow, an open-source workflow management platform used in data engineering and ETL pipelines. Built on Python 3.7-slim-buster with PostgreSQL backend and Redis queue support, it enables data engineers and DevOps teams to deploy Airflow with multiple execution modes including SequentialExecutor, LocalExecutor, and CeleryExecutor for distributed task processing. The solution addresses the complexity of Airflow deployment by offering pre-configured Docker Compose files, support for custom plugins, environment-based configuration management, and integration with external dependencies. Target users include data engineers, platform engineers, and system administrators who need to orchestrate complex data workflows, ETL processes, and batch job scheduling in containerized environments without manual Airflow installation and configuration overhead.
