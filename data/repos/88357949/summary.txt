i3status-rust is a system status bar replacement written in Rust that implements the i3bar protocol for Linux window managers, specifically targeting i3 and Sway users. It displays configurable "blocks" of system information including time, battery status, volume, network metrics, and other hardware monitoring data through a resource-efficient statusbar interface. The application uses TOML configuration files, supports theming and icon customization, and integrates directly with tiling window manager configurations. Built for system administrators and Linux power users who require lightweight, customizable system monitoring in their desktop environments, it serves the Linux desktop/window manager ecosystem by providing real-time system status visualization with lower resource consumption than traditional status bar implementations while maintaining extensive configurability through Rust's performance characteristics.
