`skunk` is a Ruby gem providing a SkunkScore calculator designed to assess technical debt in Ruby codebases. It integrates with RubyCritic and SimpleCov to measure code complexity, code smells, and code coverage, generating a "SkunkScore" that identifies files needing refactoring or increased testing. This command-line tool allows users to generate reports, compare feature branches, and share SkunkScore results via a web service (https://skunk.fastruby.io), promoting code quality analysis and offering insights into the technical debt of Ruby projects. The project type is a developer productivity tool, focusing on code quality analysis for Ruby developers.
