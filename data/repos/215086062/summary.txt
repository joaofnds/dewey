Skunk is a Ruby static code analysis tool that calculates technical debt metrics by combining code complexity, code smells, and test coverage data. Built as an extension to RubyCritic, it generates a "SkunkScore" for Ruby files and projects to identify problematic code areas with high complexity but low test coverage. The tool integrates with SimpleCov for coverage analysis and provides developers with prioritized lists of files that are candidates for refactoring or additional testing efforts. Primarily targeting Ruby web application developers and maintainers working on legacy codebases, Skunk helps teams make data-driven decisions about where to focus their technical debt reduction efforts by highlighting the intersection of complex, untested code that poses the highest risk for future maintenance issues.
