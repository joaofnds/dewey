Wails is a cross-platform desktop application framework that enables Go developers to create native desktop applications using web frontend technologies. It combines Go backends with modern web UI frameworks (React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte) into single binaries without embedding a browser, instead utilizing native rendering engines on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The framework provides bidirectional communication between Go and JavaScript, auto-generated TypeScript definitions for Go structs/methods, native OS dialogs and menus, and a CLI toolchain for project scaffolding and compilation. Targeted at Go programmers in desktop application development, Wails solves the problem of creating rich graphical interfaces for Go applications without requiring separate web servers or browser dependencies, positioning itself as a lightweight alternative to Electron with better performance and smaller resource footprint.
