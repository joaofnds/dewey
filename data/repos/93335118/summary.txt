Jason is a high-performance JSON parser and generator library written in pure Elixir, designed for web development and distributed systems built on the Erlang/Elixir ecosystem. It provides RFC 8259 and ECMA 404 compliant JSON encoding/decoding functionality that significantly outperforms existing Elixir libraries like Poison while maintaining performance comparable to C-based implementations like jiffy. The library integrates seamlessly with popular Elixir web frameworks and database libraries including Phoenix, Ecto, Postgrex, and Absinthe, serving as the default JSON codec for modern versions of these tools. Jason targets Elixir developers building web APIs, real-time applications, and microservices who require fast, standards-compliant JSON processing without external dependencies or NIFs, offering protocol-based encoding customization and optimized memory usage for production Elixir applications.
