`denote` is an Emacs Lisp package providing a note-taking system based on a file-naming scheme for efficient organization and retrieval of notes and other files. It streamlines note creation by enforcing predictable and descriptive filenames, independent of metadata, promoting consistent file management. The package facilitates file renaming and linking within Emacs, supporting various file types. It functions as an Emacs extension and is designed for users of the Emacs text editor.
