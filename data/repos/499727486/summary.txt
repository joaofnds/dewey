Denote is an Emacs Lisp package that implements a structured note-taking system for Emacs users through a predictable file-naming scheme. It targets knowledge workers, researchers, and developers who use Emacs as their primary text editor for personal knowledge management and documentation workflows. The package automates the creation of files with descriptive, standardized names that encode metadata directly in the filename, eliminating dependency on external databases or complex organizational systems. Denote provides linking capabilities between notes and file management utilities that work across any file type, not just text documents. It addresses the problem of inconsistent file organization and retrieval in note-taking workflows by enforcing naming conventions that make files self-describing and easily searchable through standard filesystem tools, integrating seamlessly with Emacs' existing buffer and file management infrastructure.
