Meeseeks is an Elixir library designed for parsing and extracting data from HTML and XML documents using CSS selectors and XPath queries. Built for web scraping and data extraction workflows, it leverages the Rust-based html5ever parser via NIFs to provide browser-grade HTML5 parsing performance. The library targets backend developers working in web development, data science, and automation who need to programmatically extract structured data from web pages or XML feeds. It offers a functional API for document parsing, element selection, and data extraction, supporting both permissive XML parsing and strict HTML5 standards. The library eliminates the complexity of manual DOM traversal by providing intuitive selector-based querying, making it suitable for building web scrapers, content aggregators, and data pipeline components within Elixir/Phoenix applications.
