Meeseeks is an Elixir library designed for parsing and extracting data from HTML and XML documents using CSS and XPath selectors. It provides a friendly API with features including a browser-grade HTML5 parser, permissive XML parsing, and support for custom selectors. The library leverages the `html5ever` Rust library (via `meeseeks_html5ever`) and offers helpers for data extraction from selections. As a library, Meeseeks targets Elixir developers seeking a robust tool for web scraping and data extraction tasks within their applications.
