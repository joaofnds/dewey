`ripgrep` is a command-line utility written in Rust that performs recursive searches for regular expression patterns within files and directories, efficiently respecting `.gitignore` rules to exclude unwanted files. Key features include fast searching, support for Unicode and various file encodings, automatic filtering of hidden and binary files, and integration with PCRE2 for advanced regex syntax, offering replacements and preprocessor capabilities. This standalone CLI application targets developers and system administrators seeking a performant alternative to tools like `grep` and `ack` for code search and file content analysis.
