Quil is a Clojure wrapper around the Processing graphics framework designed for creative coding, data visualization, and generative art applications. It provides functional programming interfaces to Processing's drawing and animation APIs, enabling developers to create interactive graphics, animations, and visual art using Clojure's immutable data structures and functional paradigms. The library supports both JVM Clojure and ClojureScript environments, targeting creative technologists, data visualization developers, and digital artists who prefer functional programming approaches over Processing's imperative Java-based syntax. Quil abstracts Processing's setup/draw loop paradigm into Clojure functions while maintaining full access to graphics primitives, mathematical functions, and interactive event handling, making it suitable for educational programming, artistic installations, and prototype visualization tools.
