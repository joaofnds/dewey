TLP is a Shell-based command-line utility for Linux systems designed to optimize laptop battery life through automated power management. Operating in the system administration and Linux power management domain, it provides dual-profile configuration supporting both battery (BAT) and AC power states with pre-optimized default settings. The tool targets system administrators, Linux users, and laptop power management scenarios by automatically controlling hardware components like CPU frequency scaling, disk power management, USB autosuspend, and wireless device power states. Written primarily in Shell scripting, TLP integrates with Linux kernel power management subsystems to deliver transparent battery optimization without requiring deep technical knowledge from end users, while maintaining extensive customization capabilities for advanced users.
