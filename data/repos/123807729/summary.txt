AutoEq is a Python-based audio signal processing tool that automatically generates headphone equalization settings from frequency response measurements. Targeting the audiophile and audio engineering domain, it processes CSV frequency response data from major measurement sources (oratory1990, crinacle, Rtings) to compute parametric and convolution equalizer parameters that flatten headphone frequency responses to target curves like Harman standards. The system includes a web application (autoeq.app), PyPI-distributed library with parametric EQ optimization algorithms supporting shelf filters and peaking filters, and a comprehensive database of over 3,000 headphone measurements. It serves audio enthusiasts, headphone reviewers, and developers working with audio DSP, solving the complex mathematical problem of converting frequency response deviations into actionable equalizer settings for various audio applications and hardware.
