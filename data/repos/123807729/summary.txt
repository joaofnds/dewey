AutoEq is a Python library and command-line tool designed for automatically equalizing headphone frequency responses. The project's core functionality includes generating equalizer settings from headphone measurements obtained from multiple sources and optimizing parametric equalizers, with a focus on producing settings compatible with various equalizer applications. The project features a web application interface for ease of use, a PyPi package for library installation, and data collections of headphone measurements and target frequency responses. Targeting developers, it utilizes Python, leverages dependencies like `libsndfile`, and employs virtual environments for dependency management and offers utilities for both command-line use and programmatic access.
