`hyperfine` is a command-line benchmarking tool written in Rust, designed for accurately measuring the execution time of shell commands. It provides statistical analysis of multiple runs, support for arbitrary shell commands, and features like warmup runs, cache clearing, and outlier detection. The tool can export results to various formats (CSV, JSON, Markdown, etc.) and supports parameterized benchmarks. It is a standalone CLI application for developers and system administrators to assess the performance of command-line tools and scripts across different platforms.
