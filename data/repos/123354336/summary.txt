This repository provides a Clojure-based backend implementation of the RealWorld specification for a web application. It leverages the Polylith architecture for modularity and Ring for web server handling, offering CRUD operations and authentication functionalities, among other advanced patterns. Serving as a real-world example, the project showcases best practices for building web backends in Clojure, targeted at Clojure developers interested in learning or applying Polylith and Ring within a standard application context.
