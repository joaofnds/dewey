This repository demonstrates a full-stack web backend implementation following the RealWorld specification, built using Clojure's Polylith architecture pattern with Ring web framework. It serves as a reference implementation for backend developers learning modular monolith architecture in Clojure, showcasing CRUD operations, JWT authentication, REST API design, and advanced patterns like pagination. The codebase uses Polylith's component-based architecture to organize business logic into reusable components (user, article, comment, database) and a REST API base, enabling better code organization and testability. Target users are Clojure developers and software architects interested in exploring functional programming approaches to web service development, particularly those evaluating alternatives to microservices architecture for building maintainable backend systems.
