Mongoose is a JavaScript object modeling tool (ODM) designed for asynchronous environments, specifically built to interact with MongoDB databases. It provides schema definition, validation, middleware, and various features like embedded documents and plugins to facilitate MongoDB data modeling and interaction within Node.js and Deno (alpha) applications. This library enables developers to structure and manage MongoDB data in a more object-oriented manner, offering methods for connecting, defining models, querying, and manipulating data within a JavaScript application. It functions as a core backend library for Node.js and Deno developers working with MongoDB.
