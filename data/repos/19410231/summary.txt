This repository contains a comprehensive personal dotfiles collection targeting Linux system administrators and power users who utilize Emacs-centric productivity workflows. The configuration primarily centers around Emacs Doom, org-mode task management, and ledger-cli financial tracking, with extensive shell scripting for system integration. Key components include org-mode agenda synchronization scripts that generate SVG outputs for mobile devices, automated time tracking with arbtt integration, Borg backup automation with GPG encryption, and XMonad window manager configurations. The technical stack encompasses Emacs Lisp configurations, Python scripts for org-mode integration, shell utilities for keyboard layout switching, PulseAudio HDMI management, and systemd services for wallpaper automation. This setup addresses the need for unified productivity tooling across desktop environments, particularly for users requiring sophisticated task management, time tracking, and system automation capabilities.
