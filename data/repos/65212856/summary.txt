GitLens is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance Git workflows and improve code understanding and collaboration. Written in TypeScript, it provides in-editor Git blame annotations, hovers, and CodeLens to visualize code authorship, and offers features like interactive commit graphs, revision navigation, and AI-powered assistance for tasks such as generating commit messages and PR descriptions. GitLens extends VS Code's source control capabilities, targeting developers to streamline code review, manage PRs through Launchpad and Worktrees (Pro features), and facilitate team collaboration with Cloud Patches and Code Suggest, ultimately improving developer productivity within the VS Code environment.
