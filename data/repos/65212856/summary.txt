GitLens is a TypeScript-based Visual Studio Code extension that enhances Git integration and repository management for software developers. The extension provides in-editor Git blame annotations, CodeLens overlays, hover information, and interactive commit graph visualization to expose code authorship and change history. It targets web developers, software engineers, and development teams working with Git repositories, offering features like pull request management, branch navigation, commit graph interactions, and integration with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. The extension addresses the problem of understanding code evolution and collaboration context within large repositories by surfacing Git metadata directly in the VS Code editor interface, enabling developers to make informed decisions about code changes and streamline code review workflows.
