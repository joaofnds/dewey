Postmodern is a Common Lisp library providing a native PostgreSQL database interface for Lisp developers working on database-driven applications. It implements direct socket-based communication with PostgreSQL servers without requiring foreign libraries, featuring UTF-8 support, S-SQL syntax for embedding SQL within Lisp code, prepared statements, stored procedures, and DAO (Data Access Object) metaclasses for object-relational mapping. The library embraces PostgreSQL-specific features rather than pursuing cross-database portability, distinguishing it from generic SQL libraries like CLSQL. Targeted at Common Lisp developers building enterprise applications, web backends, or data processing systems that require efficient PostgreSQL integration, it solves the problem of seamless database connectivity while maintaining Lisp's expressive syntax and avoiding the overhead of external database abstraction layers.
