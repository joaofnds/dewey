`Plug` is an Elixir library providing a specification and connection adapters for composing web applications using functions, operating within the web application backend domain. It enables developers to build modular web applications through reusable "plugs" for request/response handling and includes `Plug.Router` for route definition and WebSocket support. The library supports several web server implementations, including Cowboy and Bandit, and offers a suite of built-in plugs such as `Plug.Logger`, `Plug.Session`, and `Plug.Static`, extending the framework's capabilities. This library is designed as a building block for Elixir web frameworks, such as Phoenix.
