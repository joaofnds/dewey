Plug is an Elixir library that provides a specification and framework for composing web applications through functional composition in the Erlang Virtual Machine ecosystem. It serves as the foundational HTTP middleware layer for Elixir web development, offering connection adapters for multiple web servers including Cowboy (Erlang-based) and Bandit (Elixir-based). The library enables developers to build modular web applications by chaining small, reusable functions that transform HTTP requests and responses, supporting both traditional HTTP handling and WebSocket connections through its upgrade API. Plug is primarily used by Elixir web frameworks like Phoenix and targets backend web developers building scalable, concurrent web services who need low-level HTTP request/response manipulation, routing capabilities, and server-agnostic deployment options within the functional programming paradigm.
