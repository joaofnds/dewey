`httparrot` is an Elixir-based HTTP server replicating functionality similar to `httpbin.org`, designed for integration testing and API endpoint simulation. Built upon the Cowboy framework and employing `cowboy_rest` handlers, it provides endpoints for simulating various HTTP request and response scenarios, including GET, POST, and DELETE methods, along with functionalities like redirects, cookie management, authentication challenges, and content encoding. This standalone web application facilitates developers in testing and debugging HTTP client interactions.
