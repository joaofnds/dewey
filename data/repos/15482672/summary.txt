HTTParrot is an HTTP testing server built in Elixir using the Cowboy web framework, designed as a clone of HTTPBin for web development and integration testing scenarios. It provides a comprehensive suite of REST endpoints that simulate various HTTP behaviors including request/response inspection, authentication challenges (Basic and Digest), redirects, cookie handling, streaming, delays, and WebSocket echo functionality. The server uses cowboy_rest handlers to expose endpoints for testing HTTP clients, APIs, and web services by returning structured responses containing request metadata, headers, and payloads. Targeted at web developers, QA engineers, and DevOps professionals, HTTParrot serves as a reliable testing harness for validating HTTP client implementations, debugging API integrations, and creating repeatable test scenarios without requiring external dependencies or complex mock server configurations.
