quic-go is a pure Go implementation of the QUIC protocol (RFC 9000, RFC 9001, RFC 9002) with support for HTTP/3 (RFC 9114), including QPACK (RFC 9204) and HTTP Datagrams (RFC 9297). It also implements additional RFCs such as Unreliable Datagram Extension (RFC 9221), Datagram Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD, RFC 8899), QUIC Version 2 (RFC 9369), and QUIC Event Logging using qlog. This project serves as a foundation for WebTransport over HTTP/3 (draft-ietf-webtrans-http3) in [webtransport-go](https://github.com/quic-go/webtransport-go). quic-go is a library, primarily used by projects like AdGuardHome, algernon, caddy, and cloudflared for implementing fast, secure, and efficient network communication solutions.
