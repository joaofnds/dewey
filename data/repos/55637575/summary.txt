quic-go is a pure Go implementation of the QUIC transport protocol (RFC 9000-9002) and HTTP/3 (RFC 9114), targeting network and web infrastructure developers. The library implements core QUIC features including multiplexed streams, connection migration, and 0-RTT handshakes, along with HTTP/3 support via QPACK compression and HTTP datagrams. It provides both client and server APIs for building modern web applications, reverse proxies, CDNs, and networking tools that require low-latency, reliable transport over UDP. The implementation includes advanced features like unreliable datagrams, path MTU discovery, and qlog event logging. Major adopters include Caddy web server, Cloudflare's tunneling daemon, and various proxy/tunneling solutions, making it essential infrastructure for Go developers building next-generation web services and network applications requiring QUIC/HTTP3 capabilities.
