`color-thief` is a JavaScript library designed to extract the dominant color palette from images, functioning both in web browsers and Node.js environments. It provides the core functionality of analyzing image data to identify and return a palette of representative colors, enabling applications to dynamically derive color schemes. The project comprises separate source files for browser and Node.js compatibility, leveraging a shared core module and includes browser tests using Cypress and Node tests via Karma and Mocha. This is a JavaScript library primarily intended for frontend developers or developers integrating image color analysis into their web or server-side applications.
