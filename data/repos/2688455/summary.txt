Color Thief is a JavaScript library for extracting dominant color palettes from images, targeting web developers working on visual design applications, content management systems, and image processing workflows. Built with pure JavaScript using quantization algorithms, it provides cross-platform compatibility for both browser environments (ES6, AMD, CommonJS) and Node.js server-side applications. The library solves the problem of programmatic color analysis for developers building themes, UI customization features, or visual content tools. It employs canvas-based pixel manipulation in browsers and image processing libraries in Node.js, enabling developers to automatically generate color schemes from user-uploaded images or existing visual content without external dependencies.
