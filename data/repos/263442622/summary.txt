OpenRewrite is an automated source code refactoring engine built in Java that performs large-scale code transformations using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) manipulation. The framework targets software development teams managing technical debt, framework migrations, security fixes, and code standardization across Java codebases. It operates through a recipe-based system that executes predefined refactoring patterns via Maven and Gradle plugins, enabling developers to automate repetitive code modernization tasks that traditionally require manual intervention. The tool addresses enterprise software maintenance challenges by providing programmatic code transformations for framework upgrades, dependency migrations, and coding standard enforcement. Primary users include Java developers, DevOps engineers, and platform teams responsible for maintaining large-scale applications and ensuring consistent code quality across multiple repositories.
