`openrewrite/rewrite` is a Java-based refactoring engine designed for automated mass modification of source code, enabling developers to refactor Java projects at scale. It utilizes an abstract syntax tree (AST) to identify and apply refactoring recipes, supporting tasks like framework migrations, security fixes, and stylistic consistency enforcement. This open-source project provides build tool plugins (Gradle, Maven) to execute prepackaged recipes, making it a developer productivity tool for improving code quality and reducing technical debt. It is a library providing refactoring tools, with a strong focus on the Java ecosystem.
