`SpiceDB` is an open-source, cloud-native database designed for scalably storing and querying fine-grained authorization data, inspired by Google's Zanzibar system. Built in Go, it provides a gRPC API optimized for authorization, enabling developers to define schemas, store data, and query access control information. Key functionalities include fine-grained access control (FGAC) and support for ABAC, RBAC, and ReBAC authorization models, with features such as reverse indexes and schema validation tooling. It is a standalone, distributed database and is intended for use by platform and backend developers building and securing cloud-native applications.
