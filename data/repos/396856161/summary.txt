SpiceDB is an open-source authorization database written in Go that implements Google's Zanzibar paper for scalable fine-grained access control. It provides a gRPC API for storing and querying permission relationships, supporting RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC authorization models through a custom schema language. The system targets cloud-native and distributed applications where centralized authorization decisions are required across microservices architectures. Platform engineers and backend developers use SpiceDB to replace application-level permission logic with a dedicated service that handles complex queries like "what can user X access?" and "who can edit resource Y?" The database supports global consistency guarantees, reverse indexing, and integrates with Kubernetes environments, addressing the OWASP #1 security threat of broken access control in web applications.
