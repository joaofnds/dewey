The modus-themes repository provides highly accessible color themes for GNU Emacs that strictly conform to WCAG AAA standards for color contrast ratios. Built in Emacs Lisp, these themes target software developers, technical writers, and accessibility-conscious users who require optimal readability and compliance with web accessibility guidelines. The package includes two core themes (modus-operandi light and modus-vivendi dark) with extensive customization options and support for numerous Emacs packages. It addresses the critical problem of eye strain and accessibility barriers in code editors by ensuring maximum contrast between foreground and background elements while optimizing for red-green color deficiency. The themes are integrated into Emacs 28+ core distribution and serve the broader software development community requiring accessible development environments.
