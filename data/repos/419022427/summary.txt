CosmicNvim is a pre-configured Neovim distribution written in Lua, specifically tailored for web development workflows. It provides an opinionated IDE-like experience for JavaScript/TypeScript developers working with frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte. The configuration integrates native LSP functionality with automated server installation via mason.nvim, syntax highlighting through nvim-treesitter, fuzzy finding with Telescope, file management via nvim-tree, and autocompletion using nvim-cmp. It includes preconfigured formatters, linters, and development tools optimized for modern web development stacks. The distribution targets frontend and full-stack JavaScript developers seeking a VSCode-alternative editor experience with Vim keybindings, eliminating the complexity of manually configuring Neovim plugins and LSP servers for web development projects.
