ScyllaDB is a high-performance NoSQL database engine written in C++ that provides API compatibility with Apache Cassandra (CQL) and Amazon DynamoDB. Built on the Seastar asynchronous framework, it implements a shared-nothing architecture designed for real-time big data workloads requiring low-latency and high-throughput operations. The system targets distributed database deployments in cloud and enterprise environments, utilizing C++23 features and modern compilation toolchains. ScyllaDB addresses the performance limitations of traditional JVM-based NoSQL databases by leveraging native C++ execution and advanced memory management. Primary users include database administrators, backend developers, and infrastructure engineers managing large-scale distributed systems that need Cassandra-compatible interfaces with significantly improved performance characteristics for time-series data, IoT applications, and high-frequency transactional workloads.
