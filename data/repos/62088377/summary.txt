Kompose is a Go-based command-line tool designed to convert Docker Compose specifications into Kubernetes resources. It streamlines the transition from local Docker Compose environments to Kubernetes, translating `compose.yaml` files into Kubernetes deployments, services, and other necessary manifests. Key functionalities include automated conversion, supporting various installation methods (binary, Go, Docker, etc.), and providing shell autocompletion for Bash, Zsh, and Fish. This project is a standalone developer productivity tool, enabling developers to rapidly deploy applications defined in Compose to Kubernetes clusters.
