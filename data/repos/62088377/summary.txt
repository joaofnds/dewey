Kompose is a command-line conversion tool written in Go that translates Docker Compose specification files into Kubernetes resource manifests, targeting the DevOps and container orchestration domain. The tool addresses the migration challenge faced by developers and system administrators who need to transition containerized applications from local Docker Compose environments to Kubernetes clusters. Kompose parses docker-compose.yaml files and automatically generates corresponding Kubernetes deployments, services, and other resource definitions, eliminating manual YAML authoring for basic workload migrations. The tool serves DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and developers working with containerized applications who require automated conversion between Docker Compose and Kubernetes orchestration formats, streamlining the adoption of Kubernetes for teams already familiar with Docker Compose workflows.
