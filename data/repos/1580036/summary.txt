iTerm2 is a macOS terminal emulator built in Objective-C that provides an enhanced command-line interface for developers, system administrators, and power users. It replaces the default macOS Terminal application with advanced features including split panes, search functionality, autocomplete, paste history, and extensive customization options. The application targets the developer tools and system administration domains, serving users who require sophisticated terminal capabilities for software development, server management, shell scripting, and command-line operations. iTerm2 integrates deeply with macOS using Cocoa frameworks and AppKit, offering native performance while extending standard terminal functionality with features like session restoration, profile management, and advanced text rendering to improve productivity in command-line workflows.
