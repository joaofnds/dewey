This Emacs Lisp library implements transducers, a functional programming pattern for memory-efficient data stream processing originally developed in Clojure. It provides composable operations like map, filter, take, and drop that can be chained without intermediate memory allocation, making it suitable for processing large datasets, files, or infinite data streams within Emacs environments. The library targets Emacs Lisp developers and data processing workflows, offering transformations (t-map, t-filter), reducers (t-count, t-vector), and data sources (t-file-read, t-buffer-read) with support for CSV/JSON processing. It solves the problem of inefficient collection processing by decoupling transformation logic from specific data structures, enabling ergonomic data pipeline construction for text processing, file manipulation, and data analysis tasks within the Emacs ecosystem.
