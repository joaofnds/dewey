deck.gl is a WebGL2-powered data visualization framework enabling high-performance rendering of large datasets, particularly suited for geospatial analysis. Built with TypeScript, it provides a library of pre-built visual layers, cartographic projections, and interactive event handling capabilities for tasks like picking and filtering. Users can construct visualizations by mapping data to visual layers within views, with options for standalone scripting, React, and Python integrations via `pydeck`. This is a library for developers, particularly those focused on frontend visualization and geospatial applications.
