`docopt.clj` is a Clojure library implementing the docopt language, designed for parsing command-line arguments based on a usage string. It provides a `docopt` macro and a `-docopt` function for argument parsing, allowing developers to define command-line interfaces declaratively using docstrings. The library supports Java interoperability and includes a test suite sourced from the reference docopt implementation. Primarily a developer productivity tool, it enables Clojure developers to create command-line applications with user-friendly interfaces by automatically generating argument parsers.
