docopt.clj is a Clojure implementation of the docopt command-line interface description language, designed for developers building CLI applications in Clojure or Java environments. It parses docstrings written in docopt format to automatically generate command-line argument parsers, eliminating manual argument parsing code. The library provides both compile-time macros for Clojure and runtime functions for Java interoperability, targeting the developer tooling and system administration domains. Built on Clojure's parsing capabilities, it handles complex CLI patterns including options, arguments, subcommands, and usage validation. The tool serves Clojure developers creating command-line utilities, DevOps engineers building automation scripts, and Java developers needing robust argument parsing through a declarative documentation-driven approach rather than imperative configuration.
