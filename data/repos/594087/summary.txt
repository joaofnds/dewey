pgloader is a specialized data migration and ETL tool written in Common Lisp that facilitates database migration to PostgreSQL from multiple source systems including MySQL, SQLite, MS SQL Server, CSV files, dBase, and IXF formats. It leverages PostgreSQL's COPY command for high-performance bulk data loading while providing robust error handling through separate rejection files, allowing transactions to continue despite individual record failures. The tool performs automatic data transformation and type casting (such as converting MySQL's invalid timestamps to PostgreSQL NULL values), supports parallel loading, and can migrate complete database schemas including tables, indexes, and foreign keys. Designed for database administrators and DevOps engineers, pgloader addresses the critical problem of seamless database migration by handling the complexities of cross-platform data type inconsistencies and providing a single-command migration solution that maintains data integrity while maximizing throughput in enterprise database migration scenarios.
