Sidekiq is a high-performance background job processing library for Ruby applications, designed to handle asynchronous task execution using a thread-based architecture. Built on Redis for job queuing and persistence, it targets Ruby web developers working with Rails applications and other Ruby frameworks who need to offload time-intensive operations like email sending, image processing, or API calls from their main request-response cycle. The library leverages multi-threading to process jobs concurrently within a single process, supporting Redis 7.0+, Ruby 3.2+, and Rails 7.0+ environments. Sidekiq integrates with Active Job and provides a web UI for monitoring, delivering throughput of 20,000+ jobs per second for I/O-bound tasks, making it essential infrastructure for scalable Ruby web applications requiring reliable background processing capabilities.
