`test.check` is a Clojure library providing property-based testing capabilities, inspired by QuickCheck. It enables developers to write concise tests defining properties that functions should satisfy for all inputs, rather than specifying individual test cases. Key functionalities include generators for creating test input and support for shrinking failing test cases. This library is a developer productivity tool, operating within the Clojure ecosystem, and facilitates rigorous testing of Clojure code.
