test.check is a property-based testing library for Clojure that implements QuickCheck-style generative testing. It enables developers to write tests by defining properties that functions should satisfy across all inputs, rather than manually specifying individual test cases with expected outputs. The library automatically generates random test data and includes shrinking capabilities to minimize failing cases for easier debugging. Built specifically for the Clojure ecosystem, it integrates with existing Clojure testing workflows and supports both Clojure and ClojureScript. The tool targets Clojure developers working on functional programming projects who want to improve test coverage and discover edge cases through automated property verification, particularly useful for testing mathematical functions, data transformations, and invariant properties in functional codebases.
