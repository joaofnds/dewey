Rustlings is an interactive educational tool designed to teach Rust programming language fundamentals through hands-on coding exercises. Built as a command-line application in Rust, it provides a structured learning path with small, focused programming challenges that cover core Rust concepts including ownership, borrowing, pattern matching, error handling, and concurrency. The repository targets beginner and intermediate developers transitioning to systems programming who want to gain practical experience with Rust's unique memory safety features and syntax. Each exercise is designed as a failing test case that learners must fix, providing immediate feedback through Rust's compiler messages. This tool serves the systems programming and low-level development domain, helping developers build competency in Rust for applications like operating systems, web backends, blockchain, and performance-critical software where memory safety and zero-cost abstractions are essential.
