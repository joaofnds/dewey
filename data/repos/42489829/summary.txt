`rust-lang/rustlings` is a command-line application and educational project designed to help users learn the Rust programming language. It provides a series of small, interactive exercises focused on reading and writing Rust code, including understanding compiler messages. The project's core functionality revolves around a "watch mode" that guides users through exercises, automatically rerunning tests upon file changes, and an exercise list for navigation. Built in Rust, this project is targeted at beginners and individuals seeking a hands-on approach to learning Rust.
