`GoogleChromeLabs/howto-components` is a collection of educational JavaScript web components demonstrating common UI patterns, explicitly designed as a learning resource rather than a production-ready UI library. Leveraging modern web technologies like Custom Elements v1 and ESnext, the project focuses on accessibility, performance, and progressive enhancement. The repository provides example implementations and includes testing via Mocha, Chai, and Karma, with Docker support for cross-browser compatibility. It is an example/template project, targeting frontend developers interested in understanding and implementing web components.
