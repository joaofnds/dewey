This repository provides educational web components that demonstrate modern web UI pattern implementations using Custom Elements v1, ES6+, and progressive enhancement techniques. Targeting web developers in the frontend development domain, it serves as a learning resource for building accessible, performant web components rather than a production UI library. The codebase focuses on common interface patterns like tabs, tooltips, and form controls, emphasizing Web Standards compliance and accessibility best practices. Built with vanilla JavaScript and modern web APIs, it integrates with Google's Web Fundamentals documentation platform to teach developers how to create standards-based custom elements without framework dependencies. The components prioritize educational value through literate programming approaches, making implementation details transparent for learning purposes.
