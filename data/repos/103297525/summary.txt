go-nanoid is a Go implementation of the NanoID specification for generating cryptographically secure, URL-safe unique identifiers. Targeting web developers and backend engineers, it provides a compact alternative to UUIDs using a 64-character alphabet (A-Za-z0-9_-) to produce 22-character IDs with equivalent collision resistance. The library leverages Go's crypto/rand package for cryptographic randomness and offers both default ID generation and custom alphabet/length configuration. It addresses the need for shorter, URL-friendly identifiers in web applications, APIs, and distributed systems where UUID length creates usability issues. The package serves Go developers building web services, microservices, and database applications requiring unique identifiers that are more compact and readable than traditional UUIDs while maintaining security guarantees.
