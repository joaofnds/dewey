`go-nanoid` is a Go library for generating compact, URL-friendly, and cryptographically safe random IDs, mirroring the functionality of the JavaScript nanoid library. It provides functions to generate unique IDs, supporting both default generation and customizable generation with a specified alphabet and length.  This library is designed for developer productivity, enabling the creation of unique identifiers suitable for use cases where UUIDs might be less optimal, such as short URLs or other scenarios requiring concise IDs. The project is implemented in Go and intended for use in Go applications.
