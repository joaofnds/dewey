Audio Router is a Windows desktop application written in C++ that provides per-application audio routing capabilities, allowing users to redirect audio streams from individual programs to different audio output devices. The software operates in the system audio domain, leveraging Windows audio APIs to intercept and reroute application audio streams at the process level. It targets Windows power users, audio enthusiasts, and content creators who need granular control over audio device assignment for multiple applications simultaneously. The application features audio duplication for multi-device output, automatic routing persistence, peak meters for audio monitoring, and requires administrator privileges for low-level audio system integration. It addresses the limitation of Windows' global audio device switching by enabling application-specific audio routing without requiring expensive commercial alternatives like CheVolume.
