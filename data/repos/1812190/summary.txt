Blackfriday is a Markdown-to-HTML processor library implemented in Go, targeting web developers and content management applications. It converts Markdown syntax into HTML output with support for common extensions like tables, smart punctuation, and Smartypants formatting. The library emphasizes security by safely handling user-supplied input and provides UTF-8 unicode compatibility. Built as a Go translation of the C-based Sundown processor, it offers both v1 and v2 APIs with the newer version featuring a cleaner interface and abstract syntax tree generation through a separate Parse function. The library integrates with HTML sanitizers like Bluemonday for processing untrusted content and includes a command-line tool for standalone Markdown processing, serving developers building web applications, documentation systems, and content publishing platforms.
