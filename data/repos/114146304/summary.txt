`svu` is a Go-based command-line utility designed to manage semantic versioning for software projects. It automates the process of incrementing version numbers based on Git commit history, providing commands to determine the next version (major, minor, patch) according to conventional commit standards. The utility supports configuration via a `.svu.yml` file and integrates with release scripts and workflows to streamline the versioning process, targeting developers who require automated version management for their Go projects. It is a standalone CLI application.
