**svu** is a command-line semantic versioning utility written in Go that automates version management for software release workflows in the DevOps domain. It analyzes Git commit history using Conventional Commits specification to automatically determine the next semantic version (major, minor, or patch) based on commit message patterns like `feat:`, `fix:`, and breaking change indicators. The tool integrates into CI/CD pipelines and release scripts, enabling developers and release engineers to programmatically generate version tags without manual intervention. Supporting multiple installation methods including Homebrew, Docker, and package managers, svu streamlines version bumping processes by parsing Git logs and applying semantic versioning rules, making it particularly valuable for automated release management in continuous deployment environments.
