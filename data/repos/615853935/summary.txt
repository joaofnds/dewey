Apache Iggy is a high-performance message streaming platform built from scratch in Rust, designed for real-time data processing and distributed systems architecture. It targets backend developers and platform engineers building event-driven applications requiring ultra-low latency message queuing. The platform supports multiple transport protocols (QUIC, TCP, HTTP) and implements persistent append-only logs with custom zero-copy serialization for maximum throughput. Key features include consumer groups, partitioned topics, configurable retention policies, and TLS encryption. Iggy serves as an alternative to Apache Kafka for use cases demanding submillisecond tail latencies, offering single binary deployment with built-in CLI management tools for stream processing workloads.
