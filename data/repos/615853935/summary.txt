Apache Iggy is a high-performance, persistent message streaming platform written in Rust, designed for processing millions of messages per second with low latency. It supports multiple transport protocols including QUIC, TCP, and HTTP, offering features like message storage, consumer groups, and server-side message deduplication. Built from the ground up with low-level I/O for efficiency, Iggy provides a RESTful API and client SDKs in multiple languages, targeting developers seeking a high-throughput, low-latency alternative to traditional messaging systems. This standalone application includes a CLI, Web UI, and a benchmarking tool, with future plans for clustering based on Viewstamped Replication.
