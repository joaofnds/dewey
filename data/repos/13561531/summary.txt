evil-matchit is an Emacs Lisp package that ports Vim's matchit functionality to Emacs, enabling developers to navigate between matching code delimiters and tags using the "%" key binding. It supports over 25 programming languages and markup formats including HTML, JavaScript, Python, C/C++, React JSX, LaTeX, and SQL, automatically detecting and jumping between paired elements like HTML tags, brackets, parentheses, and language-specific constructs (if/endif, begin/end blocks). The package integrates with EVIL mode for vi-like keybindings but functions independently without it, providing text objects for selecting and deleting code blocks bounded by matching pairs. Targeted at software developers and technical writers working across multiple programming languages in Emacs, it solves the common problem of navigating complex nested code structures and markup documents efficiently.
