Mastodon is a free, open-source, federated social network server built using Ruby on Rails, enabling users to self-host their microblogging communities. It provides a platform for publishing links, pictures, text, and video, interoperable with other ActivityPub-compatible software. Key features include real-time timeline updates, media attachments, safety and moderation tools, and OAuth2 support, accessible via REST and Streaming APIs. The application's frontend utilizes React.js and Redux, with Node.js powering the streaming API, and it relies on PostgreSQL and Redis. It is a standalone, web-based application targeting users seeking a decentralized social media experience.
