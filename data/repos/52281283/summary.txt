Mastodon is an open-source, self-hosted microblogging server implementation built on Ruby on Rails that enables federated social networking through the ActivityPub protocol. The platform serves the social web domain by providing a decentralized alternative to centralized social media platforms, allowing users to create interconnected communities across multiple server instances. The technical stack combines Ruby on Rails for the REST API backend, React.js with Redux for the frontend interface, Node.js for real-time streaming capabilities, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Redis for caching. It implements WebFinger for user discovery and supports Docker deployment configurations. The software targets system administrators and developers seeking to deploy federated social network infrastructure, offering OAuth2 API access, moderation tools, media handling, and cross-platform interoperability within the broader fediverse ecosystem.
