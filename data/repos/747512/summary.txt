The `clojure/clojure` repository hosts the source code for the Clojure programming language. This project defines the core functionalities of Clojure, including its syntax, compiler, runtime environment, and standard library. Written in Java, it serves as the implementation of a functional, dynamically-typed programming language designed to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), offering features that facilitate concurrency and immutable data structures. This project is a core language implementation and serves a developer audience interested in functional programming paradigms.
