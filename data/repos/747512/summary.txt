This repository contains the reference implementation of the Clojure programming language, a functional Lisp dialect that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Built primarily in Java with ASM bytecode manipulation framework for code generation, it compiles Clojure source code to JVM bytecode and provides a complete runtime environment including a REPL, persistent data structures, and concurrency primitives. The implementation targets software developers working across domains including web development, data processing, concurrent systems, and enterprise applications who need functional programming capabilities with JVM interoperability. It solves the problem of bringing modern functional programming paradigms like immutability, higher-order functions, and software transactional memory to the mature JVM ecosystem while maintaining seamless Java integration.
