ncc is a Node.js bundling tool that compiles JavaScript/TypeScript applications and their dependencies into single executable files, similar to compiled languages like Go. Built on webpack, it targets Node.js developers working in serverless environments, npm package publishing, and deployment optimization. The tool provides zero-configuration bundling with built-in TypeScript support, dynamic require handling, binary addon compatibility, and source map generation. It addresses the problem of reducing deployment artifacts, minimizing cold start times, and simplifying dependency management in serverless functions and containerized Node.js applications. The CLI and programmatic API support various output formats including ES modules and CommonJS, with features like minification, caching, and watch mode for development workflows.
