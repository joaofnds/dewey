Pi-hole is a standalone application designed as a network-wide ad blocker, operating within the network administration and privacy domain. It functions as a DNS sinkhole, blocking unwanted content across devices without client-side software installation, and can optionally act as a DHCP server. Core functionalities include a command-line interface for administration, a responsive web interface dashboard for monitoring and control, and a lightweight, efficient DNS query caching mechanism. The project is primarily built using shell scripting, focusing on ease of installation and integration with existing network infrastructure, making it suitable for system administrators and technically inclined users seeking to enhance network privacy.
