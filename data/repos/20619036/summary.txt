Pi-hole is a DNS sinkhole solution designed for network administrators and privacy-conscious users to implement network-wide advertisement blocking. Built primarily with Shell scripts and leveraging dnsmasq as the core DNS server, it intercepts DNS queries and blocks requests to known advertising domains by returning null responses. The system targets the network infrastructure and cybersecurity domain, functioning as a lightweight DNS resolver that can optionally serve as a DHCP server. Pi-hole addresses the problem of pervasive online advertising and tracking by providing centralized filtering at the network level, eliminating the need for client-side ad-blocking software on individual devices. It's specifically designed for deployment on Linux systems, particularly Raspberry Pi hardware, and includes a web-based dashboard for monitoring and configuration management.
