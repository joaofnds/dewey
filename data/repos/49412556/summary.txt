Tantivy is a full-text search engine library, inspired by Apache Lucene, implemented in Rust. It provides core functionalities for full-text search, including configurable tokenization with stemming support for various languages, BM25 scoring, natural query language parsing, and phrase query search. The library features incremental and multithreaded indexing, fast startup times, and supports fast fields for various data types. This library is intended for developers building search-focused applications, providing a performant alternative to Elasticsearch or Apache Solr, and is typically used to build standalone search engine applications or integrated within larger systems.
