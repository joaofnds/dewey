Tantivy is a high-performance full-text search engine library written in Rust, designed as a Lucene-inspired foundation for building custom search applications. Targeting search infrastructure developers and systems engineers, it provides core search functionality including BM25 scoring, configurable tokenization with stemming support, incremental indexing, faceted search, and range queries. The library leverages Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics, implementing SIMD integer compression, multithreaded indexing, memory-mapped directories, and compressed document storage using LZ4/Zstd. Unlike standalone search servers such as Elasticsearch or Solr, Tantivy functions as a library crate for embedding search capabilities into custom applications, offering sub-10ms startup times ideal for command-line tools and requiring developers to build their own query interfaces and clustering solutions.
