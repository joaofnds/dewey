curl-to-Go is a browser-based JavaScript tool that converts curl HTTP commands into equivalent Go code, targeting web developers and API integration workflows. It parses curl command syntax including headers, authentication, request bodies, and common flags, then generates corresponding Go HTTP client code using Go's standard net/http package. The tool addresses the common developer need to translate API documentation examples (typically provided as curl commands) into Go implementation code, eliminating manual translation overhead. Designed for web developers working with REST APIs and HTTP services, it supports basic HTTP operations but doesn't guarantee complete flag coverage due to curl's extensive option set. The tool operates entirely client-side in the browser without requiring server-side processing or external dependencies.
