`curl-to-go` is a browser-based web application designed to convert `curl` commands into equivalent Go code snippets. It focuses on translating common HTTP commands, including headers, authentication, and body parameters. Implemented in JavaScript, this developer productivity tool facilitates rapid code generation for API interaction by taking curl command examples and producing functional Go code. The project's core functionality serves as a bridge, enabling developers to quickly translate and integrate curl-based API documentation examples into their Go projects, thereby enhancing developer workflow efficiency when interacting with HTTP APIs.
