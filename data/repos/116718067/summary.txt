Caire is a Go-based content-aware image resizing library that implements the seam carving algorithm for intelligent image scaling without distortion of important visual elements. Targeting computer vision and image processing applications, it uses edge detection (Sobel filters), dynamic programming, and optional face detection to identify and preserve critical image regions during resize operations. The library combines energy mapping, seam identification, and pixel removal/addition techniques to resize images both horizontally and vertically while maintaining visual coherence. Designed for developers working in media processing, web development, and computer vision domains, it provides both CLI tools and programmatic APIs with features like batch processing, multiple output formats, protective/removal masks, and GUI debugging capabilities for applications requiring intelligent image manipulation beyond traditional scaling methods.
