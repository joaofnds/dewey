`caire` is a Go library providing content-aware image resizing based on seam carving, capable of shrinking, enlarging, and square-cropping images while preserving important content. It implements edge detection and seam removal algorithms, optionally integrating face detection to prevent deformation of faces during resizing. This command-line tool and library offers features including GUI preview, support for various output image types, mask support, and concurrent processing of image directories.  It leverages the Pigo face detection library and targets developers and potentially users requiring automated image processing.
