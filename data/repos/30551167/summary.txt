ChrysaLisp is a 64-bit parallel operating system built from scratch in C++ for systems programming and distributed computing research. It targets OS developers, systems researchers, and low-level programmers working on MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) architectures. The system features a custom Virtual Processor (VP) for cross-platform portability across x86-64, ARM64, and RISC-V64, an object-oriented assembler, integrated Lisp interpreter, C-Script compiler, and complete GUI framework. It operates as a self-hosting environment with dynamic binding, supporting macOS, Linux, Windows, and Raspberry Pi platforms. The OS addresses parallel computing challenges through shared memory links and network topology simulation, providing a complete development toolchain for experimental parallel system development and computer science education.
