ChrysaLisp is a self-hosting, 64-bit operating system designed for parallel and distributed computing, featuring a GUI, terminal, object-oriented assembler, C-Script compiler, and a unique Lisp interpreter. Written in C++, it includes a Virtual Processor (VP) for cross-platform portability (x64, ARM64, RISC-V64) and a custom GUI system built using its object model. The system provides command-line tools, built-in build systems, and support for various network topologies, targeting developers seeking a comprehensive environment for OS research, experimentation with parallel computing, and low-level system programming on diverse hardware platforms, including Raspberry Pi.
