Typst is a Rust-based markup typesetting compiler designed as a modern alternative to LaTeX for document preparation and academic publishing. The system targets researchers, technical writers, and document authors who need professional-quality typesetting with mathematical notation, bibliography management, and complex layouts. Built with incremental compilation for fast rendering, Typst combines declarative markup syntax with an integrated scripting system for dynamic content generation. The compiler processes .typst files through a custom parser and layout engine, supporting advanced typography features like mathematical equations, tables, and configurable document styling through set/show rules. Unlike traditional LaTeX workflows, Typst emphasizes user-friendly syntax while maintaining the power needed for complex academic and technical documents, serving the scholarly publishing and professional documentation domains.
