This GitHub repository contains the Typst compiler, a markup-based typesetting system designed for both power and ease of use. It is primarily focused on typesetting documents, with built-in markup for common formatting tasks and flexible functions for more complex requirements. The system also includes a tightly integrated scripting system, math typesetting, bibliography management, and fast compile times due to incremental compilation. This repository is written in Rust and licensed under the Apache License 2.0. It targets users who require a powerful yet user-friendly typesetting solution for their documents. The Typst compiler allows local compilation of Typst documents, while the best writing experience is offered through the collaborative online editor available at [typst.app](https://typst.app/).
