libSQL is an open-source, embedded database system forked from SQLite, designed for both open contributions and enhanced functionality. It provides a drop-in replacement for SQLite with full API compatibility while incorporating features like embedded database replicas, a remote SQLite server, and WebAssembly user-defined functions. Primarily implemented in C and offering bindings for languages like Rust, JavaScript, and Python, libSQL supports various database extensions and modifications to the core SQLite API, including altering column types, randomized ROWID, and a virtual write-ahead log interface, positioning it as a versatile database solution targeted at developers and system integrators. The project also includes tooling for building and interacting with the database, including command-line interface utilities and a Docker integration.
