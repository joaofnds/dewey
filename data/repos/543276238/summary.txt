libSQL is an open-source fork of SQLite designed for modern application development, extending the embedded database with distributed capabilities and multi-language support. Built primarily in C with Rust integrations, it targets web developers and application architects who need SQLite's simplicity with enhanced features like embedded replicas, remote server access, and WebAssembly compatibility. The project addresses limitations of traditional SQLite by adding replication, server-mode operation similar to PostgreSQL/MySQL, and comprehensive language bindings for Rust, JavaScript, Python, and Go. It solves the problem of scaling embedded databases beyond single-node applications while maintaining SQLite's lightweight characteristics, making it suitable for edge computing, distributed applications, and modern web development workflows requiring both local and remote database access patterns.
