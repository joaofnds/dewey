dimmer.el is an Emacs Lisp package that provides visual buffer management for Emacs text editor users by dynamically dimming inactive buffers while highlighting the currently active buffer. Targeting software developers and Emacs power users, it implements a minor mode that non-destructively adjusts foreground and/or background colors of faces in inactive buffers by calculating muted versions of the existing color scheme. The package integrates with popular Emacs extensions like Helm, Magit, Company, Org-mode, and Which-key through dedicated configuration functions, and offers customizable dimming algorithms that work in different color spaces (RGB, HSV, LAB). It solves the common problem of visual buffer identification in multi-buffer workflows by providing automatic, theme-agnostic visual feedback without requiring manual face definitions.
