`dimmer.el` is an Emacs Lisp package providing a minor mode that visually highlights the active buffer by dimming the faces in inactive buffers, enhancing focus within the Emacs text editor environment. This package dynamically adjusts colors, supporting foreground, background, or both, while offering customization options such as adjusting the dimming intensity (`dimmer-fraction`), excluding specific buffers (`dimmer-buffer-exclusion-regexps`, `dimmer-buffer-exclusion-predicates`), and preventing dimming under certain conditions. Users can further configure the package for compatibility with other Emacs packages via convenience functions. It is an Emacs extension intended for Emacs users seeking improved visual organization within the editor.
