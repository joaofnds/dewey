The `felangel/bloc` repository is a comprehensive Dart state management library implementing the Business Logic Component (BLoC) design pattern for Flutter and AngularDart applications. It provides a predictable, reactive architecture for managing application state through event-driven programming and stream-based data flow. The monorepo contains nine specialized packages including core bloc functionality, Flutter widgets (`flutter_bloc`), AngularDart integration (`angular_bloc`), state persistence (`hydrated_bloc`), testing utilities (`bloc_test`), concurrency management (`bloc_concurrency`), and development tools. It addresses the complexity of state management in cross-platform mobile and web applications by enforcing separation of business logic from UI components through a unidirectional data flow pattern. The library targets Flutter and Dart developers building scalable applications requiring predictable state transitions, particularly in enterprise mobile development and complex user interface scenarios where traditional setState approaches become unmanageable.
