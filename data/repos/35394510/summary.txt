The tool targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and security professionals managing containerized infrastructure, providing automated security validation through both standalone script execution and containerized deployment options. It addresses the critical need for consistent Docker security posture assessment in production environments, offering detailed remediation guidance and customizable testing parameters for enterprise container security compliance.
