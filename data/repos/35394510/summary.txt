The `docker/docker-bench-security` repository provides a security auditing tool for Docker containers and hosts, automating checks against the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Docker Benchmark. Written in Shell script, it enables users to assess and enforce best practices for container deployment in production environments. Key functionalities include running automated security tests, generating logs, and offering options to filter and exclude specific checks based on ID or pattern matching within container/image names and labels. It is a standalone command-line utility designed for system administrators and DevOps engineers to improve the security posture of their Docker environments.
