**jsonui** is a command-line JSON exploration tool built in Go that provides an interactive terminal-based interface for navigating and analyzing JSON data structures. Targeting software developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators working with APIs, configuration files, and data processing pipelines, the tool accepts JSON input via standard input/piping and renders it as an expandable tree structure with vim-like navigation controls (j/k for movement, e for expand/collapse). It solves the common problem of examining large or complex JSON payloads in terminal environments without requiring external GUI applications or manual parsing, making it particularly valuable for debugging API responses, exploring configuration files, and analyzing structured data during development workflows. The tool integrates seamlessly into existing command-line toolchains and shell scripting environments.
