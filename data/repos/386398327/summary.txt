`org-roam-ui` is a TypeScript-based web application frontend designed for visualizing and interacting with notes managed by `org-roam`, an Emacs package for Zettelkasten note-taking. This project provides a graphical interface featuring interactive graph visualizations of org-roam notes, note previews, theme syncing with Emacs, and filter capabilities. Built using React and leveraging libraries like D3, it also allows for direct interaction with Emacs from the web UI via commands, offering features such as opening notes and following user movements. It is an Emacs plugin, intended for users of org-roam who want a graphical interface for exploring their notes.
