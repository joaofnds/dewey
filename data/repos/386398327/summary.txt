Org-roam-ui is a TypeScript-based web frontend that provides interactive graph visualization for org-roam Zettelkasten note-taking systems within the Emacs ecosystem. Built with React and D3.js, it serves as a graphical interface for exploring interconnected org-mode notes, replacing the legacy org-roam-server with enhanced functionality. The application runs as a local web server (port 35901) alongside Emacs, communicating via WebSocket for real-time synchronization of note updates and navigation. It targets knowledge workers, researchers, and Emacs users who employ org-roam for personal knowledge management (PKM), offering features like node zooming, local graph manipulation, theme synchronization, and bidirectional following between the web interface and Emacs buffers. The solution addresses the need for visual exploration of complex note relationships in text-based Zettelkasten systems.
