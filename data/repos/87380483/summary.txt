Async is a Ruby-based asynchronous I/O framework built on io-event that enables scalable, event-driven server applications and network programming. Targeting web developers and backend engineers, it solves Ruby's traditional blocking I/O limitations by providing fiber-based concurrency without callbacks, supporting thousands of concurrent clients per process. The framework serves the web development and network services domain, offering composable components for HTTP servers, WebSocket handling, DNS resolution, and real-time applications. Built around an event-driven reactor pattern with multi-thread/process containers, it integrates with Ruby's scheduler interface and provides debugging tools, timeouts, and worker pools for building high-performance concurrent applications like web servers, API services, and network daemons.
