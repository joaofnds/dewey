Olivetti is an Emacs Lisp minor mode that automatically manages window margins to create a centered text layout optimized for writing and prose composition. The package dynamically calculates and adjusts left and right window margins based on configurable text body width parameters (character count, window fraction, or fill-column), maintaining consistent readability across different window sizes. It integrates with Emacs' text-scale-mode for responsive scaling, offers customizable styling options including margin and fringe control, and maintains buffer-local state to allow simultaneous prose and code editing workflows. Targeting writers, technical authors, and developers who compose documentation within Emacs, Olivetti addresses the common problem of uncomfortable text reading in wide editor windows by implementing automatic margin balancing without affecting underlying buffer content or requiring external dependencies beyond Emacs 24.4.
