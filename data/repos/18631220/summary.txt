`rnkn/olivetti` is an Emacs minor mode designed to enhance the writing experience by automatically balancing window margins for improved text composition. It allows users to set a desired text body width, adjusting window margins dynamically, supporting character counts, fractions of the window width, and interaction with `fill-column`. Core functionalities include margin adjustment with various control keys, customizable margin styles using fringes, and optional recall of `visual-line-mode` state. Implemented in Emacs Lisp, this plugin targets Emacs users focused on prose writing.
