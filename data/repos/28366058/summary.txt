The `distribution/distribution` repository provides a Go-based toolkit for packing, shipping, storing, and delivering container content, specifically implementing the OCI Distribution Specification. Its core functionality centers on providing an open-source registry implementation, enabling users to store and distribute container images. Key components include a registry implementation and associated libraries for interacting with distribution components. This project is a library/toolset for registry operators and developers within the containerization ecosystem, allowing for the creation of secure and scalable container content distribution systems.
