The distribution/distribution repository is a Go-based open-source registry implementation that provides infrastructure for storing, managing, and distributing container images and OCI-compliant artifacts. Built for the DevOps and container orchestration domain, it implements the OCI Distribution Specification to enable HTTP-based push/pull operations for container registries. The toolkit serves as the foundational technology powering major container registries including Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, GitLab Container Registry, and CNCF Harbor. It provides both a complete registry server implementation and reusable Go libraries for building custom distribution solutions. The system primarily targets platform engineers, DevOps teams, and infrastructure administrators who need to deploy private container registries or integrate container distribution capabilities into larger systems, offering scalable storage backends and secure content delivery mechanisms for containerized applications.
