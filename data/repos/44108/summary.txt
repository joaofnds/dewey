LFE (Lisp Flavoured Erlang) is a Lisp syntax front-end compiler for the Erlang Virtual Machine that enables functional programming with Lisp semantics while maintaining full compatibility with standard Erlang code. Built entirely in Erlang, it targets distributed systems, concurrent programming, and fault-tolerant application development domains where Erlang/OTP excels. The project provides a complete toolchain including compiler (lfec), REPL, documentation generator (lfedoc), and script runner (lfescript), allowing developers to leverage Erlang's actor model concurrency and supervision trees using familiar Lisp syntax with s-expressions, macros, and functional programming constructs. It serves Lisp programmers who want to build scalable, fault-tolerant systems on the battle-tested Erlang/OTP platform for telecommunications, web backends, IoT, and real-time messaging applications.
