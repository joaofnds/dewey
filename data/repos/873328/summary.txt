Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and application performance monitoring (APM) platform built primarily with Python and Django, targeting web development and DevOps domains. It provides real-time crash reporting, error logging, Content Security Policy (CSP) violation tracking, and performance monitoring for production applications across multiple programming languages and frameworks. The platform aggregates, analyzes, and alerts on application errors and performance issues through extensive SDK support for JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, PHP, and mobile platforms. Sentry addresses the critical DevOps challenge of maintaining application reliability and debugging production issues by centralizing error data, providing contextual debugging information, and enabling rapid incident response for software development teams and site reliability engineers.
