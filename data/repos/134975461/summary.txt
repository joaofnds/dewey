ueberzug was a deprecated tool designed to inject image support into terminal emulators lacking built-in image rendering capabilities. It functioned by enabling image display within terminal applications that met specific requirements, providing a workaround before standardized image protocols were widely adopted. The project's core functionality revolves around manipulating terminal output to display images, effectively acting as a bridge between image data and the terminal's display. Given the context, it's likely a CLI tool or a library intended for developers or users interacting with terminal emulators.
