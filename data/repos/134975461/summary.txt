ueberzug was a terminal image display utility designed to inject image rendering capabilities into terminal emulators that lacked native image protocol support. Operating in the terminal/CLI tools domain, it served as a compatibility layer for displaying images in text-based environments by exploiting specific terminal emulator properties. The tool targeted developers, system administrators, and power users working with terminal-based applications who needed image display functionality before widespread adoption of standardized protocols like SIXEL or Kitty's image protocol. It functioned as a transitional solution for X11-based systems, providing a workaround for image rendering in terminals until proper image protocol standards became more prevalent, though it was incompatible with Wayland and has since been deprecated in favor of native terminal image protocol implementations.
