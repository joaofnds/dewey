`grpc-go` is the Go language implementation of gRPC, a high-performance, open-source RPC framework built upon HTTP/2. This library provides the tools for building distributed applications using remote procedure calls, enabling communication between services. Key functionalities include defining service contracts using Protocol Buffers (proto files), handling request routing, and managing connection lifecycles for efficient RPC execution. It is a Go library that targets Go developers building microservices and other networked applications, offering features for building and consuming gRPC services.
