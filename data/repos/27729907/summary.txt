grpc-go is the official Go language implementation of Google's gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) framework, providing a high-performance HTTP/2-based RPC system for building distributed systems and microservices architectures. This library enables Go developers to create strongly-typed client-server communication using Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for service definition and serialization, supporting features like streaming, authentication, load balancing, and connection management. Targeting backend developers and distributed systems engineers, it solves the problem of efficient inter-service communication in cloud-native applications, replacing traditional REST APIs with type-safe, schema-driven RPC calls. The implementation includes comprehensive tooling for code generation, connection handling, and integration with Go's ecosystem for building scalable microservices and API gateways.
