Solarized is a scientifically-designed 16-color palette optimized for developer tooling and terminal environments, featuring precise CIELAB lightness relationships and mathematically-derived hue selections. The project provides color scheme implementations across development environments including Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio, terminal emulators (iTerm2, Terminal.app, Xresources), and development tools like Mutt. Built primarily with Vim script configuration files, it addresses eye strain and readability issues in coding environments by offering carefully calibrated dark and light themes tested across various display conditions. The palette includes eight monotone colors and eight accent colors designed for syntax highlighting, UI elements, and text rendering. Target users are software developers, system administrators, and technical professionals who spend extensive time in code editors, terminals, and development IDEs requiring consistent, eye-friendly color schemes across their entire toolchain.
