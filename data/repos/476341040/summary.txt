`go-collections` is a Go library providing a collections package inspired by Laravel, designed for efficient slice and map manipulation. It offers generic functions and custom slice/map types with pipeable method chaining to facilitate common collection operations such as mapping, filtering, and sorting. The library's architecture centers around Go generics, avoiding external dependencies for resource-efficient processing, and includes specific collection types for slices and key-value (map) structures with methods like `Collect`, `Map`, `Each`, and sorting. This project is a Go library targeting developers seeking to enhance slice and map handling within their Go applications.
