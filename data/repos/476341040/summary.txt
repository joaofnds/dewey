`go-collections` is a Go library that provides functional programming utilities for slice and map manipulation, directly inspired by Laravel's Collections API. Built for Go developers working in web development and general application programming, it leverages Go's generics (type parameters) introduced in Go 1.18 to offer type-safe collection operations without external dependencies. The library addresses the historical lack of functional collection methods in Go by providing both standalone generic functions and chainable collection types that support operations like mapping, filtering, sorting, and aggregation. It offers three main approaches: generic functions for basic operations, slice collections for pipeable transformations, and KV collections for ordered map operations, targeting Go developers who want Laravel-style collection manipulation with the performance and type safety of Go's modern generics system.
