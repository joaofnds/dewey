This Ruby project animates the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function within a terminal environment. It visualizes the internal operations of SHA-256, including bitwise operations, rotational functions, and message block processing, using animated GIFs and terminal output. The application is implemented as a set of Ruby scripts, each demonstrating and animating a specific step within the SHA-256 algorithm, such as right shifts, rotations, and compression rounds. Designed primarily for educational purposes and demonstration, it allows users to hash input data and observe the function's computational steps.
