This Ruby-based educational tool provides an animated terminal visualization of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function algorithm. Targeting cryptography educators, security professionals, and developers learning hash functions, it demonstrates the complete SHA-256 process including bitwise operations (XOR, rotation, shifting), sigma functions, choice/majority functions, and the full hashing pipeline. The implementation breaks down complex cryptographic concepts into visual step-by-step animations, supporting various input formats (binary, hex, files) and including Bitcoin's double-SHA256 variant. Built entirely in Ruby with terminal-based ASCII animations, it serves as an interactive learning resource for understanding the internal mechanics of SHA-256, commonly used in blockchain, digital signatures, and data integrity verification systems.
