`fishdraw` is a JavaScript-based project that procedurally generates fish drawings for artistic and plotter applications. It outputs drawings as SVG, JSON, or CSV formats, with animated SVG generation capabilities.  The project is a standalone, single-file command-line application, allowing users to generate fish drawings with customizable parameters, including a seed string for fish naming and speed control for animations. Targeted for artists or users interested in generative art, it provides a programmatic means of producing unique visual outputs suitable for plotter art.
