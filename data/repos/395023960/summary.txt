fishdraw is a procedural generation tool that creates randomized fish illustrations using algorithmic drawing techniques, primarily targeting digital art and pen plotter applications. Built as a standalone JavaScript module with zero dependencies, it generates fish drawings as polyline data structures that can be exported to multiple vector formats including SVG, JSON, and CSV. The system employs parametric generation with seeding capabilities for reproducible results, automatic pseudo-Latin nomenclature generation, and SMIL-based animation export functionality. Designed for creative technologists, generative artists, and pen plotter enthusiasts, it addresses the need for automated vector art creation suitable for physical plotting devices. The tool functions both as a command-line utility and importable JavaScript library, making it accessible for integration into larger creative coding projects or standalone artistic workflows within the procedural art generation domain.
