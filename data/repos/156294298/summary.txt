Hexyl is a command-line hexadecimal viewer written in Rust designed for binary data analysis and inspection. Targeting system administrators, reverse engineers, security researchers, and developers working with binary files, it provides colored terminal output to visually distinguish different byte categories including NULL bytes, printable ASCII characters, ASCII whitespace, and non-ASCII data. The tool addresses the common need for readable hex dump analysis in DevOps, cybersecurity, and low-level programming workflows by replacing traditional hex viewers with enhanced visual formatting. Built with Rust for cross-platform compatibility, hexyl integrates into terminal-based development environments and supports standard package managers across Linux, macOS, Windows, and BSD systems, making binary file examination more accessible and efficient.
