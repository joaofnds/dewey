`hexyl` is a command-line application, a hex viewer, written in Rust, designed for inspecting binary data in the terminal. It provides a colored output for distinguishing byte categories (e.g., printable ASCII, whitespace, non-ASCII) making it easier to read and analyze binary files. Installation is supported via various package managers across multiple operating systems, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, macOS (Homebrew, MacPorts), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Termux, and Windows (via cargo, snap, scoop), facilitating broad adoption. This standalone CLI tool targets system administrators and developers needing to quickly examine raw data.
