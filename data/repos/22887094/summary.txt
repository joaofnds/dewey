Tesseract is a high-performance, open-source OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine written in C++, designed for extracting text from images. It implements both a legacy OCR engine and a modern neural net (LSTM) based engine focused on line recognition. The core functionality enables users to convert various image formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc.) into plain text, hOCR, PDF, and other output formats, supporting over 100 languages. This project provides both a command-line program and a C/C++ API (`libtesseract`) for developers to integrate OCR capabilities into their applications, with dependencies on Leptonica for image handling.
