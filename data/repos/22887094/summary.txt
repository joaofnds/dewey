Tesseract is an open-source OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine written in C++ that converts images containing text into machine-readable text formats. The library serves document processing, digitization, and text extraction applications across industries requiring automated text recognition from scanned documents, PDFs, and images. It implements both legacy pattern-matching algorithms and modern LSTM neural networks for line-based text recognition, supporting over 100 languages with Unicode UTF-8 encoding. The engine accepts various image formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF) and outputs multiple formats including plain text, hOCR, PDF, and ALTO. Target users include software developers, data scientists, and automation engineers building document processing pipelines, content management systems, and machine learning applications that require reliable text extraction from visual sources.
