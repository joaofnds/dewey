Debezium is a Java-based, open-source platform for change data capture (CDC), specifically designed for low-latency data streaming from various databases. It enables applications to consume row-level change events, providing features such as cache invalidation, simplification of monolithic applications, data integration, and support for CQRS architectures. Utilizing Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect, Debezium captures and streams database changes in a durable and fault-tolerant manner, with connectors available for diverse database management systems. This project functions as a framework and library, with a target audience of developers and data engineers building data pipelines and integrating database changes into other systems.
