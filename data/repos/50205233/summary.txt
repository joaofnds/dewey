Debezium is an open-source change data capture (CDC) platform built on Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect that monitors database changes in real-time and streams them as events. Targeting data engineering and distributed systems domains, it provides connectors for various databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.) to capture row-level changes and publish them to Kafka topics with guaranteed ordering and durability. The platform solves data synchronization, cache invalidation, and event-driven architecture challenges by eliminating the complexity of database-specific change monitoring approaches. Primary users include data engineers, backend developers, and system architects building data pipelines, microservices, or real-time analytics systems who need reliable, low-latency database change propagation across distributed applications.
