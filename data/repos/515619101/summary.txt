VHS is a Go-based CLI tool for programmatically generating terminal session recordings as GIFs through code-driven automation. Targeting the DevOps and developer tooling domain, it uses a declarative "tape" file format to script terminal interactions, keystrokes, and timing controls for creating reproducible CLI demonstrations and integration tests. The tool leverages ffmpeg for video processing and ttyd for terminal emulation, enabling developers to version-control their terminal recordings alongside documentation. VHS addresses the problem of maintaining up-to-date CLI tool demos and automated testing of command-line interfaces, serving software developers, DevOps engineers, and technical writers who need consistent, programmable terminal output visualization for documentation, tutorials, and CI/CD workflows.
