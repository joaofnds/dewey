`charmbracelet/vhs` is a Go-based command-line application designed to generate terminal GIFs from code, primarily for demoing and testing CLI tools. It allows users to define terminal interactions using a `.tape` file format with commands for typing, key presses, setting terminal appearance attributes (font, size, theme), and incorporating pauses. Key features include support for outputting GIFs, MP4, and WebM videos, along with options for publishing to a sharing service and an integrated SSH server. This is a developer productivity tool that utilizes `ttyd` and `ffmpeg` as dependencies and is intended for developers building or documenting command-line interfaces.
