asyncmachine-go is a Go-based control flow orchestration library that implements Actor Model and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) paradigms through a clock-based state machine architecture. Designed for distributed systems and workflow automation, it provides atomic state transitions, transparent RPC communication, and graph-structured concurrency management for complex backend applications. The library targets DevOps engineers and distributed systems developers building microservice orchestrators, background job processors, consensus systems, and real-time workflow engines. Key features include libp2p-pubsub integration, telemetry support, remote worker coordination, and a TUI debugger for state machine visualization. It addresses the challenge of managing complex asynchronous workflows and inter-service communication in distributed Go applications while providing fault-tolerant, rule-based state mutations and automatic context/goroutine lifecycle management.
