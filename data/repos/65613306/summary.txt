`muuntaja` is a Clojure library designed for efficient HTTP API format negotiation, encoding, and decoding. It provides standalone format handling and integrates with the Ring web framework via middleware and Pedestal-style interceptors. Key functionalities include supporting JSON, EDN, Transit (JSON & Msgpack), and optional support for MessagePack and YAML formats, along with features such as content type and charset negotiation based on HTTP headers, and configurable encoding/decoding options. The library is intended for use in Clojure-based web applications, specifically for handling data serialization and deserialization within API requests and responses, targeting developers building Clojure web services.
