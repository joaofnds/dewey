Muuntaja is a high-performance Clojure library for HTTP API format negotiation, encoding, and decoding in web development applications. It provides automatic content negotiation based on HTTP headers (Content-Type, Accept, Accept-Charset) and supports multiple serialization formats including JSON (via Jsonista), EDN, Transit (JSON/MessagePack), YAML, and MessagePack. The library integrates seamlessly with Ring middleware, Pedestal interceptors, and Reitit routing, offering up to 30x performance improvements over ring-middleware-format. It handles request body decoding and response body encoding automatically while providing extensible configuration for custom formats, character encoding, and serialization options. Designed for Clojure web developers building REST APIs and HTTP services, Muuntaja solves the common problem of managing multiple data formats and content negotiation in web applications with explicit configuration and typed exception handling for robust error management.
