Task is a cross-platform task runner and build automation tool written in Go that serves as a modern alternative to GNU Make for DevOps and software development workflows. It uses YAML-based Taskfiles instead of Makefiles to define build tasks, dependency management, and command execution pipelines. The tool targets developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who need to automate compilation, testing, deployment, and maintenance tasks across different environments. Task addresses the complexity and syntax limitations of traditional Make by providing a more intuitive configuration format, better cross-platform compatibility, and enhanced dependency resolution. It integrates into CI/CD pipelines and local development environments, supporting parallel task execution, variable interpolation, and conditional task running for streamlined build processes.
