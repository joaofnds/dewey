`pyenv/pyenv` is a standalone command-line tool for managing multiple Python versions on a single system, focusing on developer productivity. It allows users to globally select a Python version, specify project-specific versions, and override the version via environment variables. Built with shell scripts, it installs different Python versions independently, creates shims to intercept Python command invocations, and directs them to the chosen Python installation, thus enabling easy switching between Python environments without requiring changes to system Python installations.
