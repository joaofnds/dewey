pyenv is a Python version management tool built with shell scripts that enables developers to install, switch between, and manage multiple Python interpreter versions on Unix-like systems. Targeting Python developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators across web development, data science, and general software engineering domains, it solves the common problem of managing different Python versions for various projects without requiring Python itself as a dependency. The tool uses a shim-based approach that intercepts Python commands through PATH manipulation, allowing per-user global Python version setting, per-project version specification, and environment variable overrides. Originally forked from Ruby's rbenv, pyenv integrates with shell environments (bash, zsh, fish) and supports installation via package managers like Homebrew, providing a lightweight alternative to Python-dependent version managers while enabling seamless Python version switching for development and deployment workflows.
