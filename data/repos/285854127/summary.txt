`babashka/process` is a Clojure library providing functionalities for shelling out and spawning sub-processes, enabling interaction with the operating system and execution of external commands. Key features include `shell`, `process`, and `exec` functions, allowing for command execution, output redirection (including to strings, bytes, and files), environment variable manipulation, and piping of process outputs. This library supports both synchronous and asynchronous process control, offering utilities for stream processing and pipeline creation, and is particularly useful for developers working with Clojure, especially within the context of the Babashka runtime or JVM applications.
