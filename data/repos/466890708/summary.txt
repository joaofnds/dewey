FlashDB is an embeddable, in-memory key-value database implemented in pure Go, designed for applications requiring fast data access with Redis-compatible operations. It targets Go developers building applications that need lightweight, ACID-compliant data storage without external database dependencies. The system supports STRING, HASH, SET, and SORTED SET data structures with Redis-like commands (GET/SET, HGET/HSET, SADD/SREM, ZADD/ZREM), implements durable append-only file persistence, and provides transaction-based concurrency control with multiple readers and single writer semantics. Built using modular libraries for different data structures and an append-only log, FlashDB serves embedded systems, microservices, and applications in web development and distributed systems where developers need in-process database capabilities with optional disk persistence and TTL-based expiration.
