FlashDB is an embeddable, in-memory key-value database implemented in Go, designed to offer fast reads and writes with Redis-like command compatibility for data structures including SET, SORTED SET, HASH, and STRING. The library provides ACID-compliant transactions, durability through an append-only file, and data expiration (TTL) support. FlashDB features a simple API for easy embedding, facilitating its use as a lightweight, in-memory key-value store. It is intended as a library for developers looking to build simple ACID-compliant databases.
