Goldpinger is a Kubernetes network connectivity debugging and monitoring tool designed for DevOps and platform engineering teams. Built in Go with a JavaScript frontend, it deploys as a DaemonSet across Kubernetes cluster nodes to continuously test inter-node network connectivity through ping operations. The tool integrates with the Prometheus monitoring ecosystem, exposing metrics for network latency, packet loss, and connectivity failures that can be visualized in Grafana dashboards and configured for alerting via AlertManager. It provides both a web UI with visual network topology graphs and REST APIs for programmatic access, enabling system administrators and SRE teams to proactively identify networking issues, troubleshoot cluster connectivity problems, and monitor network performance degradation in Kubernetes environments.
