Goldpinger is a Kubernetes debugging tool designed to test and visualize network connectivity between nodes within a Kubernetes cluster. This standalone application, written in JavaScript, functions as a DaemonSet and exposes Prometheus metrics for monitoring cluster health, latency, and DNS resolution, enabling users to detect and troubleshoot connectivity issues. Key features include a web UI for visualizing network topology, an API defined by a Swagger specification, and integration with Grafana and Alert Manager for comprehensive monitoring and alerting. The project's architecture leverages Kubernetes primitives, Prometheus for metrics collection, and offers deployment via Helm, targeting Kubernetes administrators and operators.
