LAPACK is a Fortran library providing subroutines for numerical linear algebra, addressing common problems like solving linear equations, eigenvalue and eigenvector computations, matrix factorizations, and singular value decomposition. This library offers a comprehensive suite of linear algebra functionalities, including BLAS, CBLAS (C interface to BLAS), and LAPACKE (C interface to LAPACK), facilitating efficient matrix computations.  It is distributed with testing programs and interfaces for C users. LAPACK functions as a core scientific computing package, enabling researchers and engineers to solve complex linear algebra problems, and it is designed for integration into commercial and research software.
