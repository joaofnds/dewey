LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a reference implementation library written in Fortran that provides numerical linear algebra subroutines for scientific computing and high-performance computing applications. It solves fundamental mathematical problems including linear equation systems, matrix factorizations (LU, QR, Cholesky), eigenvalue and eigenvector computations, singular value decomposition (SVD), and least squares problems. Built on top of BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms), LAPACK targets computational scientists, researchers, engineers, and developers working in numerical analysis, machine learning, data science, and scientific simulation domains. The library includes C interfaces (LAPACKE and CBLAS) and supports multiple build systems (Make, CMake) for cross-platform deployment, serving as the foundational layer for numerous high-level mathematical software packages and scientific applications requiring robust linear algebra operations.
