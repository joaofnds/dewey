chaoskube is a chaos engineering tool for Kubernetes environments that implements automated fault injection by periodically terminating random pods within a cluster. Built in Go, it serves as a Kubernetes-native chaos monkey that helps DevOps engineers and SRE teams test system resilience and fault tolerance by introducing controlled failures. The tool provides sophisticated filtering capabilities through label selectors, namespace targeting, annotations, and time-based exclusions, allowing operators to precisely control which pods are subject to termination. It supports both dry-run and active modes, includes HTTP health endpoints for monitoring, and can be deployed via Helm charts or raw Kubernetes manifests with appropriate RBAC permissions. This addresses the critical need for proactive reliability testing in containerized microservices architectures where unexpected pod failures are common operational scenarios.
