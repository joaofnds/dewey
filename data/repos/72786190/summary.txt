`chaoskube` is a standalone Go application designed for chaos engineering within Kubernetes clusters. It periodically terminates random pods, enabling users to test system resilience against pod failures. Functionality includes filtering target pods based on namespaces, labels, annotations, pod names, and age, alongside options to exclude specific weekdays, times, and days of the year. It utilizes the Kubernetes API and integrates with Helm for deployment, and offers a health endpoint for monitoring. This project is a command-line tool intended for Kubernetes administrators and DevOps engineers.
