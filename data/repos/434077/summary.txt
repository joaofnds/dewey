`churn` is a Ruby library and command-line tool designed to analyze code churn within a project's version history. It calculates the frequency of changes to files, classes, and methods over time, providing metrics to identify areas of high code volatility. The core functionality involves parsing Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and partially SVN repositories to track changes and generate reports. Users can utilize the CLI or integrate the library directly into their Ruby projects, leveraging options for ignoring files, setting minimum churn counts, and specifying date ranges to analyze past churn history. This developer productivity tool assists in understanding code maintainability and evolution within a project.
