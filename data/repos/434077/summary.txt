**Churn** is a Ruby-based code analysis tool designed for software development teams to track and measure code churn metrics across version control systems including Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, and SVN. The tool analyzes file, class, and method-level changes over time by examining commit history and building cumulative churn statistics stored locally in ./tmp directories. It provides both CLI and Rake task interfaces with configurable filtering options for file extensions, paths, and date ranges, outputting results in text or YAML formats. Churn integrates into continuous integration workflows and development processes through git post-commit hooks, helping developers identify frequently modified code sections that may indicate design issues, technical debt, or areas requiring refactoring attention in Ruby projects.
