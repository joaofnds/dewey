`jsnes-web` is a React-based web UI for the JSNES JavaScript NES emulator, providing a browser-based interface for playing NES ROMs. This web application leverages `canvas` and `WebAudio` for rendering and sound emulation, allowing users to load and interact with NES game ROMs within a web browser. The project is built using JavaScript and includes a build process based on `yarn` for production deployments, with code formatting enforced by Prettier. It functions as a standalone web application designed for end-users interested in playing NES games.
