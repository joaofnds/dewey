`Nx` is an Elixir library providing multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) and numerical definitions for scientific and machine learning applications. It enables numerical computation using Elixir, integrating with Google's XLA compiler through `EXLA` and offering a LibTorch backend via `Torchx`. This library facilitates tensor manipulation and numerical processing, with examples and benchmarks available in the `EXLA` project, specifically targeting developers within the Elixir ecosystem involved in numerical computing and machine learning tasks, allowing them to leverage GPU acceleration for their calculations.
