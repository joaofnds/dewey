The `googlefonts/Inconsolata` repository is a font project focused on the development and distribution of the Inconsolata monospace font family, optimized for code listings. Built primarily using Glyphs, fontmake, and gftools (Python-based tools), the project allows for the creation and building of variable fonts with features such as ligatures (e.g., "Ligconsolata" variant) and supports GF Latin Pro glyph sets. The font's Rust-based `glyphstool` subdirectory offers utilities for manipulating Glyphs format masters, including drawing primitives. The project provides build instructions and source files for developers and designers to customize or build the fonts.
