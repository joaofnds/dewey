OmniAuth is a Ruby-based authentication middleware library built on Rack that standardizes multi-provider authentication for web applications. It enables Ruby web developers to integrate OAuth and other authentication protocols from multiple providers (Facebook, Twitter, LDAP, etc.) through a unified interface using pluggable strategy patterns. The library functions as Rack middleware, allowing seamless integration with Ruby web frameworks like Rails and Sinatra by handling authentication flows and returning standardized authentication hashes containing user data. OmniAuth solves the complexity of implementing disparate authentication systems by providing a black-box solution where developers redirect users to `/auth/:provider` endpoints and receive normalized user data via callbacks, making it essential infrastructure for Ruby web applications requiring social login or enterprise authentication integration.
