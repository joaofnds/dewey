OmniAuth is a Ruby library providing a standardized, flexible system for multi-provider authentication in web applications. It allows developers to create authentication strategies for various services, from Facebook to LDAP, acting as Rack middleware to handle user authentication flows. Key functionalities include redirecting users to authentication providers and setting an authentication hash containing user information in the Rack environment. This library is a Ruby gem, designed to be integrated into web applications and provides an abstract layer for authentication, thereby supporting integration with different authentication providers.
