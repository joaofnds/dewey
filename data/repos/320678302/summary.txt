Microfts is a lightweight full-text search engine written in Go that implements trigram-based indexing using a Generalized Inverted Index (GIN) architecture. It leverages LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database) as an embedded NoSQL key-value storage backend for fast, space-efficient text indexing and retrieval. The tool targets developers and system administrators who need to implement fast full-text search capabilities for document collections, file systems, or text-heavy applications without deploying heavyweight search infrastructure like Elasticsearch. It provides command-line operations for creating databases, indexing files, performing text searches, and managing indexed content with approximately 2x storage overhead compared to source files. The system is optimized for collections of small documents and supports features like incremental updates, space reclamation, and regular expression filtering for search results.
