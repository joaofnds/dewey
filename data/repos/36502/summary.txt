This repository contains the source code for Git, a distributed version control system implemented primarily in C with shell scripting components. Git serves the software development domain across all industries, providing developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators with tools for tracking code changes, managing collaborative development workflows, and maintaining project history. The system implements a distributed architecture where each repository contains complete project history, enabling offline work and decentralized collaboration. Git solves fundamental problems in software development including code versioning, branch management, merge conflict resolution, and distributed team coordination. The codebase provides both high-level porcelain commands for everyday use and low-level plumbing commands for advanced repository manipulation, making it essential infrastructure for modern software development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
