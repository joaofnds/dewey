This repository contains the Java source code examples from the book "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests." Its primary function is to serve as a practical demonstration and learning resource for applying test-driven development (TDD) principles to object-oriented software design. The code, written in Java, illustrates how to build software iteratively through the use of unit tests. It functions as an educational example project, providing concrete implementations for the book's concepts.
