This repository contains the complete source code examples from "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests," a seminal book on test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance testing practices. Written in Java, the codebase demonstrates practical implementation of TDD methodologies, mock object patterns, and continuous testing workflows for object-oriented software development. The code focuses on building maintainable, well-tested Java applications using frameworks like JUnit for unit testing and mock frameworks for dependency isolation. It serves as a comprehensive reference implementation for software developers and technical leads seeking to master test-first development approaches, refactoring techniques, and automated testing strategies in enterprise Java environments. The examples illustrate real-world scenarios of evolving codebases through iterative testing cycles.
