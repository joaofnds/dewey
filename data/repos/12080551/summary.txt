Vegeta is a high-performance HTTP load testing tool and library written in Go, designed for performance testing and benchmarking web services and APIs. It targets DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers, and backend developers who need to conduct stress testing and capacity planning for HTTP-based systems. The tool generates configurable request rates to simulate realistic load patterns while avoiding coordinated omission problems common in load testing. It provides both a command-line interface with UNIX-style composability and a Go library for programmatic integration, supporting features like distributed testing, extensive reporting, HTTP/2, TLS, and various output formats. Vegeta addresses the critical need for accurate performance measurement in web service development, enabling teams to identify bottlenecks, validate scalability, and ensure system reliability under production-like traffic conditions.
