GitHub Readme Stats is a serverless JavaScript application that dynamically generates SVG-based statistical visualizations for GitHub profiles, designed for the developer tools and documentation domain. Built on Node.js and deployed on Vercel, it leverages the GitHub API to fetch user data and programmatically renders customizable cards displaying commit statistics, repository metrics, top programming languages, and repository pins. The service addresses the need for developers to showcase their GitHub activity and coding proficiency directly within README files through embedded images, eliminating manual statistics tracking. Target users are software developers, open-source contributors, and technical professionals seeking to enhance their GitHub profiles with real-time, visually appealing metrics that automatically update as their repository activity changes, supporting extensive theming and configuration options.
