Photopea is a browser-based raster and vector graphics editor that provides comprehensive file format support for professional design workflows. The platform primarily serves graphic designers, web developers, and digital content creators who need to edit complex graphics files including Adobe PSD, Illustrator AI, Sketch, XD, Figma, and InDesign formats without requiring desktop software installations. Built as a web application, it handles advanced image processing tasks including layer manipulation, vector editing, and RAW photo processing across 40+ file formats including modern formats like AVIF, HEIC, and JXL. The editor addresses cross-platform compatibility challenges in design workflows, particularly enabling Sketch file editing outside macOS environments and providing Photoshop-equivalent functionality on Chromebooks and low-power devices through browser-based rendering and processing.
