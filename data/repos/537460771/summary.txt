This repository implements a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server for the Fennel programming language, written in Rust. It targets Lisp/functional programming developers who use Fennel, particularly those working with Neovim and game development frameworks like LÃ–VE 2D where Fennel compiles to Lua. The server provides essential IDE features including diagnostics, goto definition, code completion, references, hover documentation, and symbol renaming through the standardized LSP specification. Built as a standalone Rust binary installable via Cargo, it integrates with LSP-compatible editors like Neovim through nvim-lspconfig, enabling modern development tooling for Fennel codebases without requiring a Fennel runtime environment. The project addresses the lack of robust language server support for Fennel developers seeking IntelliSense-like functionality in their preferred editors.
