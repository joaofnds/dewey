Keebfolio is a curated open-source repository that serves as a comprehensive resource catalog for the mechanical keyboard enthusiast and maker community. Built with Astro static site generator and deployed on Netlify, it systematically organizes mechanical keyboard projects across categories including staggered, ortholinear, and split keyboard layouts, along with firmware solutions (particularly QMK), PCB designs, 3D-printing resources, and development tools. The repository addresses the fragmented nature of mechanical keyboard project discovery by providing a centralized, community-maintained index of open-source keyboard hardware designs, firmware configurations, tutorials, and related tooling. It primarily targets keyboard enthusiasts, hardware makers, PCB designers, and developers working with embedded systems who need access to mechanical keyboard design resources, QMK firmware examples, and community-driven hardware projects for custom keyboard builds.
