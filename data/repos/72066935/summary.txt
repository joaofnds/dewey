gdbgui is a browser-based frontend for the GNU Debugger (gdb) that modernizes command-line debugging workflows for systems programming and software development. Built with TypeScript, React.js, and WebSocket communication, it provides a graphical web interface for debugging compiled languages including C, C++, Go, Rust, and Fortran. The tool bridges the gap between traditional terminal-based gdb debugging and modern IDE experiences by offering visual breakpoint management, stack frame inspection, memory visualization, and variable monitoring through a web browser. Packaged as a Python application, gdbgui targets systems programmers, embedded developers, and software engineers who need advanced debugging capabilities without heavyweight IDE dependencies, particularly useful for remote debugging scenarios and cross-platform development environments.
