`gdbgui` is a browser-based graphical user interface (GUI) frontend for the GNU Debugger (gdb), designed to enhance the debugging experience for C, C++, Go, Rust, and Fortran code. It enables users to interact with gdb through a web interface, allowing them to set breakpoints, view the call stack, and visualize data structures. Built with ReactJS and using WebSockets for communication, this standalone application facilitates debugging directly from a web browser, making it a developer productivity tool.
