Cal.com is an open-source scheduling infrastructure platform built with TypeScript and Next.js, serving as a self-hosted alternative to Calendly. The application leverages the T3 stack including tRPC for type-safe APIs, Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for data persistence, NextAuth for authentication, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Built using Turborepo for monorepo management and Zod for schema validation, it provides developers and organizations with white-label appointment scheduling capabilities with full data ownership and customization control. The platform targets web developers and businesses requiring booking management solutions, offering API-driven architecture for integration into existing systems while maintaining complete control over scheduling workflows, user data, and interface appearance.
