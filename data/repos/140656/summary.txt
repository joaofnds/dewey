`tig` is a standalone, text-mode interface (TUI) application for Git, providing a visual and interactive means of navigating and interacting with Git repositories. Built in C and leveraging the ncurses library, it offers features for viewing commit history, branches, diffs, and other Git-related information directly within a terminal environment. This developer productivity tool provides an alternative to the standard Git command-line interface, enhancing the user experience for Git operations.
