Tig is a text-mode interface for Git built in C using the ncurses library, primarily targeting software developers and DevOps professionals working in terminal environments. It functions as a Git repository browser that provides an interactive terminal user interface (TUI) for navigating Git history, viewing commits, diffs, and repository status without requiring a graphical environment. The tool addresses the need for efficient Git repository exploration and staging operations directly from the command line, serving as both a pager for Git command output and an interactive staging tool for chunk-level commit preparation. Tig is particularly valuable for developers who prefer terminal-based workflows, remote server administration, and environments where GUI Git clients are unavailable or impractical.
