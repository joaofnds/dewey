AllegroServe is a full-featured HTTP/1.1 compliant web server implemented in Common Lisp, targeting web developers and Lisp application developers who need embedded web capabilities. The framework provides comprehensive web infrastructure including static/dynamic content serving, HTML generation facilities, HTTP client functions, SSL/TLS support, web proxy with caching, CGI execution, and virtual hosting. It serves dual purposes: as a standalone web server for traditional web applications and as an embeddable module for adding web-based user interfaces to existing Lisp applications. The system includes advanced features like on-the-fly compression, chunked transfer encoding, access control mechanisms, and a publish function for dynamic page generation with caching. AllegroServe addresses the web development needs within the Common Lisp ecosystem, offering both server and client-side HTTP functionality with enterprise-grade features like SSL security and comprehensive testing suites.
