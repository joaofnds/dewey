`cl-arrows` is a Common Lisp library providing threading macros mirroring Clojure's `->` and `->>` and incorporating functionality from the `swiss-arrows` library, namely `-<>` and `-<>>`. This library enables functional-style data transformations by inserting an initial form into subsequent forms as either the first or last argument, or substituting placeholders (`<>`) for the result of the previous form. The project is a library intended for use in Common Lisp projects requiring concise and readable data manipulation pipelines, facilitating a more fluent programming style.
