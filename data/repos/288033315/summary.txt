This repository contains configuration files, specifically dotfiles, written in Emacs Lisp, likely for customizing an Emacs editor environment. It showcases keyboard layout customizations for the Sweep keyboard project, including visual representations of default, symbol, and number layers. The dotfiles define custom key combinations (combos) for common tasks like generating parentheses, tabs, and single quotes. This project is a configuration set, aimed at Emacs users seeking to tailor their editor and keyboard input methods.
