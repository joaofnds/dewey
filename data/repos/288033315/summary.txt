This repository contains a personal dotfiles configuration focused on a custom keyboard setup using the Sweep keyboard project, a compact ergonomic mechanical keyboard design. The configuration is implemented primarily in Emacs Lisp, indicating deep integration with the Emacs text editor ecosystem. The setup features a layered keyboard layout with default, symbol, and number layers, along with custom key combinations (combos) for efficient text input including parentheses, tab, and quote characters. This configuration targets software developers and power users who prioritize ergonomic typing, customizable workflows, and Emacs-based development environments. The technical implementation addresses the problem of RSI prevention and typing efficiency through reduced hand movement and personalized key mappings, particularly beneficial for programmers who spend extensive time coding and text editing.
