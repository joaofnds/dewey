`cl-imagemagick` is a Common Lisp library providing a wrapper for the ImageMagick image processing libraries. It enables programmatic access to ImageMagick's functionality, including image creation, editing, and composition, leveraging both the MagickCore and MagickWand APIs. The project utilizes C bindings generated with SWIG to interface with the ImageMagick libraries, offering features like platform-specific pre-generated foreign-function definitions. This library is a developer tool, specifically targeting Common Lisp developers who need to integrate image manipulation capabilities into their applications.
