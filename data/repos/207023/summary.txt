cl-imagemagick is a Common Lisp Foreign Function Interface (FFI) wrapper for ImageMagick's MagickWand and MagickCore APIs, targeting image processing and manipulation in Lisp-based applications. Built using SWIG to generate foreign function bindings, it enables programmatic access to ImageMagick's bitmap image creation, editing, and composition capabilities from within Allegro Common Lisp environments. The library serves web development and graphics processing domains, particularly for developers building image processing services or web applications requiring server-side image manipulation. It includes a demonstration web server for thumbnail generation, supporting both Linux and Windows platforms with ImageMagick 6.x dependencies, and addresses the need for robust image processing capabilities in Common Lisp applications without requiring command-line tool invocation.
