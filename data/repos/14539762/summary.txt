Projectile Rails is an Emacs Lisp minor mode that provides Ruby on Rails development tooling within GNU Emacs, built on top of the Projectile project management framework. It targets web developers working on Rails applications and engines, offering Rails-specific navigation capabilities including jumping between MVC components (models, views, controllers), helpers, and templates. The package integrates Rails command-line tools (rake, rails console, rails server, rails generate) directly into the Emacs environment and supports Rails development accelerators like Zeus and Spring preloaders. Key features include file navigation using Projectile's completion system, syntax highlighting for Rails keywords, automatic snippet insertion via YASnippet integration, and log file monitoring with auto-revert functionality. This tool serves as a comprehensive Rails IDE replacement for rinari, enabling Rails developers to maintain their Emacs-based workflow while accessing framework-specific productivity features.
