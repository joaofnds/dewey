`projectile-rails` is an Emacs mode that extends the `projectile` project management library, specifically tailored for Ruby on Rails application development. It provides a suite of commands to navigate Rails project resources, including controllers, views, models, and tests, utilizing `projectile`'s completion system for efficient file discovery. The mode integrates with tools like `rake`, `rails console`, `zeus`, and `spring`, facilitating common development tasks such as running tests, managing the Rails server, and executing console commands. Implemented in Emacs Lisp, it leverages `projectile`'s existing functionality to offer features like file searching and project management within the Emacs environment, aiming to enhance the productivity of Rails developers.
