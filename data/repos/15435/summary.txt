Liquid is a secure, customer-facing template engine written in Ruby designed for web application development where end-users need to edit templates without executing arbitrary code on servers. It provides a stateless templating system with separate compilation and rendering phases, featuring HTML-like syntax with variable interpolation (`{{ }}`) and control flow tags (`{% %}`). The engine targets web developers building multi-tenant applications, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems where template security is critical. Liquid implements scoped environments for encapsulating custom tags and filters, multiple error modes for development versus production use, and supports both HTML and email template rendering. Originally developed by Shopify, it solves the problem of allowing untrusted users to customize application appearance while maintaining server security and performance through compiled template caching.
