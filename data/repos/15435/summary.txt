`Liquid` is a Ruby-based template engine designed for secure, customer-facing web applications, particularly within the e-commerce domain. It provides a simple, non-evaluating, and stateless markup language enabling users to customize application appearance without allowing execution of potentially insecure code. Key features include a straightforward API for parsing and rendering templates, support for scoped environments to encapsulate custom tags and filters, and strict error modes for improved template validation. This library is intended for use as a core component for templating functionality, allowing developers to integrate dynamic content generation into web applications and HTML emails.
