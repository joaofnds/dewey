PEV2 is a PostgreSQL execution plan visualization tool built as a Vue.js component in TypeScript, designed for database administrators and developers working with PostgreSQL query optimization. It transforms PostgreSQL EXPLAIN output into interactive graphical visualizations, making complex query execution plans easier to analyze and understand. The tool operates in the database performance tuning domain, offering deployment options including a standalone HTML file, web service at explain.dalibo.com, and embeddable Vue.js component for integration into existing web applications. It utilizes Bootstrap for styling and supports both JSON and text-based PostgreSQL explain plan formats, serving as a modern rewrite of the original Postgres Explain Visualizer to help database professionals optimize query performance through visual plan analysis.
