Upspin is an experimental Go-based framework for creating a secure, global naming system that provides uniform access to files and data across distributed storage services. Built for systems programming and distributed infrastructure domains, it implements end-to-end cryptography, FUSE filesystem integration, and protocols for joining various storage backends into a unified namespace. The framework addresses the problem of secure, decentralized file sharing and naming across heterogeneous storage systems without being a traditional filesystem itself. Target users are systems engineers, infrastructure developers, and researchers working on distributed systems who need secure, uniform access patterns across multiple storage services. The project emphasizes security and uniformity over performance, implementing automatic snapshots and cryptographic protection for cross-platform data access.
