Upspin is a framework, implemented in Go, designed for secure and uniform naming and sharing of files and data globally. It provides protocols and reference implementations to integrate with storage services and file systems, offering end-to-end encryption. Key features include a global namespace, automatic nightly snapshots, and integration via `upspinfs`. The project's architecture emphasizes uniformity and security over performance and targets developers interested in secure data sharing and storage solutions, evidenced by its use of cryptography and a focus on a global name system.
