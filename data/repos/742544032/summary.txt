This repository provides a Python-based text clustering pipeline designed for data scientists and NLP practitioners working with large text datasets. Built on scikit-learn, UMAP, sentence-transformers, and FAISS, it implements a complete workflow for embedding generation, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and semantic labeling of text corpora. The system addresses the challenge of automatically organizing and categorizing unstructured text data by combining transformer-based embeddings with unsupervised clustering algorithms, then generating human-readable cluster summaries. Primary use cases include content analysis, dataset exploration, and automated text categorization for machine learning workflows. The pipeline integrates with Hugging Face datasets and includes visualization capabilities through matplotlib and plotly, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis and production text processing tasks in data science environments.
