**Text Clustering Repository** - A Python-based toolkit for efficiently embedding, clustering, and semantically labeling text datasets. This repository leverages existing standard methods to create a robust pipeline that can be customized and run on consumer laptops in minutes. The Text Clustering pipeline utilizes libraries such as scikit-learn, umap-learn, sentence_transformers, faiss-cpu, plotly, matplotlib, and datasets. This project is particularly useful for vector embedding and clustering tasks within the Machine Learning domain. The repository includes a text clustering pipeline, examples, and scripts to run, load, or infer on new texts from an input dataset. Users can customize the plotting further by modifying the `_show_mpl` and `_show_plotly` methods. This project is licensed under Apache License 2.0.
