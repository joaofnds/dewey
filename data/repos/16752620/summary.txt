Gogs is a self-hosted Git service written in Go that provides a lightweight alternative to GitHub Enterprise for organizations requiring private Git repository management. Targeting DevOps teams and system administrators, it offers complete Git hosting functionality including repository management, user authentication, pull requests, issues tracking, and webhook integrations. The application supports multiple database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3), various authentication methods (LDAP, SMTP, reverse proxy), and deployment options including Docker containers and ARM-based systems like Raspberry Pi. Gogs solves the problem of expensive Git hosting solutions by providing a minimal-resource, self-contained binary that can run on modest hardware while delivering essential Git collaboration features for development teams needing private repository hosting with full administrative control.
