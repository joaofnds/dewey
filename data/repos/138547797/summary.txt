mkcert is a zero-configuration command-line tool written in Go that creates locally-trusted TLS/SSL certificates for development environments. It automates the creation and installation of a local Certificate Authority (CA) into system trust stores across macOS, Windows, and Linux, then generates certificates for specified domains including localhost, wildcard domains, and IP addresses. The tool integrates with major browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and system certificate stores, eliminating HTTPS trust warnings during local development without requiring complex OpenSSL commands or manual CA management. Targeted at web developers and DevOps engineers, mkcert solves the common problem of establishing secure HTTPS connections for local development servers, supporting multiple certificate formats (PEM, PKCS#12) and client authentication certificates for comprehensive SSL/TLS testing scenarios.
