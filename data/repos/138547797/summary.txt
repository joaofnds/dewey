`mkcert` is a Go-based command-line utility designed to simplify the creation of locally-trusted development certificates for secure HTTPS connections. It automatically generates and installs a local Certificate Authority (CA) in the system trust store, supporting macOS, Linux, and Windows, as well as browsers like Firefox and Chrome. Functionality includes generating certificates for specified domains, wildcard domains, and email addresses, with options for client authentication and PKCS#12 file generation.  This standalone application is aimed at developers, streamlining local HTTPS development by eliminating the need for manual CA management or the use of untrusted self-signed certificates.
