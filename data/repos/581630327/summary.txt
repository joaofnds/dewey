`mini-lsm` is a Rust-based educational project and tutorial for building a key-value store database using the Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) data structure. It provides a comprehensive course structure spanning three weeks, covering core database concepts including Memtables, Sorted String Tables (SSTs), compaction strategies (leveled and tiered), Write-Ahead Logs (WAL), and Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC). This project offers both starter code and reference implementations, including a command-line interface (CLI) and a compaction simulator, facilitating hands-on learning and experimentation with storage engine design. It is an example/tutorial project aimed at software engineers and students interested in database internals and storage systems.
