Mini-LSM is an educational Rust-based implementation of an LSM-Tree (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) storage engine designed for database systems and key-value stores. This repository provides a structured 3-week course for building a complete storage engine from scratch, covering core database internals including memtables, sorted string tables (SSTs), block encoding, compaction strategies (leveled, tiered, simple), write-ahead logging (WAL), and multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) with snapshot isolation. The project targets systems programmers, database engineers, and students learning distributed systems fundamentals, offering hands-on experience with production database concepts used in systems like RocksDB and LevelDB. It includes reference implementations, CLI tools, compaction simulators, and comprehensive documentation to guide learners through implementing a functional storage engine with batch writes, bloom filters, and transaction support.
