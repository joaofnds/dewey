Scenic is a client application UI framework built on the Elixir/Erlang/OTP stack for developing cross-platform graphical applications targeting IoT and embedded systems. It provides a 2D retained-mode graphics library using OpenGL for rendering, designed specifically for fixed-screen connected devices running on Linux, MacOS, and Nerves platforms. The framework leverages OTP supervision trees for fault-tolerant application architecture and uses transform matrices for flexible UI positioning and scaling. Scenic addresses the need for self-contained, lightweight GUI applications in embedded and IoT domains where web browsers are impractical, enabling Elixir developers to build native graphical interfaces without HTML/JavaScript dependencies while maintaining the reliability and concurrency benefits of the BEAM virtual machine.
