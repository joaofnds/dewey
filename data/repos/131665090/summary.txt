Scenic is an Elixir library and framework designed for building cross-platform client applications, particularly targeting fixed-screen connected devices like IoT and also portable applications. It leverages the Erlang/OTP stack and OpenGL for fault-tolerant and performant applications across various operating systems. Key functionalities include a retained-mode 2D UI system, offering features like reusable UI components, flexible positioning with transform matrices, and remote access capabilities. This framework provides a secure and self-contained environment, avoiding browser dependencies and 3D rendering, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.
