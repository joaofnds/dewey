Gitako is a cross-browser extension built in TypeScript that enhances GitHub's web interface by adding a persistent file tree sidebar for repository navigation. Targeting web developers and software engineers who frequently browse GitHub repositories, it addresses the inefficiency of GitHub's native file exploration by providing instant file search, keyboard navigation, and hierarchical folder views. The extension supports multiple Git hosting platforms including GitHub Enterprise, Gitea, and Gitee, and integrates seamlessly with pull request workflows. Built as a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, it leverages GitHub's API to render file structures with features like syntax highlighting, code folding, and snippet copying, significantly improving developer productivity during code review and repository exploration tasks.
