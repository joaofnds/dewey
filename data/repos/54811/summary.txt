The fnando/recurrence library is a Ruby gem designed for handling recurring events in web applications and calendar systems. It provides a declarative API for defining complex temporal patterns including daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly recurrences with support for intervals, repetition limits, weekday constraints, and date boundaries. The library targets Ruby developers building scheduling, calendar, or event management features in web applications, offering functionality to generate event collections, iterate through occurrences, validate date inclusion, and handle edge cases like month-end date shifting. Key features include flexible recurrence rule definition, date range constraints (starts/until/through), exception handling, and enumerable interfaces for event iteration, making it suitable for applications requiring sophisticated recurring event logic without external dependencies.
