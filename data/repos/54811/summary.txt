`recurrence` is a Ruby library designed for handling recurring events. It provides a flexible API for defining recurring schedules, supporting daily, weekly, monthly (by date or weekday), and yearly recurrence patterns. Users can specify intervals, repetition counts, start and end dates, and exceptions, generating a collection of event dates or iterating through them. It is implemented as a library for Ruby developers needing to manage event scheduling within their applications.
