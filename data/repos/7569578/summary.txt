Discourse is an open-source community forum platform built on Ruby on Rails backend with Ember.js frontend, targeting community managers and organizations needing modern discussion software. The platform uses PostgreSQL for data persistence and Redis for caching, providing threaded discussions, real-time chat, user management, and moderation tools. It addresses the web development and community management domain by replacing traditional forum software with a responsive, API-driven architecture that supports plugins, themes, and integrations. The system is designed for self-hosting or managed deployment, serving communities ranging from small groups to large-scale enterprise forums. Primary users include developers, community managers, and organizations requiring customizable discussion platforms with modern web standards and mobile responsiveness.
