TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is a configuration file format specification designed for software configuration management across DevOps, web development, and application deployment domains. It provides a human-readable alternative to JSON, YAML, and INI files by mapping unambiguously to hash tables while maintaining simplicity and readability through support for comments, nested structures, and native data types including strings, integers, floats, booleans, dates, arrays, and tables. The specification targets developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who need a standardized, language-agnostic configuration format that balances human readability with machine parseability, solving the problem of configuration file complexity while avoiding YAML's ambiguity and JSON's lack of comments.
