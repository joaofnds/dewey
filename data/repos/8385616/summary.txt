The `toml-lang/toml` repository defines the specification for TOML, Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language, a configuration file format. TOML aims to be a human-readable and unambiguous format, mapping directly to a hash table and designed to be easily parsed across various programming languages. This specification project includes an example, comparisons to related formats like JSON, YAML, and INI, and links to documentation and community resources such as a wiki cataloging implementations and related tools. It is a specification document rather than an implementation and is targeted towards developers and implementers of configuration file parsers and generators.
