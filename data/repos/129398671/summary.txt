`gitbase-web` is a web client application, written in Go, designed to query Git repositories using SQL. It leverages the `gitbase` engine to execute SQL queries against Git history and the Universal AST of code. The application allows users to interactively explore Git data through a web interface, facilitating analysis of code repositories and their history. It relies on a MySQL database connection for Gitbase data and a bblfsh server for UAST retrieval, and can be deployed using Docker Compose or as a standalone binary.
