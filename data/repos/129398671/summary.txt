Gitbase Web is a Go-based web application that provides a SQL query interface for analyzing Git repositories and source code. Built for the DevOps and software analytics domain, it serves as a frontend client for gitbase (a SQL interface to Git repositories) and integrates with bblfsh for Universal Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST) analysis. The application enables developers, engineering managers, and data analysts to perform complex SQL queries against Git history, commit data, and code structure across multiple repositories. It supports Docker deployment, connects to MySQL-compatible gitbase servers, and provides configurable query limits and connection management. The tool addresses the need for data-driven software development insights by making Git repository data accessible through familiar SQL syntax rather than complex Git commands or custom scripts.
