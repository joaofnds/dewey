vim-fireplace is a Vim plugin that provides seamless Clojure REPL integration for functional programming development. It connects to nREPL servers automatically through Leiningen, Boot, or Clojure CLI toolchains, enabling code evaluation, namespace management, and interactive development without leaving the editor. The plugin offers buffer-based evaluation commands, navigation features for symbol lookup and source jumping, macro expansion capabilities, and omnicomplete integration. It supports ClojureScript through Piggieback and integrates with cider-nrepl middleware for enhanced functionality. Key features include transparent nREPL connection management, quasi-REPL command-line windows, test running with quickfix integration, and enhanced Vim built-ins like `gf` for namespace navigation. This tool targets Clojure developers seeking efficient REPL-driven development workflows within Vim, eliminating context switching between editor and REPL environments while maintaining the editor's native interface paradigms.
