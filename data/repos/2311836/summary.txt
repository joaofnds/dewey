Evil Numbers is an Emacs Lisp package that provides numeric literal manipulation functionality for Emacs text editor users, particularly those using the Evil mode (Vim emulation). The package implements increment and decrement operations on binary (0b/0B), octal (0o/0O), decimal, and hexadecimal (0x/0X) number literals, mimicking Vim's Ctrl-A/Ctrl-X behavior with enhanced features like zero-padding preservation and region-based batch operations. It serves software developers and programmers who work with numeric constants in source code across various programming languages, offering cursor-based number detection and modification capabilities that streamline code editing workflows. The tool integrates seamlessly with Emacs keybinding systems and Evil mode, targeting developers who prefer Vim-style editing patterns within the Emacs ecosystem for efficient numeric literal manipulation during coding sessions.
