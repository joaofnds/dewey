ast-grep is a Rust-based CLI tool that performs structural code search, linting, and refactoring using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) instead of text-based pattern matching. Built on tree-sitter parsing technology, it enables developers to search and transform code across multiple languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc.) using intuitive code-like patterns with wildcard variables. The tool targets software developers working in web development, particularly those handling large-scale codebases requiring automated refactoring, code reviews, and static analysis. It addresses the limitations of traditional grep by understanding code structure, making it ideal for complex codemod operations, implementing custom linting rules via YAML configuration, and performing semantic code transformations that preserve syntactic correctness across entire projects.
