`ast-grep` is a command-line tool written in Rust for code structural search, linting, and rewriting, operating within the domain of software development tooling. It enables users to find and modify code based on its abstract syntax tree (AST), utilizing patterns resembling standard code to match AST nodes. Key functionalities include code search, linting, refactoring, and the ability to define rules via YAML configuration, making it suitable for static analysis and large-scale code manipulation. The project's core leverages Rust's performance, employs tree-sitter for parsing, and provides a CLI interface, targeting developers working on code maintenance, code modernization, and enforcing coding standards.
