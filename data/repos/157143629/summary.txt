Pampy.js is a lightweight JavaScript pattern matching library (250 lines, zero dependencies) that brings functional programming pattern matching capabilities to JavaScript and Node.js environments. Designed for web developers and functional programming enthusiasts, it enables declarative code patterns through structural matching of primitives, arrays, objects, functions, and complex nested data structures. The library supports advanced features like tail matching (TAIL), wildcard patterns (_), type-based matching (Number, String, Array), and predicate functions, allowing developers to replace complex conditional logic with readable pattern-action pairs. Key use cases include implementing recursive algorithms (Fibonacci), building interpreters (Lisp calculator), data transformation pipelines, and simplifying control flow in functional JavaScript applications where traditional if-else chains become unwieldy.
