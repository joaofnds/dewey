Trivy is a comprehensive security scanner written in Go that performs vulnerability detection and compliance scanning across multiple DevOps and cloud-native targets. It scans container images, filesystems, Git repositories, virtual machine images, and Kubernetes clusters to identify OS package vulnerabilities (CVEs), software dependencies for SBOM generation, Infrastructure-as-Code misconfigurations, exposed secrets, and software license compliance issues. The tool integrates into CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions, Kubernetes operators, and IDE plugins, targeting DevSecOps engineers, security professionals, and platform engineers who need automated security scanning in containerized and cloud environments. Trivy addresses the critical problem of comprehensive security assessment across the entire software supply chain from code repositories to production Kubernetes deployments.
