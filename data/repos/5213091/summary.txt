`bspwm` is a tiling window manager designed for the X Window System, written in C. It arranges windows as leaves in a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree, providing a method to manage window placement.  Key functionality involves responding to X events via a dedicated socket and interacting with a third-party program like `sxhkd` for keyboard and pointer input handling, which then invokes `bspc` to communicate with `bspwm`. Configuration is primarily done via shell scripts and utilizes `sxhkd` for bindings, offering various window insertion modes like manual, automatic (longest side, alternate, and spiral) schemes for flexible layout control. This is a standalone application aimed at Linux users seeking a customizable and efficient tiling window management experience.
