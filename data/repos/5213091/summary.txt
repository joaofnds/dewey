bspwm is a minimalist tiling window manager for X11-based Linux/Unix desktop environments that organizes windows using binary space partitioning algorithms. Written in C, it represents windows as leaves in a full binary tree structure, automatically dividing screen real estate into non-overlapping rectangular regions. The system follows a modular Unix philosophy architecture where bspwm handles only window management logic, communicating via dedicated sockets with bspc (command-line client) and external programs like sxhkd for keyboard/mouse input handling. It targets advanced Linux users, system administrators, and developers who prefer keyboard-driven workflows and scriptable window management over traditional desktop environments. The manager supports multiple monitors, virtual desktops, manual and automatic window insertion modes, and shell-script based configuration, making it popular among minimalist desktop setups and power users seeking efficient workspace organization.
