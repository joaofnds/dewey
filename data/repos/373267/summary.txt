This repository contains the source code for Clojars, a community-driven Maven repository specifically designed for hosting and distributing open-source Clojure libraries. Built entirely in Clojure, the web application serves the Clojure/ClojureScript development community by providing package management infrastructure similar to npm or PyPI. The system integrates with PostgreSQL for metadata storage, ElasticMQ for message queuing, and MinIO for artifact storage, following a microservices-oriented architecture with Docker Compose for local development orchestration. The platform enables Clojure developers to publish, discover, and consume libraries through both web interface and build tools like Leiningen and deps.edn, solving the critical need for centralized dependency management in the Clojure ecosystem. Target users include Clojure library authors who need to distribute their code and application developers who need to consume third-party dependencies.
