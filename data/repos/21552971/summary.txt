This repository is a comprehensive curated collection of command-line tools, shell frameworks, and CLI utilities organized into categories like shells (bash, zsh, fish), productivity tools, system utilities, and development frameworks. It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who work extensively with Unix/Linux command-line environments. The collection covers various shell ecosystems including Bash, Zsh, Fish, and modern alternatives like Nushell and Elvish, along with terminal multiplexers, file managers, text processing tools, and automation utilities. It serves as a centralized reference for discovering and evaluating CLI tools to enhance terminal productivity, system administration tasks, and shell scripting workflows. The repository functions as a knowledge base rather than containing executable code, helping technical professionals identify the right command-line tools for their specific use cases.
