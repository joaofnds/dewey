Klipse is a JavaScript plugin that embeds interactive, executable code snippets directly into web pages for technical blogs and documentation. It transforms static code blocks into live editors powered by CodeMirror, enabling real-time code execution and modification without server-side processing. The plugin supports 20+ programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Clojure/ClojureScript, Ruby, C++, SQL, and functional languages like Scheme and Common Lisp, using browser-based interpreters and transpilers like Skulpt, Opal, and Self-Hosted ClojureScript. Targeted at technical bloggers, documentation writers, and educators in web development and programming education, Klipse solves the problem of static code examples by making them interactive and immediately executable, enhancing reader engagement and learning through hands-on experimentation within the browser environment.
