Rack is a foundational Ruby web server interface that provides a standardized abstraction layer between HTTP web servers and Ruby web frameworks. It defines a minimal specification that wraps HTTP requests and responses into a single method call, enabling interoperability across diverse web servers (Puma, Unicorn, Falcon, Passenger) and frameworks (Rails, Sinatra, Hanami, Roda). The library includes essential middleware components for common web application concerns like logging, content compression, static file serving, and HTTP header management. Rack solves the fragmentation problem in Ruby's web ecosystem by establishing a universal contract that allows any compliant application to run on any supported server without modification. It targets Ruby web developers building server-side applications and framework authors requiring standardized HTTP handling primitives.
