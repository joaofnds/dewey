Rack is a Ruby library providing a modular web server interface, acting as a bridge between web servers, web frameworks, and web applications. It defines a minimal, adaptable specification for handling HTTP requests and responses, enabling developers to create web applications that are server-agnostic. Key features include middleware for tasks like logging, compression, and static file serving, along with helper interfaces for request and response handling, testing, and routing. This library facilitates building web applications within the Ruby ecosystem, and supports many web servers and web frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Sinatra.
