`ueberauth/guardian` is an Elixir library providing token-based authentication for Elixir applications, primarily targeting web applications built with frameworks like Phoenix and Plug. It supports JSON Web Tokens (JWT) by default and allows for custom token types, enabling functionalities such as token encoding, decoding, verification, and revocation. The library integrates with Plug for web endpoint authentication and provides features for handling multiple token configurations, custom claims, and hooks for advanced control over token behavior, as well as a pluggable architecture allowing flexibility in integrating with diverse systems. It's a core component for backend developers implementing secure user authentication.
