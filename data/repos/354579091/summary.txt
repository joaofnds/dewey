nvim-lsp-installer is a deprecated Neovim plugin written in Lua that provided automated installation and management of Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers for software development workflows. It targeted developers using Neovim as their primary editor, enabling seamless installation of LSP servers for 100+ programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, and C/C++. The plugin integrated with nvim-lspconfig to enhance PATH variables and provide a graphical UI for server management, supporting custom versions, automatic updates, and cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux). It solved the complex manual setup process of LSP servers by automating dependency management and executable linking. Development has moved to mason.nvim, which expands beyond LSP servers to include DAP servers, linters, formatters, and other development tools with improved architecture and broader package management capabilities.
