This repository contains a personal development environment configuration for macOS, targeting software developers who work in terminal-based workflows. It provides a comprehensive dotfiles setup managed through GNU Stow for symbolic link deployment, integrating Homebrew package management, Neovim text editor with Lua/Fennel configuration, tmux terminal multiplexer, Kitty terminal emulator, yabai tiling window manager, and skhd hotkey daemon. The configuration automates macOS system preferences and development tool setup through shell scripts and makefiles, solving the common problem of reproducible development environment provisioning across machines. Primary users are command-line oriented developers, particularly those working in functional programming languages given the Clojure/Fennel emphasis, who require consistent, version-controlled system configurations for productivity optimization.
