`elfeed-org` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to configure the Elfeed RSS reader using an Org mode file. Its core functionality allows users to manage their RSS feed subscriptions and apply tagging rules based on content or feed properties within a hierarchical structure defined in an Org file, improving organization compared to Elfeed's default flat list approach. The package provides features for importing and exporting feed configurations via OPML format and supports tag inheritance, title-based filtering, and feed exclusion, leveraging Org mode's link support for feed titles. As an Emacs extension, it is primarily a developer productivity tool targeting Emacs users who utilize Elfeed for RSS feed management.
