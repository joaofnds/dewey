This Emacs Lisp package enables RSS feed management for Elfeed users through Org-mode configuration files, targeting Emacs power users and knowledge workers who manage large collections of RSS subscriptions. It solves the scalability problem of maintaining tags and hierarchical organization in traditional flat feed lists by leveraging Org-mode's hierarchical structure and tag inheritance system. Users can organize feeds in nested headlines with automatic tag propagation, regex-based entry filtering, custom feed titles via Org links, and OPML import/export functionality. The package integrates deeply with the Emacs ecosystem, specifically bridging Elfeed RSS reader and Org-mode, allowing configuration across multiple files and trees. It targets developers, researchers, and information professionals who prefer Emacs-based workflows and need sophisticated RSS feed categorization beyond simple flat lists, particularly those already using Org-mode for task and knowledge management.
