Onivim 2 is a native modal code editor built in Reason/OCaml using the Revery UI framework, targeting software developers who prefer Vim-style modal editing with modern IDE features. The editor integrates libvim for authentic Vim keybindings and buffer management while leveraging VSCode's extension host process to provide full VSCode plugin compatibility including language servers and debuggers. It addresses the performance limitations of Electron-based editors by implementing a native frontend while maintaining rich language integration and tooling support. The project targets cross-platform deployment (Windows, macOS, Linux) and serves developers seeking the speed of native editors like Sublime Text combined with Vim's modal editing paradigm and VSCode's extensive plugin ecosystem, particularly appealing to vim users transitioning from terminal-based editors to GUI environments.
