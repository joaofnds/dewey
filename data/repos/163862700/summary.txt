Onivim 2 is a native, lightweight, cross-platform modal code editor designed to provide a fast, modern user experience akin to Sublime, while integrating VSCode's language support and Vim's modal editing. Built using ReasonML and the Revery framework, it leverages libvim for modal editing and VSCode Extension Host integration, enabling support for VSCode extensions. This standalone GUI application aims to be a performant and user-friendly alternative for developers on Windows, macOS, and Linux, offering features like VSCode plugin compatibility and "batteries included" functionality for out-of-the-box usability.
