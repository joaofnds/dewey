TinyGo is a Go compiler targeting resource-constrained environments, including microcontrollers, WebAssembly (WASM/WASI) runtimes, and command-line tools. It leverages LLVM for compilation, enabling support for diverse hardware architectures like ARM, AVR, and ESP32, as well as WebAssembly platforms for both browser (WASM) and server-side (WASI) execution. Key functionalities include compiling Go programs with small binary sizes, support for common microcontroller boards, and compatibility with a subset of the Go standard library. This project is a compiler and toolchain, offering a means to develop embedded systems and WASM applications using the Go programming language.
