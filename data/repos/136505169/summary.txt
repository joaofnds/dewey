TinyGo is an alternative Go compiler built on LLVM that targets resource-constrained environments including microcontrollers, WebAssembly (WASM/WASI), and command-line tools. It serves embedded systems developers and WebAssembly engineers by enabling Go programming for Arduino, ESP32, STM32, ARM Cortex-M, and other microcontroller platforms, while also supporting WASI runtimes like Fastly Compute and Fermyon Spin. The compiler leverages Go's standard language tools with LLVM backend optimization to produce significantly smaller binaries than standard Go, addressing memory and storage limitations in embedded devices. It includes hardware abstraction layers for GPIO, I2C, SPI protocols and supports over 94 microcontroller boards, making Go accessible for IoT developers, embedded engineers, and WebAssembly application developers.
