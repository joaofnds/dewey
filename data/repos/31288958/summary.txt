HashiCorp Vault is a comprehensive secrets management platform built in Go that addresses enterprise security and DevOps requirements for credential lifecycle management. The system provides centralized storage and access control for sensitive data including API keys, database credentials, certificates, and encryption keys through a unified REST API. Core functionality includes dynamic secret generation with automatic expiration, encryption-as-a-service capabilities, detailed audit logging, and policy-based access control with lease management. Vault integrates with cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), databases, identity systems, and storage backends like Consul, targeting DevOps engineers, security teams, and system administrators who need to eliminate hardcoded secrets and implement zero-trust security models in distributed infrastructure and microservices architectures.
