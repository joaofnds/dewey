`vim-jsx` is a Vim script plugin providing syntax highlighting and indentation for JSX code within the Vim text editor. It enhances developer productivity by correctly formatting and color-coding JSX, which is used to embed XML-like structures within JavaScript. The plugin integrates with existing JavaScript syntax highlighters like `pangloss/vim-javascript` and allows customization, such as only enabling JSX highlighting for files with the `.jsx` extension or files using a specific pragma. This is a Vim plugin, intended for developers using Vim for frontend development with React or similar libraries that utilize JSX.
