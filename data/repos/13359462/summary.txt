vim-jsx is a deprecated Vim script package that provided syntax highlighting and indentation support for JSX (JavaScript XML) code within the Vim text editor. Targeting React web developers, it enabled proper syntax coloring and code formatting for JSX files by bridging JavaScript and XML syntax packages, specifically requiring pangloss/vim-javascript as a dependency. The plugin addressed the problem of Vim's lack of native JSX support, allowing developers to work with React components containing inline XML syntax within JavaScript files. It supported both .js and .jsx file extensions with configurable options for pragma requirements and file extension restrictions. Though widely used in the React ecosystem from 2014-2019, it became incompatible with updated JavaScript syntax packages and has been superseded by MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty for modern React development workflows.
