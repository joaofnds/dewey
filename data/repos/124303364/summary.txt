Squoosh is a client-side image compression web application built with TypeScript that enables users to reduce image file sizes using various modern codecs directly in the browser. Targeting web developers, designers, and content creators, it leverages WebAssembly (WASM) implementations of image compression algorithms to process images locally without server uploads, ensuring privacy and eliminating bandwidth concerns. The application supports multiple image formats and compression standards, providing real-time comparison between original and compressed images with adjustable quality settings. As a Progressive Web App (PWA), it offers offline functionality and can be installed on devices, making it a practical tool for optimizing web assets and reducing page load times in web development workflows.
