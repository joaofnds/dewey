Eclipse Che is a Kubernetes-native cloud development environment platform that provides containerized workspaces for enterprise development teams. Built primarily in TypeScript, it deploys complete development environments as Kubernetes pods containing web-based IDEs (including VS Code), project dependencies, and containerized runtimes. The platform addresses the challenge of consistent, reproducible development environments by eliminating "works on my machine" issues through standardized, portable workspaces defined via devfiles. It targets software development teams and DevOps engineers who need scalable, collaborative coding environments that can run anywhere Kubernetes is deployed. Che integrates with existing Git workflows, supports VS Code extensions, and provides enterprise-grade features for managing distributed development infrastructure across cloud and on-premises Kubernetes clusters.
