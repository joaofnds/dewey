Recursive is a Python-based variable font development project targeting programming environments and application interfaces. Built using fontmake and fonttools, it produces variable font families optimized for code editors and UI frameworks. The repository contains Python automation scripts for font generation, specimen creation, and build processes that support Google Fonts distribution standards. It addresses the specific needs of developers and UI/UX designers who require monospace and sans-serif typefaces with consistent metrics across weight, slant, and expression axes. The superplexed metrics ensure no layout reflow during font transitions, solving a critical problem in dynamic interfaces and interactive typography applications where text shifting disrupts user experience.
