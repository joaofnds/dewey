The TwP/inifile repository provides a native Ruby gem for parsing and manipulating INI configuration files, commonly used in system administration and application configuration management. Built purely in Ruby without external dependencies, it handles the flexible INI format popularized by Windows but widely adopted by cross-platform systems like Samba and Trac. The library supports advanced INI features including sections, global properties, multi-line values, escape characters, automatic type casting (booleans, integers, floats), and configurable comment styles. It addresses the configuration management needs of Ruby developers and system administrators who require robust parsing of INI files for application settings, deployment configurations, and system integration tasks across diverse environments.
