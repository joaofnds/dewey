The `inifile` repository provides a native Ruby library for parsing and generating INI configuration files. It allows reading and writing data structured in the INI format, handling sections, properties, comments, and multi-line values. The library supports value type casting for booleans, integers, floats, and nil, along with escape character handling. This is a library project intended for Ruby developers needing to manage configuration settings in a flexible, text-based format often utilized for application configuration.
