DrawDB is a browser-based database entity relationship diagram (ERD) editor built with React and JavaScript that enables database architects and developers to visually design database schemas and generate SQL scripts. The application targets database developers, software engineers, and data architects working with relational database design across multiple database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, SQL Server, and Oracle. Built using React for the frontend with TailwindCSS for styling, it leverages IndexedDB for local storage and SVG for diagram rendering. The tool addresses the need for accessible database schema visualization and SQL code generation without requiring server-side dependencies or user accounts, allowing users to create ERDs, define table relationships, and export DDL scripts directly in the browser for database development workflows.
