The Emacs Application Framework (EAF) is a Python-based extensible framework that bridges Emacs Lisp with modern GUI capabilities through Qt6 integration, addressing Emacs' inherent graphical and performance limitations. Built for Emacs power users and developers who want comprehensive IDE functionality without leaving their text editor, EAF provides native applications including a Chromium-based web browser, PDF viewer, video/music players, file manager, RSS reader, and terminal emulator. The framework leverages Python's ecosystem and Qt's rendering engine to deliver modern graphical interfaces while preserving Emacs' keyboard-driven workflow and extensibility model. This targets software developers, researchers, and technical writers who prefer Emacs but require multimedia capabilities, efficient document viewing, and web browsing integration within their primary development environment.
