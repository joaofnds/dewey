Amber is a programming language designed to compile to Bash, facilitating the creation of shell scripts, especially for cloud services. Developed in Rust, the project provides a high-level language abstraction over Bash, simplifying script development. The repository represents a compiler project, enabling users to write code in Amber and have it translated into executable Bash scripts, streamlining shell scripting tasks. The project is targeted at developers seeking an easier way to write and manage shell scripts, potentially for automating infrastructure or cloud-related tasks.
