cljs-http is a ClojureScript HTTP client library designed for web developers building browser-based applications with ClojureScript. It provides asynchronous HTTP request capabilities using core.async channels, enabling non-blocking communication with REST APIs and web services. The library supports multiple content serialization formats (JSON, EDN, Transit, form data), multipart file uploads, HTTP Basic authentication, OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens, JSONP requests, and upload/download progress monitoring. Built on top of XMLHttpRequest and core.async primitives, it abstracts away browser HTTP complexities while maintaining functional programming idioms. The library targets ClojureScript developers who need robust HTTP client functionality for single-page applications, API integrations, and browser-based data fetching workflows in the functional web development ecosystem.
