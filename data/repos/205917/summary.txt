This repository contains a comprehensive personal dotfiles configuration system for software developers working on macOS and Linux environments. Built around a custom configuration framework called "Fig," it manages development toolchain setup including Neovim, tmux, Zsh shell, and terminal emulators like Kitty. The system provides unified color theming across tools, advanced keyboard customization via Karabiner-Elements and Hammerspoon, clipboard integration with remote hosts, and automated software installation through Homebrew. Key technologies include Vim Script, Lua, shell scripting, and various terminal-based development tools. It solves the complex problem of maintaining consistent, portable development environments across multiple machines, targeting experienced developers and system administrators who require sophisticated terminal-based workflows with extensive customization and automation capabilities.
