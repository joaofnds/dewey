GoogleContainerTools/distroless is a Docker container image repository built with Bazel and Starlark that provides minimal, language-specific runtime images for containerized applications targeting DevOps and cloud deployment workflows. The project creates "distroless" images containing only application runtime dependencies without traditional Linux distribution components like package managers, shells, or system utilities, supporting Java, Python, Node.js, Go, and other language stacks. Built on Debian 12 with multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64, s390x, ppc64le), these images significantly reduce container size (as small as 2MB) and attack surface compared to standard base images like Alpine or Ubuntu. The project serves container engineers, platform developers, and DevOps teams seeking secure, minimal production containers while maintaining compatibility with Docker multi-stage builds and Kubernetes deployment pipelines.
