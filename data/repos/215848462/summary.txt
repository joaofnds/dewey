Imagine is a CSS stylesheet theme designed for Org mode HTML exports, targeting technical writers and developers who use Emacs for documentation. The repository provides professional styling for org-mode documents exported to HTML, supporting LaTeX math rendering, syntax-highlighted code blocks, tables, and lists. It integrates with Emacs org-mode's HTML export functionality by leveraging CSS classes generated during the export process, requiring configuration of `org-html-htmlize-output-type` for proper syntax highlighting. The theme addresses the common problem of poorly-styled HTML output from org-mode exports, providing a clean, single-page layout that maintains readability while supporting technical content. Primary users are Emacs users, technical writers, and developers who create documentation or publish content using org-mode's export capabilities.
