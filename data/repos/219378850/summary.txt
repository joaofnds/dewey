CNN Explainer is an interactive web-based visualization tool built in JavaScript that teaches Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) through visual learning techniques. Targeting the machine learning education domain, it addresses the challenge of making deep learning concepts accessible to non-experts by providing real-time, interactive visualizations of CNN operations and data flow. The application demonstrates core CNN components like convolution layers, pooling, and feature maps using a pre-trained TinyVGG model for image classification. Built as a client-side web application using modern JavaScript frameworks, it serves educators, students, and ML practitioners who need intuitive explanations of CNN architectures and operations, bridging the gap between theoretical deep learning concepts and practical understanding through interactive visual exploration.
