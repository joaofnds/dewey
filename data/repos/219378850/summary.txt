CNN Explainer is a JavaScript-based interactive visualization application designed to facilitate learning about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It provides an interactive interface for exploring CNNs, aiding non-experts in understanding their inner workings through visual representations. This web application leverages interactive visualizations to explain CNN concepts. It is a research artifact and demonstration tool, accompanied by a publication in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).
