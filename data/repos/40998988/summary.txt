This repository implements a GraphQL wrapper around the Star Wars API (SWAPI), transforming the REST-based SWAPI into a GraphQL schema and server. Built for web developers working with GraphQL APIs, it demonstrates practical GraphQL implementation using graphql-js runtime, DataLoader for request batching and caching, and express-graphql for HTTP endpoints. The project targets full-stack developers learning GraphQL patterns or needing a Star Wars data source for applications. It includes AWS Lambda deployment support via aws-serverless-express and provides GraphiQL for interactive API exploration. The wrapper solves the common problem of converting legacy REST APIs to modern GraphQL interfaces while showcasing enterprise-grade patterns like data loading optimization and serverless deployment strategies.
