`graphql/swapi-graphql` is a JavaScript-based project providing a GraphQL API wrapper for the SWAPI (Star Wars API) data. It transforms the SWAPI into a GraphQL schema, enabling users to query and access SWAPI data using GraphQL. Built with `graphql-js`, `DataLoader`, and `express-graphql`, it includes a local server implementation and utilizes `aws-serverless-express` for AWS Lambda deployment, and features integration with `GraphiQL` for API exploration. This project serves as an example and practical implementation for developers utilizing GraphQL to consume external REST APIs.
