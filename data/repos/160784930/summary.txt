NutsDB is a pure Go embeddable key-value database designed for applications requiring persistent storage with ACID transaction support. It implements a log-structured storage engine with support for multiple data structures including lists, sets, and sorted sets, making it suitable for backend applications, caching layers, and embedded systems. The database provides fully serializable transactions through a bucket-based organization system and offers configurable storage options including segment size management and various indexing modes. Built for Go developers who need a lightweight alternative to heavyweight databases like Redis or embedded solutions like BoltDB, NutsDB targets use cases in web applications, microservices, and standalone applications where simple deployment, transaction safety, and structured data operations are essential without external database dependencies.
