This is a Vim plugin designed for Rails web developers that provides quick database table inspection capabilities within the editor. It wraps PostgreSQL's `psql \d` command to display table schema information in a Vim popup window when working with Rails model files. The plugin automatically determines the database name through three methods: explicit configuration, parsing `config/database.yml` using `yq`, or inferring from the directory name. It requires Vim 8.2+ for popup window support and targets Ruby on Rails developers who need to quickly reference database table structures without leaving their editor. The plugin solves the workflow friction of switching between code editing and database inspection by integrating PostgreSQL schema introspection directly into the Vim editing environment, making it particularly useful for Rails developers working with ActiveRecord models.
