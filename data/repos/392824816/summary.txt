This Vim plugin, written in Vim script, provides a utility for displaying database table details within a Vim environment, specifically leveraging the Postgres `psql \d` command. Functionality centers on executing the `DisplayTableSummary` command, which, when invoked from a Rails model file, displays the output of `\d <table_name>` in a Vim popup window. The plugin determines the database name through user configuration, `config/database.yml` parsing with `yq`, or directory name inference. It targets Vim users and requires Vim version 8.2+ due to its reliance on popup windows, and does not support Neovim. This is a plugin designed to enhance developer productivity within the context of database interaction.
