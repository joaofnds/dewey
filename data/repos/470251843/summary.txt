This repository provides JavaScript templates designed for Browser In The Browser (BITB) phishing attacks. It offers customizable HTML templates containing variables for domain name, path, title, and phishing link, enabling the creation of deceptive, embedded browser window simulations. Functionality includes a dark mode delay effect using jQuery and guidance on detecting the OS's color preference for template selection. The project functions as a set of example templates and a demonstration for offensive security research.
