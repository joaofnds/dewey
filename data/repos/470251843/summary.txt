BITB is a JavaScript-based template collection for creating Browser-in-the-Browser (BITB) phishing attack simulations in the cybersecurity domain. The repository provides HTML/CSS/JavaScript templates that render fake browser windows using iframes to mimic legitimate authentication popups from services like Gmail or Microsoft. Templates include Windows dark/light modes with customizable variables for domain masquerading, page titles, and embedded phishing links, plus jQuery-based animations for realistic window behavior. The codebase addresses penetration testing and security awareness training use cases, enabling security professionals and researchers to demonstrate sophisticated phishing techniques that exploit user trust in browser UI elements. Detection methods are documented including window dragging tests and browser extensions for iframe protection.
