This repository provides an Electron boilerplate for creating desktop applications using TypeScript, React, Jest, and ESLint. It facilitates the rapid development of Electron applications through a pre-configured project setup, offering a starting point with dependency management handled by a package manager (npm/yarn). The boilerplate supports packaging the application for the user's operating system. It functions as a template/example project for frontend developers.
