This repository is an Electron application boilerplate designed for cross-platform desktop development, combining Electron framework with React for UI components and TypeScript for type-safe JavaScript development. Targeting web developers transitioning to desktop application development, it provides a pre-configured development environment with integrated testing via Jest and code quality enforcement through ESLint. The boilerplate solves the initial setup complexity of combining these technologies, offering automated packaging for distribution across different operating systems. It serves frontend developers who want to leverage their web development skills (React/TypeScript) to build native desktop applications without learning platform-specific technologies, providing a complete starter template with modern development tooling and best practices already configured.
