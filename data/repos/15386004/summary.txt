`evil-exchange` is an Emacs Lisp plugin providing a text exchange operator, ported from the `vim-exchange` Vim plugin. It enables users to easily exchange text sections across buffers using intuitive keybindings, primarily `gx` and `gX`, enhancing text editing workflows within the Evil mode of Emacs. The plugin offers customizable keybindings and aims to mimic the behavior of the original Vim plugin, including compatibility through `evil-exchange-cx-install`, and addresses the buffer-local limitation of its Vim counterpart. It targets Emacs users who utilize Evil mode for a Vim-like text editing experience, offering productivity enhancements for text manipulation.
