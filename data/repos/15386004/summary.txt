evil-exchange is an Emacs Lisp package that ports vim-exchange functionality to Evil mode, providing text exchange operators for Emacs users who prefer Vim-style editing. It targets software developers and text editors working in the Emacs ecosystem who want to swap text regions efficiently using modal editing paradigms. The package implements `gx` and `gX` key bindings to define and exchange text motions across buffers, with support for visual mode selection and repeat operations. It extends beyond the original Vim plugin by enabling cross-buffer text exchanges and maintaining correctness during intermediate text modifications. The tool integrates with Evil mode's operator framework and is distributed through MELPA and NonGNU ELPA package repositories, solving the workflow problem of efficiently rearranging code blocks and text segments without manual cut-and-paste operations.
