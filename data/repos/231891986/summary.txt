Org-roam is an Emacs Lisp package providing a personal knowledge management (PKM) system, specifically a plain-text replica of Roam Research functionality within Org-mode. It enables non-hierarchical note-taking, supporting features like bidirectional linking (backlinks) for networked thought, graph visualization of connections, and offline operation with optional GPG encryption. This plugin extends the Org-mode ecosystem, allowing users to leverage Emacs' text editing capabilities and the wider package ecosystem. It is a plugin/extension designed for users of Emacs and Org-mode seeking to manage their personal knowledge bases using the Zettelkasten method or similar non-hierarchical note-taking approaches.
