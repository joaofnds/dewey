Org-roam is an Emacs Lisp package that implements a plain-text knowledge management system within the Org-mode ecosystem, targeting academics, researchers, and knowledge workers who use Emacs. It replicates core features of Roam Research by enabling non-hierarchical note-taking using Zettelkasten principles, with bidirectional linking, backlink discovery, and graph visualization capabilities. Built on Emacs Lisp with dependencies including emacsql for database operations and magit-section for UI components, it addresses the personal knowledge management (PKM) domain by allowing users to create interconnected note networks stored as plain-text Org files. The system provides offline, encrypted note-taking with powerful search and connection discovery features, specifically serving Emacs users who prefer local, text-based workflows over cloud-based knowledge management solutions.
