PGO (Postgres Operator) is a Kubernetes operator written in Go that automates PostgreSQL database cluster management and provisioning within Kubernetes environments. Targeting DevOps engineers and database administrators in cloud-native infrastructure, it provides declarative PostgreSQL deployment with automated high availability, disaster recovery, backup management, and monitoring capabilities. The operator leverages Kubernetes custom resources and controllers to manage PostgreSQL lifecycle operations including scaling, failover, rolling updates, and cluster replication across multiple availability zones. It addresses the complexity of running production-grade PostgreSQL databases in containerized environments by automating operational tasks like backup scheduling, connection pooling with pgBouncer, and TLS certificate management, enabling database-as-a-service functionality for organizations adopting GitOps workflows and cloud-native data infrastructure.
