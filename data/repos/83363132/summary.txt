The `CrunchyData/postgres-operator` is a Kubernetes operator designed for managing production-ready PostgreSQL clusters, providing database-as-a-service functionality. It enables declarative PostgreSQL cluster provisioning, high availability with automated failover, disaster recovery using pgBackRest for backups and restores, and secure TLS communication. Built in Go, the operator offers features including monitoring, upgrade management, advanced replication, cloning, connection pooling via pgBouncer, and extensive customization options, including resource allocation, PostgreSQL configuration, and backup scheduling. This project is a standalone application, specifically a Kubernetes operator, targeting system administrators and DevOps engineers seeking to deploy and manage PostgreSQL databases within a Kubernetes environment.
