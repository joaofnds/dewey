Squirrel is a code generation tool for Gleam developers that produces type-safe SQL database interaction code. It addresses the challenge of maintaining synchronization between SQL queries and their corresponding decoders/encoders in Gleam applications. Developers write standard SQL queries in `.sql` files, and Squirrel automatically generates corresponding Gleam functions with proper type safety, parameter binding, and result decoding. The tool integrates with PostgreSQL databases through the `pog` library and uses Gleam's `decode/zero` for result parsing. Targeted at backend developers building database-driven applications in Gleam, it eliminates boilerplate code while preserving SQL editor features like syntax highlighting and query analysis tools, offering an alternative to traditional ORMs by embracing raw SQL rather than abstracting it away.
