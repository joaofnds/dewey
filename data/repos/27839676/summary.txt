Spotifyd is a lightweight Spotify client daemon written in Rust that runs as a UNIX background service, designed for the audio streaming and media server domain. Built on the librespot reverse-engineered Spotify protocol implementation, it provides a headless alternative to the official Spotify client while maintaining full compatibility with Spotify Connect for remote control from official applications. The daemon streams music directly from Spotify's servers and appears as a controllable device in the Spotify ecosystem, requiring a Premium subscription for functionality. It targets system administrators, Linux enthusiasts, and developers who need a resource-efficient Spotify client for headless servers, embedded systems, or lightweight desktop environments where the official client would be too resource-intensive or inappropriate.
