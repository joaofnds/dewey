`spotifyd` is a Rust-based daemon designed to function as a lightweight, open-source Spotify client. It streams music similarly to the official Spotify client while offering Spotify Connect support, enabling control from official Spotify applications. This standalone application provides a platform-independent alternative for Spotify playback, leveraging Rust for potentially improved performance and cross-platform compatibility. Targeted at users with a Spotify Premium subscription, the project's primary functionality centers on music streaming and device emulation within the Spotify ecosystem.
