Scrcpy is a cross-platform Android device mirroring and control application written in C that enables real-time screen mirroring, audio forwarding, and remote control of Android devices over USB or TCP/IP connections. Built using FFmpeg/libav for media processing and SDL2 for rendering, it targets mobile developers, QA engineers, and Android enthusiasts who need to interact with Android devices from desktop environments without requiring root access or device-side app installation. The application leverages Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and Android's native APIs to capture video/audio streams, supports hardware-accelerated encoding (H.264/H.265), provides low-latency input injection via HID simulation, and includes advanced features like virtual display creation, camera mirroring, V4L2 webcam integration on Linux, and OTG mode for direct USB control, making it essential for Android development workflows and device testing scenarios.
