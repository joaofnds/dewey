Apache Flink is an open-source distributed stream processing framework designed for real-time and batch data processing in big data environments. Built primarily in Java with APIs for Scala and Python, it provides low-latency, high-throughput processing of continuous data streams and finite datasets. The framework offers event-time processing, exactly-once guarantees, flexible windowing operations, and fault-tolerance mechanisms for mission-critical data pipelines. Flink integrates with the Apache Hadoop ecosystem (YARN, HDFS, HBase) and supports complex event processing, graph analytics, and machine learning workloads. It targets data engineers, stream processing developers, and big data architects who need to build scalable, real-time analytics systems, ETL pipelines, and event-driven applications in enterprise and cloud environments.
