This repository provides the official Node.js implementation of gRPC, a high-performance RPC framework for distributed systems and microservices architecture. Built primarily in TypeScript, it offers two implementations: a pure JavaScript client/server library (@grpc/grpc-js) and a deprecated C++-based version. The monorepo includes essential tooling such as Protocol Buffer loader for .proto file parsing, gRPC development tools with protoc compiler distribution, health check services for server monitoring, and reflection API services for service discovery. It targets backend developers and DevOps engineers building scalable web services, API gateways, and inter-service communication layers in Node.js environments, solving the complexity of implementing efficient, type-safe remote procedure calls across distributed applications.
