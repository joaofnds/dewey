`grpc/grpc-node` is a Node.js implementation of the gRPC framework, facilitating the development of high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) applications. It provides both pure JavaScript and C++ addon-based client and server implementations, enabling cross-platform compatibility. Key functionalities include loading `.proto` files, generating gRPC service definitions, and offering tools and services like health checks and reflection APIs for gRPC server management. This project serves as a library and development tools, specifically targeting Node.js developers building distributed systems and APIs using gRPC.
