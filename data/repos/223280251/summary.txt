This TypeScript library provides a NestJS module that integrates Prometheus monitoring capabilities into Node.js web applications. Built for the DevOps and web development domain, it enables developers to expose application metrics through HTTP endpoints for Prometheus scraping. The module supports all standard Prometheus metric types (Counter, Gauge, Histogram, Summary) with dependency injection, configurable default metrics collection, custom metric prefixing, and Pushgateway integration. It leverages the prom-client library and NestJS's decorator-based architecture to simplify metrics instrumentation in enterprise Node.js applications. Target users are backend developers and DevOps engineers implementing observability and monitoring solutions in microservice architectures.
