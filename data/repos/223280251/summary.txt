`nestjs-prometheus` is a TypeScript library providing a NestJS module for integrating Prometheus monitoring. It enables the collection and exposure of application metrics through a `/metrics` endpoint, offering customizable configuration for default metrics, labels, and the metrics endpoint path. The module supports injecting individual Prometheus metrics (counters, gauges, histograms, and summaries) and facilitates custom controller implementations.  It's designed as a library for NestJS backend applications, allowing developers to instrument their services for Prometheus monitoring and alerting.
