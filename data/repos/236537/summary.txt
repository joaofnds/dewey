fswatch is a cross-platform file system monitoring utility written in C++ that provides real-time notifications when files or directories are modified. It implements multiple platform-specific backends including Apple's FSEvents API, BSD kqueue, Linux inotify, Solaris File Events Notification, Windows ReadDirectoryChangesW, and a fallback stat()-based monitor. The tool targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who need automated file change detection for build systems, deployment pipelines, development workflows, and system monitoring tasks. fswatch offers both a command-line interface and libfswatch library with C, C++, and Go bindings, supporting recursive directory monitoring, regex-based path filtering, and customizable event output formats across Unix-like systems and Windows.
