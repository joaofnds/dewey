`fswatch` is a cross-platform file change monitoring application and library, designed for real-time event notification on file system modifications. Primarily written in C++, it provides a command-line interface and a C/C++ library (`libfswatch`), leveraging platform-specific APIs like inotify (Linux), kqueue (BSD/macOS), and Windows API for efficient monitoring. Key features include recursive directory monitoring, path filtering using regular expressions, and customizable event formatting, with the ability to select different monitoring backends based on the operating system. This is a developer tool, particularly useful for build systems, synchronization utilities, or any application requiring immediate responses to file system changes, offering bindings for C, C++, and Go.
