El-mock.el is a mocking library specifically designed for Emacs Lisp development and testing workflows. This library enables Emacs Lisp developers to create test doubles and stub functions during unit testing, allowing them to isolate code under test from external dependencies. The core functionality revolves around the `with-mock` macro and `stub` mechanism, which temporarily replace function implementations with controlled mock behaviors that return predetermined values. Built entirely in Emacs Lisp, it integrates seamlessly with the Emacs ecosystem and is distributed through MELPA package repositories. The library addresses the critical testing challenge of dependency isolation in Emacs Lisp codebases, enabling developers to write more reliable and deterministic unit tests by mocking file system operations, network calls, and other external interactions. Target users include Emacs package developers, Emacs configuration maintainers, and anyone developing non-trivial Emacs Lisp applications who need robust testing capabilities with proper test isolation and mocking support.
