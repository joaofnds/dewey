`el-mock.el` is an Emacs Lisp library providing mocking capabilities for Emacs development and testing. It enables developers to define mock implementations for Emacs functions, allowing for controlled testing environments by stubbing function calls and altering their return values. Key features include `with-mock` and `mocklet` macros for defining and applying mock behavior within test contexts. This library is designed as a development tool and is integrated with Emacs projects to facilitate unit testing of Emacs Lisp code.
