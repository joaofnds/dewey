`hey` is a command-line HTTP load generator written in Go, designed as an ApacheBench (ab) replacement. It facilitates performance testing of web applications by simulating a specified number of requests with configurable concurrency, rate limiting, and duration. Key features include support for HTTP/2, custom headers, request bodies, and output in CSV format for detailed metric analysis. This standalone application targets developers and system administrators for assessing web server performance and identifying bottlenecks.
