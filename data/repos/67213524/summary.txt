**hey** is a command-line HTTP load testing tool written in Go that serves as a modern replacement for ApacheBench (ab). Designed for web developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators, it generates configurable HTTP traffic to benchmark web applications and APIs. The tool supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 protocols, offering flexible request parameters including concurrency levels, request rates (QPS), custom headers, authentication, proxies, and various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It provides comprehensive performance metrics and supports both request count-based and duration-based testing scenarios. hey addresses the need for reliable web service performance testing and capacity planning, enabling users to simulate realistic load conditions and identify bottlenecks in web infrastructure before production deployment.
