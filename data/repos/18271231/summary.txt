`throttler` is a Clojure library designed to control the throughput of function calls and `core.async` channels, utilizing the token bucket algorithm for rate limiting and burst control. It provides functionalities to throttle both individual functions/channels and groups of them under a shared rate using `throttle-fn`, `throttle-chan`, `fn-throttler`, and `chan-throttler`. This library allows developers to manage API call rates, channel message throughput, and overall system resource usage with high accuracy across a range of rates. The library is designed for developers seeking a lightweight and efficient solution for rate limiting within Clojure applications, offering fine-grained control without requiring dedicated threads for each throttler instance.
