Throttler is a Clojure library that implements rate limiting for function calls and core.async channels using the token bucket algorithm. It targets backend developers and API integrators who need to control throughput to comply with rate limits, manage resource consumption, or prevent system overload. The library leverages Clojure's core.async for lightweight, thread-efficient throttling without relying on Thread/sleep, enabling accurate rate control from 0.1 to 50,000 operations per second with ~10% accuracy. Key features include configurable burst rates, statistical multiplexing for throttling multiple functions/channels under shared rate limits, and support for complex scenarios like API quota management across multiple endpoints. The solution addresses common distributed systems challenges around backpressure, API rate limiting, and resource throttling in concurrent Clojure applications.
