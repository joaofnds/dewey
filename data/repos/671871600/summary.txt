org-timeblock is an Emacs Lisp package that implements visual timeblocking functionality within the Emacs text editor ecosystem, specifically targeting org-mode users for task scheduling and time management. Built for productivity-focused developers, researchers, and knowledge workers who use Emacs as their primary workflow environment, it renders SVG-based calendar views of scheduled tasks, deadlines, and timestamped events from org-mode files. The package addresses the limitation of org-agenda's list-only display by providing interactive multi-day timeblock visualizations similar to modern calendar applications. It integrates deeply with org-mode's scheduling system, allowing users to reschedule tasks, set durations, and manage time-specific entries through keyboard-driven commands while maintaining the text-based workflow philosophy of Emacs users.
