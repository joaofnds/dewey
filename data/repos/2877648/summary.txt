expand-region.el is an Emacs Lisp extension that provides intelligent text selection expansion based on semantic units and language-aware parsing. Targeting software developers and text editors users across multiple programming languages, it incrementally expands selections from cursor position through syntactic boundaries like words, symbols, quotes, parentheses, method calls, HTML tags, and S-expressions. The package implements language-specific expansion strategies for various modes including HTML, with extensible architecture allowing custom expansions via buffer-local configuration. It leverages Emacs' built-in parsing capabilities and integrates with ELPA package management systems (MELPA, GNU ELPA) for distribution. The tool addresses the common developer workflow problem of precisely selecting code constructs without manual character-by-character selection, enhancing productivity in code editing, refactoring, and navigation tasks within the Emacs ecosystem.
