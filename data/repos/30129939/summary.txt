DDDSample-core is a reference implementation demonstrating Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architectural patterns and practices through a cargo shipping management system. Built with Spring Boot and Java, this educational codebase illustrates core DDD concepts including bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, value objects, and domain services within a logistics domain context. The application manages cargo tracking, handling events, and shipping operations using an in-process HSQL database, and exposes REST APIs for handling reports. Developed collaboratively by Domain Language and Citerus, it serves as a practical learning resource for software architects and enterprise Java developers seeking to understand and implement DDD principles in real-world applications, moving beyond theoretical concepts to concrete code examples.
