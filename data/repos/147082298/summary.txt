GoCity is a code visualization tool that implements the Code City metaphor to represent Go source code as interactive 3D cityscapes. Built with Go backend and React frontend using babylon.js for 3D rendering, it maps code structure to urban elements: folders become districts, files become buildings, and structs appear as structures on building tops. Building characteristics reflect code metricsâ€”Lines of Code (LOC) determines color intensity, Number of Variables (NOV) affects base size, and Number of Methods (NOM) controls height. The tool serves software developers, researchers, and engineering teams in the software development domain for code comprehension, architecture visualization, and codebase analysis. It supports both local directory analysis and GitHub repository visualization through a web interface, addressing the challenge of understanding complex Go codebases through spatial visual representation rather than traditional text-based code review.
