`gocity` is a Go-based, standalone command-line application and web server designed for 3D source code visualization using the Code City metaphor. It transforms Go project structures into interactive 3D cityscapes, representing folders as districts, files as buildings, and code metrics (lines of code, number of variables, number of methods) as building characteristics. The application utilizes React for the front-end UI and babylon.js for 3D rendering, enabling users to explore Go codebase architectures. The project is a research artifact, demonstrated through its publication in a scientific conference, and offers both command-line and web-based access to the visualizations, targeting Go developers and researchers interested in software visualization.
