Expectations is a minimalist unit testing framework for Clojure and ClojureScript applications, designed as an alternative to the standard `clojure.test` framework. This "classic" version operates independently with its own tooling ecosystem and is not compatible with `clojure.test`-based tools, though a compatible variant exists for broader ecosystem integration. The framework targets Clojure developers seeking a lightweight, expressive approach to writing test assertions and specifications. It supports both Clojure JVM and ClojureScript environments, enabling cross-platform testing capabilities. The library addresses the need for more readable and concise test syntax compared to traditional xUnit-style testing frameworks, allowing developers to express expected behaviors and outcomes in a more natural, declarative manner within functional programming workflows.
