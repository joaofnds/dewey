`expectations` is a Clojure library providing a minimalist unit testing framework, considered a legacy version. It focuses on assertion-based testing and is not compatible with `clojure.test`-based tooling. The library enables developers to write and execute tests, including both Clojure and ClojureScript compatible tests, with features for deliberately failing tests to confirm failure behavior. This library is a developer productivity tool focused on providing core testing capabilities and runs using `lein` build tool, making it a library designed for Clojure developers.
