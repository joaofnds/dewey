Wisp is a web framework written in Gleam that provides HTTP request/response handling for web application development. Built around a handler-middleware architecture, it enables developers to create web services by composing functions that process HTTP requests and return responses. The framework includes built-in middleware for common web development tasks like request logging, static file serving, and request routing. Handlers accept HTTP requests and application context (such as database connections) to generate responses, while middleware functions wrap these handlers to add cross-cutting concerns. Targeting Gleam developers building web applications and APIs, Wisp simplifies web server development by abstracting HTTP protocol complexities and providing composable building blocks for request processing pipelines.
