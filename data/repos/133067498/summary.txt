Kustomize is a Kubernetes configuration management tool written in Go that enables template-free customization of YAML manifests for container orchestration deployments. Targeting the DevOps and cloud-native infrastructure domain, it allows system administrators and platform engineers to patch and modify Kubernetes API objects without altering original configuration files. The tool implements a declarative overlay system where base configurations can be customized for multiple environments (development, staging, production) through kustomization files that specify patches, labels, and resource transformations. Integrated directly into kubectl since version 1.14, kustomize solves the configuration drift problem by maintaining environment-specific variants while preserving the ability to track upstream changes, making it essential for GitOps workflows and multi-environment Kubernetes deployments.
