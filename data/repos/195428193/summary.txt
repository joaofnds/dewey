Moveable is a TypeScript-based UI interaction library for web development that provides comprehensive element manipulation capabilities including drag, resize, scale, rotate, warp, pinch, group, and snap operations on DOM elements. Built for frontend developers working on interactive web applications, it offers framework-agnostic support with dedicated packages for React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Preact, and Lit through a monorepo architecture. The library solves the complex problem of implementing smooth, performant element transformations with visual feedback controls, handling touch/mouse events, matrix calculations, and collision detection. It targets web developers building content editors, design tools, dashboard builders, or any application requiring direct manipulation interfaces with geometric transformations and constraint-based positioning systems.
