Vue Router is the official client-side routing library for Vue.js 2 applications, enabling single-page application (SPA) navigation without full page reloads. Built in JavaScript, it provides declarative route mapping, nested routing, programmatic navigation, route guards, and dynamic route matching for web developers building Vue.js applications. The library integrates seamlessly with Vue.js components to manage browser history, handle URL changes, and render appropriate components based on the current route. It solves the core problem of navigation state management in SPAs by providing a robust routing system that supports features like lazy loading, transition effects, and route-based code splitting. Target users are frontend web developers and JavaScript engineers building interactive web applications with Vue.js 2 framework.
