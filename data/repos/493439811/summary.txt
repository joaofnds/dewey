**mo** is a functional programming library for Go developers that implements monadic abstractions and type-safe error handling using Go 1.18+ generics. The library provides core functional programming data types including Option[T] (Maybe), Result[T], Either[A,B], Future[T], IO[T], and State[S,A] monads, enabling developers to write more robust and composable code with explicit null safety and error propagation. Inspired by Scala, Rust, and FP-TS ecosystems, it targets Go backend developers, systems programmers, and teams adopting functional programming paradigms who need type-safe alternatives to traditional Go error handling patterns. The library solves common issues around nil pointer dereferences, error composition, and async operations through monadic chaining operations like FlatMap, Map, and Match, while maintaining zero external dependencies beyond Go's standard library.
