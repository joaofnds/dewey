Goose is a database migration management tool written in Go that provides both CLI and library interfaces for managing database schema evolution through incremental SQL changes and Go functions. Targeting backend developers and DevOps engineers in web development and database administration domains, it supports multiple database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, ClickHouse, MSSQL, Vertica, and YDB. The tool solves the critical problem of versioned database schema management by enabling forward/backward migrations, out-of-order migration support, embedded migrations, environment variable substitution, and data seeding capabilities. It offers flexible deployment options through direct binary installation, Homebrew, or embedded Go applications, with customizable build tags to exclude unused database drivers for optimized binary size, making it essential for teams managing evolving database schemas across development, staging, and production environments.
