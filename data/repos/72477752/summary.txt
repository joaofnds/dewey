Pulumi is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform written in Go that enables infrastructure provisioning and management through general-purpose programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, Java) instead of domain-specific YAML/JSON configurations. Targeting DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and cloud architects, it provides a unified SDK and CLI tool for managing resources across major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), Kubernetes clusters, and 120+ infrastructure providers. The platform solves the complexity and limitations of traditional IaC tools by leveraging familiar programming constructs like loops, functions, and package management for infrastructure deployment. Its core engine handles resource lifecycle management, state tracking, and dependency resolution while supporting both imperative infrastructure management and programmatic automation through its Automation API for embedding IaC capabilities into applications and CI/CD pipelines.
