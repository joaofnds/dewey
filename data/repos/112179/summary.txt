Vifm is a cross-platform, console-based file manager providing a Vim-like interface for file system navigation and object management. Written in C and utilizing the ncurses library, it allows users to manage files with Vim-inspired keybindings, modes, registers, and commands. This standalone application aims to provide an efficient and customizable file management experience, offering features similar to the `mutt` email client and extending beyond simple keybindings to emulate the core functionalities of Vim.
