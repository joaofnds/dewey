Vifm is a terminal-based file manager written in C that provides a Vim-like interface for file system navigation and management. Built on the ncurses library for cross-platform console compatibility, it targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who prefer keyboard-driven workflows and terminal environments. The application implements Vim's modal editing paradigm, keybindings, registers, and command structure for file operations, eliminating the need for mouse interaction or GUI file managers. Vifm addresses the problem of efficient file management in server environments, remote systems, and headless installations where graphical interfaces are unavailable or impractical. It follows Unix philosophy principles, offering extensive customization through configuration files while maintaining core functionality for power users who value terminal-based productivity tools.
