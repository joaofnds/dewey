Ghostty is a cross-platform terminal emulator written in Zig targeting developers and system administrators who require high-performance terminal interfaces with native platform integration. The project implements a multi-renderer architecture using OpenGL on Linux and Metal on macOS for GPU-accelerated rendering, while maintaining standards compliance with ECMA-48 and xterm control sequences. It features a dedicated IO thread for low-latency input handling, supports windowing features like tabs and splits, and provides libghostty as a C-compatible library for embedding terminal functionality in third-party applications. The macOS implementation uses SwiftUI with CoreText, while Linux builds utilize GTK, addressing the DevOps and developer tooling domain where terminal performance and native OS integration are critical for productivity.
