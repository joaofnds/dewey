Flameshot is a cross-platform desktop screenshot utility built with C++ and Qt framework, targeting system administrators, developers, and power users who need advanced screen capture capabilities. The application provides a GUI-based screenshot editor with annotation tools, supports multiple capture modes (fullscreen, region selection, delayed capture), and integrates with system clipboards and external services like Imgur. It features a DBus interface for programmatic control, CLI commands for automation workflows, and runs as a background service with system tray integration. The software addresses the need for feature-rich screenshot functionality beyond basic OS tools, particularly in Linux desktop environments (KDE, GNOME, XFCE), while maintaining compatibility with Windows and macOS through Qt's cross-platform capabilities.
