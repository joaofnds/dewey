Ugbi is a Vim plugin designed to provide a humorous response to the `UserGettingBored` autocommand event in Vim. It triggers when a user repeats the same alphanumeric character 42 times in insert mode, offering user-configurable actions with `:UgbiEnable` and `:UgbiDisable` commands. The plugin is written in Vim Script, utilizes features like key remapping in insert mode and positional highlighting, and is compatible with Vim 8.0 and greater, with optional truecolor terminal support enabled via `termguicolors`. This is a Vim plugin targeting Vim users and developers, providing enhanced interactive behavior within the Vim text editor.
