The FasterXML/jackson repository serves as the central portal for the Jackson project, a comprehensive Java library suite for data processing. Jackson provides core JSON parsing and generation capabilities, along with data-binding functionalities to convert Java objects to and from JSON. It extends its capabilities with modular support for a wide array of data formats including Avro, CBOR, CSV, XML, and YAML, alongside datatype modules for libraries like Guava and Joda-Time. The project primarily functions as a core library and framework, targeting Java developers who require flexible and performant data serialization and deserialization solutions, especially those working with JSON and related data formats.
