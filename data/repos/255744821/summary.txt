Fix Inventory is a Python-based, open-source CLI application designed to identify and remediate security risks and compliance issues across multi-cloud infrastructure environments, including AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, and Kubernetes. It functions by collecting inventory data through agentless cloud API queries, normalizing the data into a graph-based schema, and triaging risks using custom and pre-configured policies. Key features include a human-readable query language for policy enforcement and security analysis, a dependency and access graph for identifying hidden attack paths, and the ability to generate compliance reports. The project is a security-focused standalone application targeting cloud and security engineers, offering integrations for data export, alerting, and remediation workflows, with a strong emphasis on cloud security posture management (CSPM) and infrastructure-as-code practices.
