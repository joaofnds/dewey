Fix Inventory is an open-source Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) platform built in Python that provides agentless security scanning and compliance monitoring across multi-cloud environments including AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, and DigitalOcean. The system uses a graph-based data model to collect, normalize, and analyze cloud infrastructure metadata, storing resource relationships and dependencies in a unified schema with over 40 base resource types. It implements policy-as-code through a custom query language and CLI interface, enabling automated security assessments against compliance frameworks like CIS benchmarks, ISO-27001, and custom rules. Designed for cloud security engineers and DevOps teams, it addresses cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), container security, and security audit workflows by providing dependency mapping, risk analysis, and automated remediation capabilities across distributed cloud infrastructures.
