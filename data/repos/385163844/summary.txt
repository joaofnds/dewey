Twilight.nvim is a Lua plugin for Neovim 0.5+ that enhances code editing focus by dimming inactive code portions using TreeSitter syntax analysis. Targeting software developers and text editor users, it integrates with Neovim's LSP ecosystem and TreeSitter parsing capabilities to intelligently identify code context boundaries (functions, methods, conditionals) and apply visual dimming to non-active sections. The plugin solves code readability and focus issues during development by creating a spotlight effect around the current editing context, with configurable dimming levels, context expansion rules, and automatic integration with zen-mode for distraction-free coding environments. It serves as a modern replacement for Vim's Limelight plugin, leveraging TreeSitter's superior syntax understanding over traditional regex-based approaches.
