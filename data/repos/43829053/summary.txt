HugSQL is a Clojure library that bridges SQL database operations with functional programming paradigms by allowing developers to write raw SQL queries in separate files and automatically generate corresponding Clojure functions. Targeting backend web development and data-driven applications, it solves the impedance mismatch between SQL databases and Clojure code without requiring heavy ORM frameworks or extensive DSLs. The library supports parameterized queries, multiple database adapters, and provides compile-time SQL parsing to generate idiomatic Clojure functions that execute SQL statements. Designed for Clojure developers building database-backed applications, HugSQL enables a SQL-first approach while maintaining functional programming principles and leveraging existing SQL expertise within JVM-based backend systems.
