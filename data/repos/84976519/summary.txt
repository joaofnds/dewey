This archived repository provided a solution for implementing scheduled cron jobs with Google Cloud Functions for Firebase by leveraging Google App Engine's cron service. Targeting serverless web developers and Firebase practitioners, it addressed the limitation of Cloud Functions lacking native scheduling capabilities before April 2019. The library enabled developers to trigger Firebase Cloud Functions on predetermined schedules using App Engine cron.yaml configuration files, bridging the gap between Google Cloud Platform's cron infrastructure and Firebase's serverless function execution environment. It primarily served backend developers building serverless applications who needed time-based function triggers for tasks like data cleanup, periodic API calls, or automated maintenance operations within the Firebase ecosystem.
