Kanata is a cross-platform, Rust-based, keyboard remapping application designed to enhance keyboard comfort and usability. It provides advanced customization options, including multiple key layers, tap-hold functionality, macros, and Unicode output, enabling users to remap keys and create custom keyboard layouts. Functionally, this standalone application intercepts keyboard input on Linux, macOS, and Windows, employing an interception driver on some platforms for enhanced control. This project primarily targets users seeking greater control over their keyboard input and customization of their existing hardware.
