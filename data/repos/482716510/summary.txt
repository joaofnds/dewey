Kanata is a cross-platform keyboard remapping system written in Rust that provides advanced keyboard customization functionality across Linux, macOS, and Windows. It targets power users, system administrators, and developers seeking ergonomic keyboard improvements by implementing QMK-like features for any keyboard hardware. The system intercepts low-level keyboard input using platform-specific drivers (including Windows Interception driver support) and enables multi-layer key mapping, tap-hold behaviors, macros, Unicode output, and dynamic configuration reloading. Kanata addresses the limitation that advanced keyboard firmware like QMK is only available on specialized mechanical keyboards, democratizing ergonomic keyboard customization for laptop and standard office keyboards through software-based remapping with human-readable configuration files.
