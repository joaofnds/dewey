mimalloc is a high-performance general-purpose memory allocator implemented in C, designed as a drop-in replacement for standard malloc implementations. Targeting systems programming and runtime environments, it addresses memory allocation performance bottlenecks through innovative free list sharding techniques that distribute allocation across multiple per-page lists, reducing contention and fragmentation. The allocator features thread-safe concurrent operations using atomic CAS operations, eager page purging for memory pressure reduction, and security hardening options including guard pages and randomized allocation. Originally developed for functional programming language runtimes (Koka, Lean), it serves system programmers, language runtime developers, and performance-critical application developers across Linux, Windows, macOS, and embedded systems who require consistent low-latency memory allocation with minimal space overhead.
