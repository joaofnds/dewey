Asterius is a deprecated Haskell-to-WebAssembly compiler based on GHC, designed to compile Haskell source code into WebAssembly and JavaScript for execution in browsers or Node.js environments. It enables seamless JavaScript interop, supports a wide range of Haskell packages, and generates relatively small output code. This project provides tools, including `ahc-link` and `ahc-cabal`, for building and deploying Haskell applications to the web. It is a developer productivity tool targeting Haskell developers seeking to build web applications and is a standalone compiler.
