Asterius is a deprecated Haskell-to-WebAssembly compiler built on top of GHC that enabled Haskell developers to compile functional programs for web browsers and Node.js environments. The compiler targeted web development by translating Haskell source code and Cabal executable targets into WebAssembly+JavaScript bundles, featuring seamless JavaScript FFI with Promise support and producing compact output (~600KB for basic programs). It supported popular Haskell packages like lens, diagrams, pandoc, and ormolu, allowing functional programmers to deploy Haskell applications in web browsers without requiring separate JavaScript implementations. The project served Haskell developers seeking to leverage functional programming paradigms in web development contexts, but has been superseded by GHC's official WebAssembly backend integration.
