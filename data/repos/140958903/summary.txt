Expr is a Go-centric expression language and expression evaluator library designed for dynamic configuration and rule-based systems. It provides a safe, fast, and intuitive means of evaluating expressions, leveraging an optimizing compiler and bytecode virtual machine for performance. Key features include static typing, memory safety, side-effect-free evaluation, and seamless Go integration, enabling developers to incorporate expression evaluation within their Go projects without type redefinition.  This library offers built-in functions and a rich set of operators for tasks such as filtering, mapping, and rule evaluation, and is utilized as a rule and configuration engine in various applications. This is a library, providing a domain specific language (DSL) for use within Go projects.
