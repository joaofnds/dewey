RuboCop.el is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a streamlined interface for integrating RuboCop (Ruby static code analyzer and formatter) into the Emacs text editor. Targeting Ruby developers in web development and software engineering domains, it offers essential code quality management functionality including style checking, auto-formatting, and auto-correction capabilities. The package implements commands for running RuboCop operations on projects, directories, or individual files, with configurable keybindings through rubocop-mode and optional automatic correction on file save. Built specifically for Ruby development workflows, it serves as a lightweight alternative to more complex linting frameworks like Flycheck, focusing on direct RuboCop integration rather than general-purpose lint tool support for developers who primarily work with Ruby codebases.
