Geziyor is a high-performance web crawling and scraping framework written in Go, designed for data extraction from websites at scale. It targets data engineers, web scrapers, and Go developers who need to collect structured data from web sources for data mining, monitoring, and automated testing applications. The framework supports JavaScript rendering via Chrome integration, handles 5,000+ requests per second, and provides features like caching (Memory/Disk/LevelDB), proxy management, concurrency limiting, and automatic data export to JSON/CSV formats. Built on Go's concurrency model with goquery for HTML parsing, it addresses the need for robust, scalable web data extraction pipelines while handling modern JavaScript-heavy websites through headless browser automation.
