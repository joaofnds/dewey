`bebo` is a command-line tool enabling execution of Clojure scripts within the Deno JavaScript/TypeScript runtime, leveraging the SCI interpreter. It allows users to run ClojureScript files directly from URLs or local files, facilitating server-side Clojure execution in a modern runtime environment. Key functionalities include script execution via `run.ts` and a standalone executable compilation option using `deno compile`, enabling faster startup times. This is a developer productivity tool built with Clojure and Deno, and utilizes libraries like SCI for ClojureScript interpretation.
