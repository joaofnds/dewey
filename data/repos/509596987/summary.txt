Bebo is a Clojure-to-Deno bridge tool that enables execution of Clojure scripts on the Deno JavaScript/TypeScript runtime using the SCI (Small Clojure Interpreter). Built with ClojureScript and Shadow-CLJS, it targets web developers and Clojure programmers who want to leverage Deno's modern runtime capabilities while writing server-side applications in Clojure syntax. The tool provides CDN-based installation, standalone executable compilation, and script running capabilities for .cljs files, solving the problem of running functional Clojure code in Deno's secure, TypeScript-native environment. Primary use cases include building HTTP servers and web applications where developers prefer Clojure's functional programming paradigm over JavaScript while benefiting from Deno's built-in security model, TypeScript support, and modern web APIs.
