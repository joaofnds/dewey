OpenEmu is a macOS-native retro gaming emulation frontend built with Swift and Objective-C, utilizing modern Apple frameworks including Cocoa, Metal, and Core Animation. The application employs a modular plugin architecture to integrate multiple third-party emulation engines (Stella, Mednafen, mGBA, Dolphin, etc.) while providing a unified macOS interface for managing and playing classic console games. It supports over 30 gaming systems from Atari 2600 to PlayStation Portable, abstracting the complexity of individual emulators behind a cohesive user experience. The project targets retro gaming enthusiasts and casual users seeking a polished, native macOS solution for classic game emulation, eliminating the need to configure multiple standalone emulators while leveraging macOS-specific technologies for performance optimization.
