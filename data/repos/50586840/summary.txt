MJML is a JavaScript-based markup language framework specifically designed for developing responsive HTML emails. Built by Mailjet, it addresses the notorious difficulty of creating cross-client compatible email templates by providing a semantic markup syntax that compiles to responsive HTML. The framework includes a comprehensive CLI tool, Node.js API, and standard component library that abstracts complex email rendering quirks across different email clients. MJML targets email developers, marketing teams, and frontend developers who need to create email campaigns, transactional emails, and newsletters. The toolchain supports real-time compilation, template validation, and integrates with popular development environments through VS Code and Sublime Text plugins, solving the critical problem of email HTML compatibility without requiring deep knowledge of email client rendering inconsistencies.
