PgHero is a Ruby-based performance monitoring dashboard specifically designed for PostgreSQL database administration and optimization. Built as a Rails engine with multiple deployment options (Docker, Linux package, standalone), it provides database administrators and backend developers with real-time visibility into PostgreSQL performance metrics, query analysis, and system health indicators. The tool leverages PostgreSQL's internal statistics and system catalogs to surface critical performance data through a web-based interface, enabling identification of slow queries, indexing opportunities, and resource bottlenecks. Targeted at DevOps engineers, database administrators, and Ruby/Rails developers managing PostgreSQL deployments, PgHero addresses the common challenge of database performance monitoring and optimization in production environments, complementing related tools in the PostgreSQL ecosystem for comprehensive database management workflows.
