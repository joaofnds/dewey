Flagger is a Go-based Kubernetes operator designed for progressive delivery, automating application release processes within the Kubernetes ecosystem. It implements Canary, A/B testing, and Blue/Green deployment strategies, integrating with various service meshes (Istio, Linkerd, App Mesh, etc.) and ingress controllers (Contour, Nginx, Gloo, etc.) to manage traffic shifting and deployment validation. Functionality includes metrics analysis, webhook integration for pre and post-deployment tasks, and alerting. As a Kubernetes operator, it's a standalone application targeting DevOps engineers and platform teams deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes.
