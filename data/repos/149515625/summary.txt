Flagger is a Kubernetes-native progressive delivery operator written in Go that automates canary deployments, A/B testing, and blue/green releases for containerized applications. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform teams, it integrates with service meshes (Istio, Linkerd, AWS App Mesh), ingress controllers (NGINX, Traefik, Contour), and monitoring systems to gradually shift traffic between application versions while analyzing metrics and running conformance tests. Part of the Flux GitOps ecosystem and CNCF project, Flagger uses custom resource definitions (CRDs) to define deployment strategies, monitors application health through Prometheus metrics, and automatically promotes or rolls back deployments based on configurable success criteria, reducing risk in production software releases.
