CL Machine-Learning (`clml`) is a Common Lisp library providing high-performance, large-scale statistical machine learning capabilities. Key functionalities include a hierarchical system of modules for various machine learning algorithms such as classifiers (linear and logistic regression, Naive Bayes), clustering (k-means, spectral clustering), decision trees, and time series analysis, alongside utility functions for data handling. The project offers API documentation, tests leveraging lisp-unit, and integrates with Quicklisp for dependency management, targeting Common Lisp developers and researchers working on machine learning tasks.
