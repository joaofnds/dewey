CLML (Common Lisp Machine Learning Library) is a comprehensive statistical machine learning framework implemented in Common Lisp, originally developed at MSI and designed for high-performance, large-scale data analysis applications. The library targets data scientists and machine learning researchers working in the Common Lisp ecosystem, providing implementations of core ML algorithms including linear/logistic regression, naive Bayes classifiers, k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, association rule mining, and various statistical utilities. Built for cross-platform compatibility across SBCL, CCL, LispWorks, and Allegro Common Lisp implementations, CLML integrates with ASDF3 and Quicklisp for package management and includes data fetching utilities for remote dataset access via HTTP/HTTPS. The modular architecture organizes functionality into independent subsystems covering classification, clustering, statistics, and data preprocessing, making it suitable for both academic research and production machine learning workflows in Lisp-based environments.
