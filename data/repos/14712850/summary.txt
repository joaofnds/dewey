Syncthing is an open-source peer-to-peer file synchronization application written in Go that provides continuous, decentralized data synchronization across multiple devices without requiring cloud services or centralized servers. Targeting personal users, system administrators, and privacy-conscious organizations, it operates in the file management and data synchronization domain using P2P networking protocols with built-in encryption for secure data transmission. The application implements automatic conflict resolution, version control, and cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux) while prioritizing data integrity and user privacy. It solves the problem of keeping files synchronized across devices without relying on third-party cloud storage services, offering a self-hosted alternative to commercial sync solutions like Dropbox or Google Drive for users who require local control over their data synchronization infrastructure.
