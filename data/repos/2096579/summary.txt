**Marked** is a high-performance JavaScript markdown parser and compiler designed for web development environments. It transforms Markdown syntax into HTML output, supporting CommonMark specification and GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) standards. The library operates as a low-level compiler without caching mechanisms, prioritizing speed and lightweight operation while maintaining full markdown feature compatibility. It provides cross-platform functionality across browsers, Node.js servers, and command-line interfaces, making it suitable for static site generators, documentation systems, content management platforms, and real-time markdown preview applications. Target users include frontend developers, technical writers, and full-stack engineers who need reliable markdown-to-HTML conversion in JavaScript applications, though it requires additional HTML sanitization libraries for security in production environments.
