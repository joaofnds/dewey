The Nim repository contains the complete implementation of the Nim programming language, including its compiler, standard library, and toolchain. Nim is a statically-typed, compiled systems programming language targeting system-level development, performance-critical applications, and general-purpose programming across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. The compiler uses a bootstrapping approach, initially compiled from C sources and supporting multiple backend targets including C, C++, and JavaScript. It emphasizes metaprogramming capabilities through macros, procedural programming paradigms, and zero-cost abstractions while maintaining Python-like syntax with Ada/Modula influences. The repository serves systems programmers, application developers, and performance-oriented software engineers who need compiled language efficiency with high-level language expressiveness, competing in domains traditionally occupied by C, C++, Rust, and Go.
