Nim is a statically typed, compiled systems programming language designed for efficiency, expressiveness, and elegance. It functions as a compiler and language implementation, facilitating the creation of performant software. Key features include support for macros and metaprogramming, enabling advanced code generation and customization. This project provides the core components for the Nim programming language, enabling developers to write and compile Nim code, targeting a wide range of applications from system-level utilities to more general-purpose programs.
