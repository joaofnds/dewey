Kit is a lightweight, modular Clojure web framework designed for building scalable production web applications. Built on Integrant for dependency injection and Aero for configuration management, it provides a comprehensive template system with pluggable libraries covering HTTP servers (Undertow, Jetty, HTTP Kit), databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, XTDB), templating (Selmer), caching (Redis), scheduling (Quartz), and development tools (nREPL). The framework addresses the common plumbing and boilerplate code required in Clojure web development by offering pre-configured, composable modules that can be mixed and matched through profile selection. Targeting Clojure web developers, Kit eliminates repetitive setup tasks while maintaining flexibility for customization, enabling rapid development of robust web services and applications in the Clojure ecosystem.
