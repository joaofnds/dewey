`kit-clj/kit` is a modular Clojure framework designed for building scalable web applications. It provides a structured template leveraging `integrant` and `aero` for configuration, simplifying common web development plumbing via a library system with customizable components. Key functionalities include support for various features via included libs such as metrics, database connectivity, HTTP clients, and templating, allowing developers to rapidly construct production-ready web applications. The framework utilizes Clojure, relies heavily on libraries like `integrant` and `aero`, and offers profiles to include different optional components; it is a framework project type intended for Clojure developers.
