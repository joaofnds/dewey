Redis is a high-performance, in-memory data structure server, functioning as a cache, database, and message broker designed for real-time data-driven applications. Written in C, it provides a wide array of data structures including strings, lists, sets, hashes, and JSON documents, enabling functionalities such as caching, session management, key-value storage, full-text and vector search, and pub/sub messaging. The project is a standalone, open-source database and includes a command-line interface (redis-cli) for interaction, and is extensible via a modules API. It is a core technology in many applications demanding low-latency access to data.
