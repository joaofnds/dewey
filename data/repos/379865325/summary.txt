Drizzle ORM is a lightweight TypeScript-first Object-Relational Mapping library designed for modern web development across JavaScript runtimes including Node.js, Bun, Deno, and edge environments. It provides type-safe database interactions for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite databases, including serverless platforms like Turso, Neon, PlanetScale, Cloudflare D1, and Vercel Postgres. The ORM features zero dependencies, tree-shaking support, and maintains a thin abstraction layer over SQL while offering both relational and SQL-like query builders. It addresses the need for performant, type-safe database operations in serverless and edge computing environments without requiring data proxies or Rust binaries. The ecosystem includes Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and Drizzle Studio for database management, targeting full-stack developers building TypeScript/JavaScript applications requiring robust database connectivity.
