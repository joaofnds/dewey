`drizzle-orm` is a headless TypeScript Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) designed for modern JavaScript runtimes. This library enables developers to define SQL schemas and build both relational and SQL-like queries, providing type safety and extensibility. Supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite databases, including serverless options like Turso, Neon, and Vercel Postgres, it's optimized for serverless environments and Edge runtimes such as Node, Bun, and Deno. The project includes a CLI tool, Drizzle Kit, for migrations and schema management, and Drizzle Studio for data browsing, primarily targeting TypeScript developers building database-driven applications.
