ruby-pg is a PostgreSQL client library that provides Ruby applications with native database connectivity through C extensions. Primarily serving web development and backend systems, it enables Ruby developers to execute SQL queries, manage database connections, and handle PostgreSQL-specific data types with high performance. The library implements comprehensive type casting between Ruby objects and PostgreSQL data types, supporting both text and binary protocols for optimal data transfer efficiency. Built with C for performance-critical database operations, it integrates seamlessly with Ruby applications, ORMs like ActiveRecord, and web frameworks such as Rails. Target users include Ruby backend developers, full-stack engineers, and database application architects who need reliable, fast PostgreSQL connectivity with advanced features like prepared statements, asynchronous queries, and custom type mapping for production database-driven applications.
