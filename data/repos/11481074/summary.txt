`ruby-pg` is a C-based client library providing a Ruby interface for interacting with PostgreSQL RDBMS. It enables Ruby applications to connect to and query PostgreSQL databases, supporting features like connection management, query execution, and result set iteration. The library offers type casting capabilities, allowing for customization of data encoding and decoding between Ruby and PostgreSQL column types via Encoders/Decoders and TypeMaps. As a Ruby library, it allows developers to integrate with PostgreSQL databases within their Ruby applications, with support for thread and Ractor compatibility.
