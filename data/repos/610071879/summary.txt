**org-ai** is an Emacs Lisp package that integrates generative AI capabilities directly into Emacs org-mode, targeting developers and technical writers who use Emacs as their primary editor. The package provides seamless access to OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E APIs, Azure OpenAI services, and local Stable Diffusion models through special `#+begin_ai...#+end_ai` org-mode blocks. Core functionality includes conversational AI interactions, text generation with customizable system/user prompts, image generation and variation, speech-to-text input via Whisper, and text-to-speech output. It supports multiple LLM backends including local models through oobabooga/text-generation-webui and offers global commands for AI-assisted editing across projects. The tool solves the workflow disruption problem by eliminating context switching between Emacs and external AI interfaces, enabling technical professionals to leverage AI assistance within their existing org-mode documentation and note-taking workflows.
