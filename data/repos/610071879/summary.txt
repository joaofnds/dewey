`org-ai` is an Emacs Lisp package that integrates generative AI models directly into the Emacs org-mode environment, serving as a personal AI assistant for enhanced text and image creation within org files. It supports interaction with OpenAI's ChatGPT and image generation through DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion via a web UI. Core functionality includes AI-driven text generation, image creation based on text prompts, speech input/output integration, and project-level AI commands; it is a plugin/extension for Emacs, extending org-mode's capabilities. Key technologies include Emacs Lisp, the OpenAI API, and integration with external services like Stable Diffusion web UI, and whisper.el for speech recognition, targeting Emacs users and developers seeking to leverage AI within their existing text-based workflows.
