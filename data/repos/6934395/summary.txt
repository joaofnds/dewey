RocksDB is a C++ library providing a persistent, embeddable key-value store optimized for fast storage, especially on flash drives. It utilizes a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design to manage write and read amplification factors, supporting multi-threaded compactions for efficient handling of terabyte-scale datasets. This library offers flexible tradeoffs for write and read performance, making it suitable for building high-performance storage solutions. It is a core component, intended for integration within other database systems or applications needing fast, persistent data storage.
