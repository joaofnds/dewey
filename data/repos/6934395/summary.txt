RocksDB is a high-performance embeddable key-value storage engine written in C++ that implements a Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM) architecture optimized for flash storage and multi-terabyte datasets. Built by Facebook's Database Engineering Team as an evolution of Google's LevelDB, it serves as a foundational component for database systems, caching layers, and storage backends requiring fast persistent data access. The library features multi-threaded compactions and configurable trade-offs between write amplification, read amplification, and space amplification factors. Target users include database developers, backend engineers, and systems architects building distributed systems, NoSQL databases, or applications requiring high-throughput persistent storage with predictable performance characteristics on modern SSD hardware.
