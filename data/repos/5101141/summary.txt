jq is a command-line JSON processor written in portable C that provides programmatic manipulation of JSON data structures through a domain-specific query language. Designed for DevOps, data engineering, and system administration workflows, it enables users to parse, filter, transform, and extract data from JSON documents using sed/awk-like operations. The tool features zero runtime dependencies, supports complex data transformations through functional programming constructs, and integrates seamlessly into shell scripts and CI/CD pipelines. Built with libtool, automake, and oniguruma regex library, jq addresses the critical need for efficient JSON processing in modern infrastructure automation, API data manipulation, and configuration management tasks targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and backend developers.
