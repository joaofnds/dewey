`jq` is a command-line JSON processor providing a lightweight and flexible toolset for manipulating JSON data. Written in portable C with zero runtime dependencies, it enables users to filter, map, and transform structured JSON from the command line, akin to `sed`, `awk`, and `grep` for JSON. The project is distributed as a standalone CLI application and offers prebuilt binaries, Docker images, and build-from-source options; its architecture includes support for statically linked builds and cross-compilation. Primarily, it's a developer productivity tool targeting system administrators and developers working with JSON data.
