`wakapi` is a self-hosted, minimalist backend application written in Go, designed for collecting and visualizing coding statistics, mirroring the functionality of WakaTime. It provides features for tracking coding time across projects, languages, editors, and operating systems, along with badge generation, email reports, and a REST API, supporting integration with WakaTime and Prometheus. Users can deploy `wakapi` via various methods, including Docker, direct binary execution, and Kubernetes, using SQLite, MySQL, or Postgres as database backends; making it a standalone web application and developer productivity tool. It's primarily intended for developers seeking self-hosted alternatives for their coding metrics.
