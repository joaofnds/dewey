Wakapi is a self-hosted, WakaTime-compatible backend service written in Go that provides coding statistics and time tracking for software developers. It serves as an open-source alternative to WakaTime's proprietary service, allowing developers to track programming activity across projects, languages, editors, and operating systems while maintaining data sovereignty. The system integrates with existing WakaTime client plugins across various IDEs and editors, collecting heartbeat data and generating statistical summaries, badges, and weekly reports. Built with a REST API, Docker support, and multiple database backends (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL), it targets individual developers and development teams seeking privacy-focused productivity analytics. The service includes features like public leaderboards, Prometheus metrics export, email reporting, and data import capabilities from WakaTime, making it suitable for both personal use and team-based development environments requiring coding activity insights.
