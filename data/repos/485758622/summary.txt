This repository contains G-code files and associated images, presenting designs for various keyboard layouts and prototypes. It primarily functions as a collection of keyboard designs, potentially targeting keyboard enthusiasts or those interested in custom keyboard builds. The project's core functionality revolves around providing design files for physical keyboards. The use of G-code suggests these files are intended for use with CNC machines or 3D printers to manufacture keyboard components.
