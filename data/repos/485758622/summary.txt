This repository contains custom mechanical keyboard designs and prototypes implemented primarily using G-code for CNC machining and fabrication. The project targets the mechanical keyboard enthusiast community and DIY hardware makers, featuring multiple keyboard variants including Ghazal, Wired Wizza, BatreeqV2Rectangle, Zazu, and Barghoot models. The designs appear to focus on ergonomic split keyboards and compact form factors, leveraging G-code programming for precise manufacturing of keyboard plates, cases, and mounting hardware. The repository serves hobbyist keyboard builders, makers, and hardware enthusiasts who want to fabricate custom mechanical keyboards using CNC machines, 3D printers, or other computer-controlled manufacturing tools. The project builds upon existing open-source keyboard designs from the mechanical keyboard community, providing manufacturing files and modifications for producing physical keyboard hardware prototypes.
