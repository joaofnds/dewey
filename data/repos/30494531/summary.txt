Oceanic Next Color Scheme is a syntax highlighting theme for Sublime Text editor specifically optimized for modern JavaScript development workflows. The color scheme leverages tmTheme format to provide enhanced visual distinction for ES6+ JavaScript syntax when used with babel-sublime syntax highlighter. It addresses the problem of inadequate syntax highlighting for next-generation JavaScript features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals that traditional color schemes fail to properly differentiate. The project targets front-end developers and JavaScript engineers working with modern ECMAScript features, React, and transpiled JavaScript codebases. Due to its popularity, the scheme has been ported across the development ecosystem to over 15 editors and terminals including VS Code, Vim, Atom, JetBrains IDEs, and iTerm2, establishing it as a standardized visual theme for JavaScript-focused development environments.
