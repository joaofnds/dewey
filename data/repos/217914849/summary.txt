Gleam's standard library provides core functionality and foundational modules for the Gleam programming language, a type-safe functional language that compiles to both Erlang and JavaScript targets. The library offers essential utilities for string manipulation, I/O operations, data structures, and cross-platform compatibility across Erlang/OTP 26+, Node.js, Deno, Bun, and modern browsers. It serves as the base dependency for Gleam developers building applications in domains ranging from web development to distributed systems, leveraging Erlang's actor model and fault-tolerance capabilities while maintaining JavaScript ecosystem compatibility. The stdlib abstracts platform differences and provides consistent APIs for functional programming patterns, enabling developers to write type-safe, concurrent applications that can deploy to both backend (Erlang/BEAM) and frontend (JavaScript) environments without code changes.
