April is a Common Lisp library that compiles a subset of the APL programming language, enabling array-oriented numeric processing within Lisp. It provides a compiler that translates APL expressions into Common Lisp code, supporting a significant portion of APL's functions and operators, including features like rational numbers and underscores within numbers. Key functionalities include basic APL evaluation using `april` and `april-f` macros, workspace management with the `april-create-workspace` and `april-clear-workspace` macros, and interoperability with Lisp via the `april-ref` function for accessing April workspace content. This project functions as a library with a command-line interface and examples, targeting Lisp developers interested in leveraging APL's array processing capabilities.
