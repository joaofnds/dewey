React Native is a cross-platform mobile application development framework that enables developers to build native iOS and Android applications using React's declarative JavaScript/TypeScript component model. The framework bridges JavaScript code with native platform APIs through a C++ runtime layer, allowing developers to access native UI components and device features while maintaining code reusability across platforms. It targets mobile developers familiar with React who want to avoid writing separate native codebases in Swift/Objective-C for iOS and Java/Kotlin for Android. The framework solves the mobile development efficiency problem by providing hot reloading, component-based architecture, and shared business logic while still delivering native performance and platform-specific user experiences through native UI rendering.
