React Native is a cross-platform framework for building native mobile applications for iOS and Android using React's declarative UI paradigm. It enables developers to write applications with native UI controls, leveraging JavaScript and the React component model for code reuse across platforms, enhancing developer velocity through features like live reloading. Built primarily with C++, this framework provides a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create interactive user interfaces and is aimed at mobile developers seeking to build native mobile applications with a single codebase.
