Luxon is a JavaScript library for comprehensive date and time manipulation, serving as a modern replacement for Moment.js in web development and Node.js applications. It provides immutable DateTime, Duration, and Interval types with a chainable API for parsing, formatting, and calculating temporal data. The library leverages native browser Intl APIs and IANA timezone databases for internationalization and timezone handling without requiring external locale files. Luxon addresses common JavaScript date/time pain points including timezone conversions, date arithmetic, ISO formatting, and locale-aware formatting. It targets JavaScript developers building web applications, APIs, and data processing systems that require robust temporal data handling with native internationalization support and immutable data structures.
