Thokr is a terminal-based typing practice application built in Rust that provides a command-line interface for improving typing speed and accuracy. Targeting developers and terminal users who prefer text-based interfaces, it implements a TUI (Terminal User Interface) using Rust's ecosystem to deliver typing tests with configurable word counts, time limits, and language sets (English variants with 200, 1K, or 10K most common words). The application features real-time typing visualization, performance metrics calculation (WPM, accuracy), and persistent CSV logging for progress tracking across sessions. It supports custom prompts, sentence-based tests, and cross-platform data storage following OS-specific configuration directories. Inspired by web-based typing tools like MonkeyType, thokr addresses the need for offline, terminal-native typing practice tools for CLI-focused users, system administrators, and developers who spend significant time in terminal environments.
