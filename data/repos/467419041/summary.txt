`thokr` is a Rust-based, command-line interface (CLI) application that provides a typing practice environment with visualized results and historical logging. It leverages the `tui` crate to render a terminal user interface for real-time feedback on typing accuracy and speed. Key features include customizable test parameters (word count, time limit, prompt selection), support for multiple English word lists, and persistent logging of typing test results. This standalone application targets developers and users seeking a terminal-based typing practice tool, similar to `monkeytype`.
