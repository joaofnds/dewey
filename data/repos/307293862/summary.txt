`webping.cloud` is a web application that measures network latency to multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean, Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, and Oracle Cloud, directly from a web browser. The application's core functionality is to perform "ping" tests, providing users with latency measurements to geographically distributed cloud infrastructure. Built with TypeScript, this project is a standalone web application accessible via a user-friendly interface, enabling users to quickly assess network performance to major cloud services.
