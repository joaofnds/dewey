webping.cloud is a browser-based network latency testing tool that measures connectivity performance to major cloud providers including AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and DigitalOcean. Built with TypeScript, the application enables real-time latency measurements from client browsers to the nearest data center endpoints across multiple cloud platforms. This tool addresses the DevOps and cloud infrastructure domain by helping system administrators, cloud architects, and developers evaluate network performance characteristics when selecting optimal cloud regions for application deployment. The web-based implementation eliminates the need for command-line tools or local network utilities, providing instant cloud connectivity insights for infrastructure planning and performance optimization decisions.
