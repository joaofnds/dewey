This Go package provides a high-level abstraction layer over Go's `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh` library to simplify SSH server development. Built for DevOps and backend infrastructure applications, it offers an HTTP-like API that enables developers to quickly implement custom SSH servers with minimal boilerplate code. The library wraps the low-level SSH protocol implementation with intuitive session handlers and connection management, making it accessible for building SSH-based tools, remote command execution systems, interactive terminals, and network infrastructure services. Target users include Go developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who need to embed SSH server functionality into applications without dealing with the complexity of the underlying SSH protocol implementation. The package supports session management, authentication handling, and channel operations while maintaining the security features of the standard crypto/ssh package.
