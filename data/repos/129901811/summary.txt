This repository is a comprehensive collection of Apache Kafka and Confluent Platform examples targeting data engineers, streaming architects, and platform developers working with event-driven architectures. It provides hands-on demonstrations of real-time data streaming, ETL pipelines, and microservices integration using technologies including Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, ksqlDB, Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, and Debezium for change data capture. The examples cover deployment scenarios from local development to cloud-native environments (Docker, Kubernetes) and demonstrate integration with databases, monitoring systems, and visualization tools like Elasticsearch and Kibana. Primary use cases include building streaming data pipelines, implementing event sourcing patterns, connecting disparate data systems through connectors, and establishing observability for distributed streaming applications across on-premises and cloud environments.
