Polly.JS is a JavaScript testing library for web development that records, replays, and stubs HTTP interactions during automated testing. Built for both Node.js and browser environments, it intercepts network requests through XHR and Fetch APIs, capturing real server responses in HAR (HTTP Archive) format for deterministic test replay. The library targets frontend and full-stack developers building web applications who need reliable HTTP mocking without maintaining manual fixtures. Polly integrates with testing frameworks like Mocha and QUnit, offering adapters for different request APIs and persisters for storing recorded interactions to disk or local storage. It solves the problem of keeping test fixtures synchronized with evolving APIs by automatically capturing actual server responses, enabling fast, offline test execution while providing programmatic control over request/response modification for simulating various application states.
