`offlinenotepad` is a browser-based, offline-first web application for secure and private note-taking. Built with JavaScript and leveraging a Vue frontend, it utilizes AES encryption via the crypto-js library to store user data locally within the browser. Key features include secure data synchronization across devices, a minimalist user interface, and the ability to "publish" notes via shareable links, exposing raw data via `/raw` endpoints. The project is a standalone web application primarily intended for individual note-taking and content management. It offers both a Go-based server backend as well as a Docker-based deployment strategy.
