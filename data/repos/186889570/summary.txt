**offlinenotepad** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that provides offline-first note-taking functionality with client-side encryption and cross-device synchronization. Built with a Vue.js frontend and Go backend, it implements AES encryption with PBKDF2 using crypto-js to secure notes both locally in browser storage and during server synchronization. The application targets web developers and privacy-conscious users requiring secure, accessible note-taking across devices including smartphones, laptops, and Chromebooks. Key features include client-side encryption/decryption, offline functionality through browser storage, optional server backup capabilities, public note publishing with random URLs, and automatic code formatting detection. The solution addresses the need for secure, minimalist note-taking that functions independently of network connectivity while maintaining data privacy through end-to-end encryption.
