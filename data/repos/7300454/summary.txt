`luminus-template` is a Leiningen template for generating web applications using the Clojure-based Luminus framework. It provides a starting point for projects, including basic structure and configuration. The template supports a wide array of features through profile hints, allowing developers to easily integrate various components like different web servers (Aleph, HTTP Kit, Jetty, Undertow), database backends (H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Datomic, SQLite, XTDB), service APIs (GraphQL, Swagger), and ClojureScript support with options for Reagent, re-frame, and shadow-cljs. This template aims to accelerate Clojure web application development by offering a customizable, modular architecture.
