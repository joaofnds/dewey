Luminus-Template is a Leiningen project template for bootstrapping web applications using the Luminus framework in Clojure. It targets web developers building server-side applications in the Clojure ecosystem by providing configurable project scaffolding with modular profile options. The template supports multiple web servers (Undertow, Jetty, Aleph, HTTP Kit), databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2, MongoDB, Datomic, SQLite, XTDB), authentication systems (OAuth, session-based), templating engines (Selmer, Hiccup), CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Bulma), and API formats (REST, GraphQL, Swagger). It addresses the complexity of manual project setup by automating dependency management, configuration, and boilerplate code generation for full-stack Clojure web development, enabling developers to quickly initialize production-ready applications with their preferred technology stack combinations.
