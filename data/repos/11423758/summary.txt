Quine Relay is a polyglot programming demonstration that implements a circular quine across 128+ programming languages, where each language's output serves as source code for the next language in the chain, ultimately regenerating the original Ruby program. This esoteric programming project spans diverse language ecosystems including Ruby, Rust, Scala, C/C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Haskell, assembly languages, and specialized interpreters for languages like Brainfuck, Whitespace, and Befunge. The repository targets programming language enthusiasts, computer science researchers, and developers interested in polyglot programming, compiler theory, and code generation techniques. It solves the complex technical challenge of maintaining syntactic and semantic compatibility across vastly different programming paradigms while demonstrating advanced knowledge of language-specific compilation toolchains, runtime environments, and cross-platform development workflows.
