`mame/quine-relay` is a Ruby-based project that generates a self-replicating "uroboros" program, a quine, across over 100 different programming languages, demonstrating code generation and cross-compilation capabilities.  It functions as a standalone CLI application, executing a chain of programs, each generating source code for the next language in the sequence. The core functionality involves a Ruby script (`QR.rb`) that initiates the relay, with the project heavily utilizing various interpreters and compilers for diverse languages, showcasing a complex dependency graph including languages like Rust, Scala, Scheme, and many more. It's a research artifact and example project aimed at demonstrating esoteric programming and compiler/interpreter interoperability.
