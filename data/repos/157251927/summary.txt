smtp2http is a lightweight SMTP server written in Go that bridges email communication with web applications by converting incoming SMTP requests into HTTP POST requests sent to configured webhooks. Targeting web developers and DevOps engineers, it solves the integration challenge of processing emails within web-based workflows without requiring complex mail server infrastructure. The application functions as an email-to-HTTP gateway, enabling applications to receive and process emails through standard REST API endpoints. Built with Go's networking capabilities and containerized with Docker, it supports configurable timeouts and webhook destinations, making it suitable for microservices architectures, automated email processing systems, and development environments where traditional email servers are impractical or unnecessary.
