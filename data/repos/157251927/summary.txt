`smtp2http` is a standalone application written in Go that acts as an SMTP server, receiving email messages and forwarding them as HTTP POST requests to a specified webhook endpoint. It facilitates the integration of email services with web applications and systems, essentially bridging the SMTP and HTTP protocols. Key functionality includes receiving SMTP requests, parsing email content, and dispatching this content to a user-defined HTTP endpoint, with configuration options for connection timeouts. This project provides a simple command-line interface and is designed for deployment both natively and within Docker containers, targeting developers needing to process email data within a web service environment.
