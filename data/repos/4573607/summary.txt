Invisible Captcha is a Ruby gem that provides unobtrusive spam protection for Rails web applications through honeypot-based anti-bot mechanisms. Designed for Rails developers, it implements multiple spam detection techniques including hidden form fields that bots typically fill but humans cannot see, time-sensitive form submission validation to detect automated submissions, and IP-based rate limiting. The gem integrates seamlessly into Rails controllers using before_action filters and view helpers, requiring minimal code changes while providing flexible customization options. It targets web developers building Rails applications who need effective spam protection without degrading user experience through traditional CAPTCHAs, making it particularly suitable for contact forms, user registration, and other user-facing forms vulnerable to automated spam attacks.
