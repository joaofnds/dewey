Ergo is a zero-dependency Go framework implementing the actor model for building distributed, event-driven systems inspired by Erlang/OTP. It targets backend developers and distributed systems engineers working on microservices architectures, providing network-transparent actor communication, fault-tolerant supervision trees, and built-in clustering capabilities. The framework addresses distributed system complexity by offering message-passing concurrency primitives, automatic service discovery, remote process spawning, and publish/subscribe event mechanisms. Key features include high-performance network stack (5M+ messages/sec over network), supervisor-based fault recovery, and ready-to-use components for state management. Designed for mission-critical applications requiring reliability and scalability, it enables seamless communication between actors regardless of physical location, simplifying the development of robust distributed systems in Go without external dependencies.
