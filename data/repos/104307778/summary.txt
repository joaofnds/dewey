The Ergo Framework is a Go-based implementation of the actor model and network transparency concepts from the Erlang world, designed for creating scalable, fault-tolerant, and distributed event-driven architecture. It offers core features such as actor communication, network transparency, built-in observability, ready-to-use actors, support for distributed systems, reliability, and flexibility. The framework simplifies the development of complex and distributed solutions by providing components like clustering, remote actor spawning, and distributed events. It is a flexible and powerful tool for developers working on event-driven microservices architecture in the domain of distributed systems.
