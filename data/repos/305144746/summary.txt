`tinygrad` is a Python-based deep learning framework designed to be a lightweight alternative to PyTorch, offering both inference and training capabilities. Its core functionality centers on providing an autograd/tensor library, supporting neural network construction with an optimizer and data loading. Key features include support for LLaMA and Stable Diffusion models, and the use of lazy evaluation for optimized kernel fusion. The framework supports diverse hardware accelerators, including GPU (OpenCL), CPU (C Code), LLVM, METAL, CUDA, and others, making it easily extensible for new devices; it is a library targeting machine learning practitioners and researchers.
