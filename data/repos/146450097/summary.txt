This repository provides accompanying source code for the book "Istio in Action," focusing on demonstrating and explaining the functionalities of the Istio service mesh. The project showcases practical examples and configuration files organized by chapter, alongside shared service definitions within a `services` directory. Primarily implemented in Shell scripts, the project serves as an example/template and educational resource for users seeking to understand and implement Istio, a service mesh technology primarily used in cloud-native application development.
