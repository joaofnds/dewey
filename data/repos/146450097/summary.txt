This repository contains source code examples for the "Istio in Action" book, serving as a practical learning resource for implementing Istio service mesh technology. It targets DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and backend developers working with microservices architectures in Kubernetes environments. The codebase demonstrates Istio's core capabilities including traffic management, security policies, observability, and service-to-service communication patterns through hands-on examples organized by book chapters. Built primarily with Shell scripts and YAML configurations, it addresses the complexity of managing microservices communication, implementing zero-trust security, and gaining operational visibility in distributed systems. The repository provides reusable service definitions and step-by-step implementation guides for production-ready service mesh deployments.
