This JavaScript repository, `json2csv`, provides a library for converting JSON data into CSV format. Originally a single package, it has been superseded by a modular design, broken into independent NPM packages for different use cases, including `plainjs`, `Node`, `WHATWG`, `CLI`, `Transforms`, and `Formatters`. It includes APIs for parsing, transforming, and formatting JSON data streams, targeting developers needing data conversion functionality, particularly in backend or data processing contexts. The library supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing within Node.js, web browsers, and Deno environments, with a command-line interface (CLI) available for standalone use.
