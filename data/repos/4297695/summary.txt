This JavaScript library provides data transformation utilities for converting JSON data structures to CSV format with configurable column headers. Targeting web developers and data engineers working with data export/import workflows, it offers multiple API variants including streaming parsers, Node.js transforms, WHATWG streams, and CLI interfaces. The modular architecture supports various JavaScript environments (browser, Node.js, Deno) and includes built-in data transformers and formatters for handling complex JSON-to-CSV mapping scenarios. Originally maintained as a monolithic package, it has evolved into a collection of specialized NPM packages addressing specific use cases in data processing pipelines, reporting systems, and file format conversion workflows where structured JSON data needs to be exported to tabular CSV format for spreadsheet applications or data analysis tools.
