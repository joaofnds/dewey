The `tldr-pages` project is a community-driven collection of concise help pages (cheatsheets) for command-line tools, designed as a simpler alternative to traditional man pages. It provides practical examples for various Unix-like operating systems including Linux, macOS, and Windows, offering readily accessible usage information for a wide range of console commands. Users interact with the project through command-line clients (Node.js, Python, Rust), or a web interface, enabling quick reference and simplified command lookup. The project is primarily a Markdown-based documentation repository with a focus on developer productivity, facilitating easier command-line usage.
