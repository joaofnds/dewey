tldr-pages is a collaborative documentation repository that provides simplified, example-driven cheat sheets for command-line tools across Unix, Linux, macOS, BSD variants, Android, and Windows platforms. Written primarily in Markdown, it serves as a practical alternative to traditional man pages by offering concise, real-world usage examples for shell commands and terminal utilities. The project targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, software developers, and command-line users who need quick reference materials for tools like tar, lsof, grep, and other console applications. Multiple client implementations are available in Node.js, Python, and Rust, enabling integration into various development workflows. The repository addresses the complexity and verbosity of standard Unix manual pages by focusing on common use cases and practical command syntax, making command-line tools more accessible to both novice and experienced users in systems administration and software development contexts.
