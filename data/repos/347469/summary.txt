`cl-redis` is a Common Lisp library providing a fast and robust client for interacting with Redis, a key-value data store. The library facilitates connecting to a Redis server, executing Redis commands, and handling responses. Key features include connection management, PubSub support, pipelining for improved performance, and error recovery mechanisms with restarts. The project is a library leveraging `usocket`, `flexi-streams`, and `rutils` for network communication and data handling and targets Common Lisp developers needing to integrate their applications with Redis.
