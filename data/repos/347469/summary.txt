CL-REDIS is a Common Lisp client library for Redis, the in-memory data structure store, designed for backend developers building distributed systems and web applications. The library provides comprehensive Redis command support through two packages (REDIS and RED) with connection management, error handling with automatic reconnection, and advanced features like pipelining for performance optimization and PubSub messaging patterns. It handles Redis protocol communication via usocket and flexi-streams, offering debugging capabilities and robust error recovery mechanisms. The client targets Common Lisp developers who need reliable Redis integration for caching, session management, real-time messaging, and data persistence in enterprise applications, providing both low-level command access and high-level abstractions for production deployment scenarios.
