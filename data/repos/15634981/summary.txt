Godot Engine is a multi-platform, open-source game engine written in C++ designed for developing both 2D and 3D games. It provides a unified interface and comprehensive tools for game creation, supporting one-click export to major desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile (Android, iOS), web, and console platforms. This standalone application offers features for game asset management, scripting, and scene design, allowing developers to build games without needing to develop the underlying engine functionality. It's a community-driven project, offering extensive documentation and resources for game developers.
