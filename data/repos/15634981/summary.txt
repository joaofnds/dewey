Godot Engine is an open-source, cross-platform game engine written in C++ that provides a unified development environment for creating 2D and 3D games across multiple platforms including desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile (Android, iOS), web, and console platforms. The engine targets game developers and indie studios in the game development industry, offering a comprehensive suite of tools including scene management, physics simulation, rendering pipelines, scripting support, and asset management to eliminate the need for developers to build core engine functionality from scratch. Licensed under MIT, Godot addresses the primary challenge of multi-platform game deployment by enabling one-click export to various target platforms while providing a feature-complete development toolkit that competes with commercial game engines, making professional game development accessible to independent developers and small studios.
