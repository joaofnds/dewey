Copilot.el is an unofficial Emacs plugin that integrates GitHub Copilot's AI-powered code completion capabilities into the Emacs text editor environment. Built in Emacs Lisp, it leverages Microsoft's official @github/copilot-language-server (requiring Node.js 22+) to provide real-time code suggestions and completions directly within Emacs buffers. The plugin targets software developers across various programming domains who prefer Emacs as their primary development environment and want to incorporate AI-assisted coding workflows. It supports Emacs 27+ and integrates with popular Emacs distributions like Doom Emacs and Spacemacs, offering configurable keybindings for accepting completions, word-by-word acceptance, and cycling through suggestions. The plugin addresses the gap between GitHub Copilot's web-based and VS Code integrations and the Emacs ecosystem, enabling developers to maintain their preferred editor while accessing modern AI coding assistance.
