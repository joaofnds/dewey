This repository serves as a curated educational resource collection for software developers across all skill levels and technology stacks. It aggregates fundamental computer science concepts, algorithms, data structures, and system design knowledge that transcends specific programming languages or frameworks. The content spans core technical domains including distributed systems, floating-point arithmetic, Unicode/string handling, memory management, latency optimization, regular expressions, networking protocols, databases, security principles, and software architecture patterns. Resources include academic papers, books, interactive visualizations, and practical guides covering topics from Big O notation and TCP/IP to cryptography and caching strategies. The repository targets professional software developers, computer science students, and engineers seeking to strengthen their foundational knowledge in systems programming, backend development, and distributed computing rather than focusing on any particular technology stack or development specialization.
