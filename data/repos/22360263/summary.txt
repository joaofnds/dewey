Itertools is a Rust library that extends the standard library's iterator functionality with additional adaptors, methods, and macros for advanced iterator manipulation and processing. Targeting Rust developers across domains including systems programming, data processing, and general application development, it provides combinatorial functions, grouping operations, batching utilities, and specialized iteration patterns that enhance functional programming capabilities. The library solves the problem of limited built-in iterator operations in Rust's standard library by offering tools like cartesian products, permutations, chunk processing, and advanced filtering/mapping operations. It serves as a foundational utility for Rust developers who need sophisticated data transformation and collection processing capabilities beyond basic map/filter/reduce operations, particularly useful in algorithmic programming, data analysis pipelines, and performance-critical applications requiring efficient iterator chains.
