The `hashicorp/go-retryablehttp` library is a Go HTTP client wrapper that implements automatic request retries with exponential backoff for handling transient network failures and server errors. Built as a thin layer over Go's standard `net/http` package, it automatically retries requests on connection errors and 5xx HTTP response codes (except 501), while maintaining API compatibility with the standard library. The library addresses the common web development challenge of handling unreliable network conditions and temporary service outages in distributed systems and microservices architectures. It supports request body rewinding for POST/PUT operations and can be converted to a standard `*http.Client` for seamless integration. Target users include backend developers, DevOps engineers, and system architects building resilient HTTP-based services and API clients in Go applications.
