This Go repository, `hashicorp/go-retryablehttp`, offers a retryable HTTP client that provides automatic retries and exponential backoff for web development tasks. The core features include handling connection errors, performing retries on 500-range response codes (except 501), and supporting request body provision in various efficient ways to enable "rewinding" the request body if the initial request fails. It is a lightweight library that wraps around the standard `net/http` client library, making it easy to integrate into existing programs. The project requires Go 1.12+ (version 0.6.1 onward) and later Go 1.13+ (from version 0.6.7 onward). This library is particularly useful for developers working with web APIs who need to handle network errors or timeouts gracefully, ensuring their applications maintain high availability.
