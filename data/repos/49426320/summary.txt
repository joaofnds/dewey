Carp is a statically typed Lisp programming language designed for real-time applications, particularly in domains like game development and sound synthesis, prioritizing performance and deterministic memory management. It features automatic memory management without a garbage collector, inferred static types for speed, and ownership tracking to enable functional programming paradigms while allowing mutation of cache-friendly data structures. This project is a programming language implementation written in Haskell, offering Lisp macros, compile-time scripting, and a REPL, enabling straightforward integration with C code, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.
