Helm is a Kubernetes package manager facilitating the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters. It utilizes "Charts," which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, enabling users to find, share, and reproducibly build and manage applications within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Built in Go, Helm provides a command-line interface for interacting with Kubernetes, rendering templates, and managing releases of packaged applications. This standalone application streamlines the deployment and lifecycle management of applications, targeting Kubernetes users and operators.
