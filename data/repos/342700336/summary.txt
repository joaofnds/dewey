`valita` is a TypeScript library providing type-safe validation and parsing for structured data. It offers a Zod-inspired API for defining schemas, enabling the validation of primitive and composite types, including objects, arrays, tuples, and unions. Key functionalities include parsing with optional modes, custom validators and parsers via `assert`, `map`, and `chain` methods, and type inference. This library is designed as a developer productivity tool, specifically a validation library, leveraging TypeScript's type system to improve code safety and data integrity.
