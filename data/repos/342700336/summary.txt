Valita is a TypeScript validation and parsing library designed for web development and Node.js applications that provides runtime type safety for untrusted input data. Built for JavaScript/TypeScript developers working across Node.js, Deno, and Bun environments, it offers a Zod-inspired API with optimized performance similar to simple-runtypes. The library focuses on input validation at application boundaries, supporting primitive types, object validation, union types, arrays, and custom validators with comprehensive error handling. It addresses the critical problem of ensuring data integrity when parsing JSON APIs, user inputs, or external data sources by providing compile-time TypeScript types coupled with runtime validation, featuring parsing modes (strict/strip/passthrough) and extensible custom validation logic for complex data transformation scenarios.
