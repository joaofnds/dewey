Hy is a Python-embedded Lisp dialect, enabling Lisp programming within the Python ecosystem. It compiles Lisp code into Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), granting access to Python's libraries and functionalities. This project functions as a Python-based compiler and language implementation, providing a read-eval-print loop (REPL) and command-line interface for running Hy programs. The project is primarily a library and development tool targeting developers who want to leverage Lisp syntax and metaprogramming capabilities within a Python environment.
