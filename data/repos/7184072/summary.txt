Hy is a Lisp dialect compiler that transpiles Lisp syntax into Python Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) objects, enabling developers to write Python programs using Lisp's parenthetical syntax and functional programming paradigms. The project targets Python developers and functional programming enthusiasts who want to leverage Lisp's metaprogramming capabilities, macro system, and homoiconic code structure while maintaining full access to Python's ecosystem including libraries, frameworks, and runtime environment. Built entirely in Python, Hy serves as both a compiler and REPL interpreter, allowing seamless interoperability between Lisp-style code and existing Python codebases. This addresses the use case of developers seeking Lisp's expressive power for domain-specific languages, code generation, and advanced metaprogramming tasks within Python's practical application domains including web development, data science, and general software development.
