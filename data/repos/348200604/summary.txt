The cutefishos/core repository provides essential system backend components and session management for the CutefishOS Linux desktop environment. Built with C++ and Qt5, it implements core desktop infrastructure including session initialization, system service management, and window system integration. The codebase heavily utilizes X11/XCB protocols for low-level display server communication, Polkit for privilege escalation and authentication, and KDE Frameworks (KWindowSystem, KIdleTime) for desktop integration. This system-level software targets Linux distribution developers and desktop environment maintainers who need foundational components for building a complete desktop experience. The extensive XCB dependencies indicate deep integration with X Window System protocols for graphics, input handling, and window management functionality essential for desktop operation.
