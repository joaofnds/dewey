This repository implements a deep learning framework for automated restoration of degraded historical photographs using PyTorch and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The system addresses the computer vision problem of old photo restoration by employing a multi-stage pipeline that detects and removes scratches, enhances facial features, and performs global image restoration through deep latent space translation. Built for researchers and computer vision practitioners, the framework combines face detection using dlib landmarks, synchronized batch normalization, and specialized GAN architectures to handle various degradation types including scratches, noise, and color deterioration. The codebase supports both CPU and GPU inference, handles high-resolution inputs, and provides pre-trained models for immediate deployment, targeting applications in digital heritage preservation and image processing workflows.
