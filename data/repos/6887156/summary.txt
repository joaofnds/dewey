`indentLine` is a Vim plugin designed to visually represent indentation levels within code files using thin vertical lines. Implemented in Vim Script, it leverages Vim's `conceal` feature to display these lines, specifically targeting code indented with spaces. Core functionalities include customizable color and character options for the lines, as well as the ability to toggle the feature on and off. This plugin provides features to change conceal behavior, and also includes font patching via `indentLine-dotted-guide.eps` for more refined appearance, and is designed to improve developer's visual code readability within the Vim editor.
