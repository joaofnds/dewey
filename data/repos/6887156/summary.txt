IndentLine is a Vim plugin that enhances code readability by displaying thin vertical lines at each indentation level for space-indented code. Built specifically for Vim 7.3+ using Vim Script, it leverages Vim's `conceal` feature to render indent guides as visual overlays without modifying the actual file content. The plugin targets software developers across all programming domains who use Vim as their primary editor and work with indented code structures. It addresses the common problem of tracking code block hierarchy and nested structures in languages like Python, JavaScript, HTML, and configuration files. The plugin offers extensive customization options including character selection (ASCII or Unicode symbols like │, ┆, ▏), color schemes, and conceal behavior configuration, making it particularly valuable for developers who frequently navigate complex, deeply-nested codebases and need visual assistance for maintaining proper code structure and readability.
