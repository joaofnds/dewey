Asynqmon is a TypeScript-based web monitoring dashboard for the Asynq task queue system, targeting backend developers and DevOps engineers working with Go-based distributed systems. It provides real-time visualization and administration capabilities for Redis-backed asynchronous job queues, offering both a standalone binary and an embeddable Go library for integration into existing web applications. The tool supports comprehensive Redis deployment scenarios including single instances, Sentinel, and cluster configurations, while integrating with Prometheus for time-series metrics collection and visualization. Asynqmon addresses the operational need for monitoring task queue health, job status tracking, and queue administration in microservice architectures, enabling developers to debug failed jobs, monitor queue performance, and manage task lifecycle through an intuitive web interface with features like dark mode and read-only operational modes.
