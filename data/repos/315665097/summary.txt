Asynqmon is a web UI application designed for monitoring and administration of Asynq task queues, a background job processing library. Built with TypeScript, it provides a visual interface for inspecting queues, tasks, and their metrics, and integrates with Prometheus for time-series data visualization.  The project functions as both a standalone binary and a library, allowing integration into existing Go web applications using frameworks like `net/http`, `gorilla/mux`, and `labstack/echo`. It leverages Go for backend functionality and is intended for developers using Asynq to manage and monitor their task queues.
