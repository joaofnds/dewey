validator.js is a comprehensive JavaScript library for string validation and sanitization, primarily targeting web developers building client-side and server-side applications. The library provides over 90 validation functions for common data formats including emails, URLs, credit cards, IP addresses, dates, phone numbers, and various locale-specific patterns, along with sanitization utilities for cleaning user input. Built for both Node.js and browser environments with support for ES6 imports, CommonJS, and AMD modules, it addresses the critical security and data integrity challenges in web development by standardizing input validation across applications. The library is framework-agnostic and operates exclusively on strings, making it suitable for form validation, API input processing, and data cleaning tasks in any JavaScript-based web application or service.
