Stats is a macOS system monitoring application built in Swift that provides real-time hardware and system metrics through menu bar widgets. Targeting system administrators, power users, and Mac enthusiasts, it monitors CPU/GPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, battery status, thermal sensors, fan speeds, and Bluetooth devices. The application leverages macOS system APIs and SMC (System Management Controller) interfaces to gather low-level hardware telemetry data, presenting it through customizable menu bar interfaces with detailed popup views. It addresses the need for comprehensive system visibility on macOS without requiring terminal-based monitoring tools, offering granular control over which metrics to display while optimizing for minimal system resource consumption.
