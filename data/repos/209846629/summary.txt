The `hashicorp/vault-action` repository provides a GitHub Action written in JavaScript designed to securely retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault and inject them as environment variables or outputs within GitHub Actions workflows. Its core function is to simplify the integration of Vault secrets into build and deployment processes, allowing users to authenticate via multiple methods including JWT with GitHub OIDC tokens, AppRole, Token, GitHub, and more. The action supports key syntax for specifying secrets and offers features like output variable renaming, multiple secret retrieval, and support for KV secrets engine version 2. It primarily targets developers and DevOps engineers utilizing HashiCorp Vault for secrets management within their CI/CD pipelines and integrates with the GitHub Actions ecosystem for enhanced security and automation. It is a developer productivity tool and a plugin/extension for the GitHub Action's platform.
