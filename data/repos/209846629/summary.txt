This repository provides a GitHub Action for integrating HashiCorp Vault secrets management into CI/CD pipelines, targeting DevOps and platform engineering teams. Built in JavaScript, it enables secure retrieval of secrets from Vault instances during GitHub Actions workflows, supporting multiple authentication methods including JWT with GitHub OIDC tokens, AppRole, Token, Kubernetes, and LDAP. The action addresses the critical problem of securely accessing production secrets in automated build and deployment processes without hardcoding sensitive credentials in repositories. It supports various Vault secret engines (KV v1/v2, database, AWS, etc.), automatic secret masking in logs, and flexible output formats as environment variables or step outputs. The tool is designed for system administrators and DevOps engineers implementing infrastructure-as-code practices with HashiCorp Vault as their centralized secrets management solution.
