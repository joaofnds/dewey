`grosser/parallel_tests` is a Ruby library designed to accelerate test execution. It parallelizes test runs for RSpec, Test::Unit, and Cucumber test suites, effectively doubling testing speed on systems with two CPUs. This developer productivity tool focuses on reducing test suite runtime, a common bottleneck in Ruby projects. As a library, it integrates into existing Ruby testing environments.
