`vue-loader` is a Webpack loader facilitating the use of Vue.js Single-File Components (SFCs). Its core functionality involves transforming Vue SFCs, enabling features like scoped CSS, hot-reloading, and the integration of various webpack loaders for `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style>` blocks (e.g., Sass, Pug). The loader leverages `@vue/compiler-sfc` for parsing and utilizes a plugin to inject necessary loaders, like template and style post-processors, into the webpack build process. This TypeScript-based project acts as a crucial plugin for Vue.js frontend developers, enhancing the development workflow by providing a modular and efficient way to author Vue components within a Webpack environment.
