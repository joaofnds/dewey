vue-loader is a specialized webpack loader for Vue.js web development that enables Single-File Component (SFC) processing. It parses .vue files containing template, script, and style blocks into separate virtual modules, applying appropriate webpack loaders to each block (e.g., Sass for styles, TypeScript for scripts). The loader integrates with @vue/compiler-sfc for parsing and supports advanced features like scoped CSS, hot module replacement, custom elements mode, and Vue Reactivity Transform. It solves the core problem of bundling Vue components in webpack-based build pipelines, allowing frontend developers to author modular Vue applications using the SFC format while leveraging webpack's ecosystem of loaders and plugins for asset processing and optimization.
