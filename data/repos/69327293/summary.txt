Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL) is a conforming ANSI X3J13 Common Lisp implementation that runs on the Java Virtual Machine, targeting functional programming and symbolic computation domains. The system compiles Lisp source code directly to JVM bytecode, enabling seamless interoperability between Common Lisp and Java ecosystems. Built with Java 8/11/17 support and distributed via Maven/Ant build systems, ABCL bridges traditional AI/research computing paradigms with modern JVM infrastructure. It serves Lisp developers, AI researchers, and symbolic computation specialists who need to integrate Lisp-based algorithms with Java applications or deploy Lisp code in JVM-centric enterprise environments, providing REPL-driven development with containerized deployment options.
