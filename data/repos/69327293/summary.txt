Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL) is a Common Lisp implementation, leveraging the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for execution. This project provides a bridge between Common Lisp and the JVM, enabling the compilation of Common Lisp code into JVM bytecode.  Key functionalities include implementation of the ANSI Common Lisp standard (ANSI-X3J13), with a focus on leveraging the JVM for interoperability.  ABCL serves as a Common Lisp environment for developers seeking to utilize the JVM platform.
