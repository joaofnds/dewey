i3 is a tiling window manager implementation for X11-based Unix-like systems, written in C and targeting Linux and BSD environments. It serves the desktop environment and system administration domain by providing an alternative window management paradigm that automatically arranges application windows in non-overlapping tiles rather than traditional floating windows. The project directly interfaces with X11 protocols to manage window positioning, workspace organization, and user input handling through keyboard-driven navigation. It addresses the productivity needs of developers, system administrators, and power users who require efficient screen real estate utilization and rapid window switching without mouse dependency, particularly in multi-monitor development environments and server administration workflows.
