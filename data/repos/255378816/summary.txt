htmx is a JavaScript library enabling the development of modern web user interfaces directly in HTML by leveraging AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets, and Server Sent Events through HTML attributes. It aims to extend the capabilities of HTML as a hypertext language, removing constraints on HTTP requests and event triggers, and allowing for the construction of dynamic, interactive web applications with reduced JavaScript. This small, dependency-free library facilitates client-side interactions by making asynchronous requests and content updates more accessible within HTML, targeting frontend developers seeking an alternative to traditional JavaScript-heavy approaches for building web applications.
