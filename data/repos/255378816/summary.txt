htmx is a JavaScript library for web development that extends HTML's native capabilities by enabling AJAX, WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, and CSS transitions through declarative HTML attributes. It targets frontend developers building modern web applications who want to create dynamic user interfaces without complex JavaScript frameworks. The library implements HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) principles and RESTful architecture patterns, allowing any HTML element to trigger HTTP requests beyond the standard GET/POST methods available to anchor tags and forms. At ~14KB minified and dependency-free, htmx addresses the problem of JavaScript framework complexity by letting developers build interactive web applications using primarily server-side rendering with enhanced HTML, making it particularly suitable for teams preferring backend-heavy architectures while still delivering responsive user experiences.
