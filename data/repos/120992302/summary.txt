mutt-wizard is a shell-based automation tool for configuring terminal email clients, specifically targeting system administrators and power users who prefer command-line email workflows. It automatically configures neomutt, isync, and msmtp by detecting IMAP/SMTP server settings, generating appropriate dotfiles, and securely storing credentials using GPG encryption via the pass password manager. The wizard supports multiple email accounts (up to nine), creates offline mail storage with synchronization capabilities, and integrates with additional tools like notmuch for indexing and abook for contact management. It solves the complex manual configuration problem inherent in terminal-based email setups, enabling users to quickly deploy a full-featured offline email client with proper security practices and automated mail synchronization through cron jobs.
