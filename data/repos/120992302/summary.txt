`mutt-wizard` is a shell script-based command-line application designed to automate the configuration of the `neomutt` email client, along with `isync` and `msmtp`, for managing multiple email accounts securely on a terminal. It determines server settings, generates configuration files, encrypts passwords using `pass`, and provides utilities for account management, mail synchronization, and optional features like push notifications and address book integration. The project functions as a standalone application leveraging `neomutt`, `isync`, `msmtp`, and `pass` as core dependencies, targeting users seeking a terminal-based email client with automated setup and secure password management.
