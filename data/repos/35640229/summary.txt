Rollup is a JavaScript module bundler designed for web development that compiles ES modules into optimized bundles for browsers and Node.js environments. It performs static analysis and tree-shaking to eliminate unused code, reducing bundle size while supporting multiple output formats including CommonJS, AMD, UMD, and IIFE. The tool enables developers to write modern ES module syntax while maintaining compatibility with legacy environments that don't natively support ES modules. Rollup targets frontend developers and library authors who need efficient bundling solutions for JavaScript applications and libraries, offering both CLI and programmatic APIs for integration into build workflows and supporting the transition from older module systems to standardized ES modules.
