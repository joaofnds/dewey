Katana is a high-performance web crawling and spidering framework written in Go, designed for cybersecurity professionals and penetration testers conducting automated reconnaissance and attack surface mapping. The tool operates in both standard HTTP and headless browser modes, leveraging JavaScript parsing capabilities to crawl modern single-page applications and extract endpoints, forms, and URL structures from target websites. It features configurable scope control, automatic form filling, custom header injection, and proxy support for stealth operations. Built as a CLI tool with JSON/STDOUT output formats, Katana integrates into security automation pipelines for bug bounty hunting, vulnerability assessment, and red team engagements. The framework addresses the challenge of comprehensively mapping web application attack surfaces, particularly JavaScript-heavy applications that traditional crawlers cannot adequately process.
