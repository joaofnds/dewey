Sapling SCM is a Git-compatible distributed version control system built in Rust, designed for enterprise-scale software development environments. The system addresses scalability limitations in massive repositories containing millions of files and commits through a three-component architecture: the `sl` CLI client (derived from Mercurial), Mononoke distributed server backend, and EdenFS virtual filesystem for on-demand file loading. It targets software development teams and DevOps workflows requiring high-performance source control operations that scale with developer usage rather than repository size. The implementation includes a web-based Interactive Smartlog UI built with Node.js/Yarn, VS Code integration, and cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows), solving performance bottlenecks in large-scale software development where traditional Git workflows become inefficient due to repository size constraints.
