`facebook/sapling` is a cross-platform source control system designed for extreme scalability and user-friendliness, aiming to manage very large repositories. Written in Rust, it provides a Git-compatible CLI (`sl`) and a web-based Interactive Smartlog (ISL) for repository visualization and interaction. The system comprises the client, a server-side Mononoke component (currently unsupported externally), and EdenFS, a virtual filesystem optimized for fast checkouts in large repositories by on-demand file population. This standalone application targets software developers dealing with large codebases, offering a performant alternative to existing source control systems.
