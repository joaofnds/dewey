vramfs is a Linux filesystem utility that creates FUSE-based storage volumes using graphics card VRAM instead of system RAM. Built in C++ with OpenCL 1.2 integration, it allocates GPU memory as mountable filesystem blocks, achieving ~2.4 GB/s read and 2.0 GB/s write performance through asynchronous buffer operations. The system implements standard filesystem operations (stat, readdir, write) by mapping file I/O to OpenCL buffer commands, managing VRAM blocks via shared_ptr pools and maintaining filesystem metadata through entry objects (file_t, dir_t, symlink_t). Targeted at system administrators and performance enthusiasts, vramfs addresses scenarios where abundant GPU memory can supplement storage performance, particularly on systems with 4GB+ discrete graphics cards where VRAM utilization is suboptimal.
