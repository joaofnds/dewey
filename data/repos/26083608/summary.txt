`vramfs` is a C++ utility and standalone application that implements a file system within the video RAM (VRAM) of a graphics card using the FUSE library. This project aims to utilize otherwise unused VRAM, providing a RAM-disk-like functionality for faster read/write operations compared to traditional storage. Key features include the ability to mount a VRAM-based file system, manage file and directory entries, and leverage OpenCL for data manipulation within the VRAM.  The architecture uses a user-space file system built with FUSE, interacting with OpenCL to allocate and manage memory buffers on the GPU.
