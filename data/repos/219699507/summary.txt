`kmon` is a Rust-based, terminal user interface (TUI) application designed for managing and monitoring Linux kernel activities and modules. It allows users to load, unload, blacklist, and display information about kernel modules, alongside real-time monitoring of kernel messages. Utilizing libraries like Ratatui and termion for its TUI, `kmon` provides features such as module searching, options menu for module management, customizable colors, and keybindings for navigation and control. This standalone CLI application targets system administrators and Linux users seeking a consolidated tool for kernel module management and system monitoring.
