kmon is a Linux kernel management and monitoring tool built in Rust that provides a terminal user interface (TUI) for system administrators and Linux power users to interact with kernel modules and monitor kernel activities. The application targets the Linux system administration and DevOps domain, offering real-time kernel module management capabilities including loading, unloading, and monitoring of Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs). Built using Rust's systems programming capabilities with TUI libraries, kmon addresses the need for an intuitive interface to manage kernel components without requiring complex command-line operations or kernel recompilation. It serves system administrators, DevOps engineers, and Linux enthusiasts who need to monitor kernel state, manage device drivers, and troubleshoot kernel-level issues through a unified dashboard interface.
