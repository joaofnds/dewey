`xan` is a high-performance command-line CSV/TSV processing tool written in Rust, designed for data manipulation and analysis workflows. It targets data scientists, researchers, and analysts working with large tabular datasets, particularly in social sciences and web data collection contexts. The tool provides multithreaded processing capabilities for filtering, joining, aggregating, sorting, and transforming CSV files at scale, handling gigabyte-sized datasets efficiently. It features a custom expression language optimized for CSV operations, built-in terminal-based data visualization (histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps), and specialized utilities for lexicometry and graph theory analysis. Originally forked from `xsv` but extensively rewritten, `xan` serves as a comprehensive data processing pipeline alternative to traditional scripting approaches, offering composable commands for complex data transformations without the overhead of interpreted languages like Python or JavaScript.
