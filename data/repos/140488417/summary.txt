`xan` is a high-performance command-line tool for processing CSV files written in Rust. It excels in handling large CSV files (Gigabytes) with minimal memory usage and leverages parallelism for efficient task completion. The tool offers a wide range of composable commands, including previewing, filtering, slicing, aggregating, sorting, joining, and more. It also features an expression language tailored for CSV data, making it faster than typical dynamically-typed languages like Python, Lua, or JavaScript.

Beyond basic data manipulation, `xan` offers utilities related to lexicometry, graph theory, and scraping, making it a valuable tool for web data collection and analysis in the social sciences domain. It can display CSV files in the terminal for easy exploration and even generate basic data visualizations such as scatterplots, histograms, and heatmaps.

The tool is primarily designed for researchers, data analysts, and developers working with large CSV datasets, particularly those in the web development or social sciences fields. It can be installed using various methods, including Cargo (Rust's package manager), Scoop (Windows), Homebrew (macOS), Arch Linux, Nix, or pre-built binaries.
