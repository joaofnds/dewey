Rack::Attack is a Ruby middleware library designed for web application security and abuse prevention in the Rack ecosystem, including Rails applications. It provides developers with a flexible framework to implement rate limiting, request throttling, and IP-based blocking/safelisting to protect web applications from malicious clients, DDoS attacks, and API abuse. The middleware integrates seamlessly into the Rack request/response cycle, offering rule-based configuration for defining custom blocking logic, fail2ban-style progressive penalties, and request tracking. It supports various cache stores for maintaining throttling state and provides instrumentation capabilities for monitoring. Target users are Ruby web developers and DevOps engineers managing Rails or Rack-based applications who need to implement application-layer security controls without relying solely on infrastructure-level protection, making it particularly valuable for API providers and high-traffic web applications requiring granular abuse prevention mechanisms.
