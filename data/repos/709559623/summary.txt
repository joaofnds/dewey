tardis.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides git history navigation functionality, allowing developers to traverse through different revisions of a file directly within their editor buffer. The plugin targets software developers working in version-controlled codebases, particularly those using git repositories within the Neovim ecosystem. It implements a time-travel interface inspired by Emacs' git-timemachine, enabling users to scroll through commit history, view revision messages, and replace current buffer contents with historical versions using configurable keymaps. Built on the plenary.nvim dependency for Lua utilities, the plugin addresses the common developer workflow of examining file evolution over time without leaving the editor context, supporting up to 256 revisions with an initial load of 10 revisions for performance optimization.
