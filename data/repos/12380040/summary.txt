Medley is a lightweight utility library for Clojure and ClojureScript that provides a curated collection of general-purpose functions missing from clojure.core. Targeting Clojure developers across various domains including web development, data processing, and general application development, it fills functional programming gaps with pure functions for common operations like collection manipulation, map transformations, and data structure utilities. The library maintains compatibility with both JVM Clojure (1.7.0+) and ClojureScript environments using reader conditionals, positioning itself as a focused alternative to broader utility libraries like flatland/useful or Plumbing. It solves the recurring problem of developers reimplementing common helper functions by providing a standardized, well-tested set of utilities that integrate seamlessly with idiomatic Clojure codebases.
