Medley is a lightweight Clojure and ClojureScript utility library providing a curated set of *mostly* pure functions. It addresses the need for general-purpose functions that are "missing" from `clojure.core`, focusing on a small, focused set of functionalities. Installation is achieved via a `deps.edn` or Leiningen dependency declaration. The library's API documentation is available online, indicating its role as a developer productivity tool for Clojure developers.
