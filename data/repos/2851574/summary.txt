Merit is a Ruby gem that implements a comprehensive reputation system for Ruby on Rails web applications, providing badges, points, and rankings functionality. Targeted at Rails developers building community-driven platforms, social networks, or gamified applications, it offers a declarative DSL for defining reputation rules based on controller actions and model conditions. The gem integrates deeply with Rails conventions, using ActiveRecord for persistence, supporting automatic badge granting through configurable triggers, temporary/permanent badge states, and multi-level scoring systems. Merit addresses the common need for user engagement mechanics in web applications by providing a plug-and-play reputation engine that tracks user achievements, calculates point systems, and maintains leaderboards without requiring custom implementation of these complex behavioral tracking systems.
