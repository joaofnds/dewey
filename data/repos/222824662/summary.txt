Dagger is an open-source runtime environment written in Go for composing and executing containerized workflows, primarily targeting CI/CD pipelines and AI agent applications. It enables the creation of repeatable, modular, and cross-platform workflows with features including containerized execution, a universal type system for connecting components, automatic artifact caching, and built-in observability with tracing and metrics. This project functions as a standalone application offering a command-line interface (CLI) and supports integration with LLMs for function discovery, providing an interactive terminal for workflow interaction and debugging.
