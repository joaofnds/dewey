Dagger is an open-source workflow orchestration runtime built in Go that enables containerized, composable workflow execution for CI/CD pipelines and AI agent systems. It targets DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and AI developers by providing a universal type system that allows cross-language component integration with type-safe connections. The platform leverages Docker containers, GraphQL APIs, and DAG-based workflow execution with automatic artifact caching and built-in observability through tracing and metrics. Dagger addresses the core problem of creating reproducible, modular workflows across heterogeneous technology stacks while providing native LLM integration for AI agent development. It operates as a platform-agnostic runtime that transforms code into cacheable, immutable operations with parallel processing capabilities and cross-platform support.
