This repository implements a JSON parser entirely within TypeScript's type system, leveraging advanced type-level programming techniques to parse JSON strings at compile-time rather than runtime. Built for the web development domain, it demonstrates TypeScript's Turing-complete type system capabilities by performing string parsing, tokenization, and object construction through conditional types, template literal types, and recursive type definitions. The parser transforms JSON string literals into properly typed TypeScript objects during compilation, enabling compile-time JSON validation and type inference. Despite its novel approach to meta-programming and type-level computation, the repository explicitly warns against production use due to performance implications and complexity. It primarily serves TypeScript developers interested in advanced type system exploration, compiler theory, and pushing the boundaries of static analysis rather than solving practical JSON parsing needs.
