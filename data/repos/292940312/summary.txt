This repository provides a JSON parser implemented entirely within TypeScript's type system. It enables compile-time JSON parsing, allowing for type inference based on JSON structures. This project functions as a library, demonstrating the capabilities of TypeScript's type system for static analysis and potentially providing a unique perspective on JSON processing. The primary technology is TypeScript, utilized to build a parser for JSON documents.
