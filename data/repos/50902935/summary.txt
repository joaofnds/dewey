xclip is a command-line utility written in C that provides programmatic access to X11 selection buffers (clipboard system) on Unix-like systems. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and power users working in X Window System environments, it enables shell scripts and command-line workflows to interact with the desktop clipboard by reading from stdin/files and writing to X selections (XA_PRIMARY, XA_SECONDARY, XA_CLIPBOARD). The tool supports INCR mechanism for large data transfers, integrates with terminal-based editors like vim, and includes companion utilities for file operations across networked X11 sessions. It solves the fundamental problem of bridging command-line tools with graphical desktop clipboard functionality, essential for automation scripts and terminal-centric workflows in Linux desktop environments.
