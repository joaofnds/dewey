`xclip` is a standalone command-line interface application written in C, providing access and manipulation of the X11 clipboard. Its core functionality allows users to copy text *to* and *from* the X11 clipboard directly from the command line, enabling integration with other command-line tools and scripting. This tool acts as a bridge, facilitating interactions between the user's shell environment and the X11 clipboard system. System administrators and developers who frequently interact with the X11 desktop environment are the primary intended users.
