PCP is a Clojure-based application processor designed as a lightweight replacement for PHP, facilitating the deployment of multiple websites on a single server instance. It provides a CLI for project management, secret handling, and local server execution, along with a daemon service running on port 9000 that processes Clojure scripts, offering features like HTML generation with Hiccup, request handling based on the Ring specification, and caching for performance optimization. Utilizing Clojure, and leveraging libraries like Garden for CSS and hiccup for HTML rendering, PCP enables developers to create dynamic web pages and deploy them with nginx. This is a standalone web application framework.
