PCP (Clojure Processor) is a web development framework that enables server-side scripting using Clojure as a direct replacement for PHP in traditional LAMP-style deployments. Built with Clojure and designed for nginx integration, it provides a PHP-like execution model where individual .clj files are processed per HTTP request, supporting multiple websites on shared hosting environments. The system includes a GraalVM-compiled CLI utility for project management and a background service that handles script execution with features like encrypted secrets management, caching via pcp/persist, and Ring-spec compliant request/response handling. Targeted at web developers seeking cost-effective hosting solutions, PCP addresses the deployment complexity of traditional Clojure web applications by mimicking PHP's simple file-based execution model while maintaining Clojure's functional programming benefits for small to medium-traffic websites.
