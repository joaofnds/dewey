This repository contains educational materials from a structured Vim editor training course taught at BuffaloLab, designed to help developers master advanced text editing workflows. The content consists of progressive class notes and accompanying YouTube video tutorials that cover Vim installation, core editing commands, modal operations, and expert-level techniques for efficient code manipulation. Targeting software developers, system administrators, and technical professionals who need to perform intensive text editing tasks in terminal environments, the curriculum addresses the steep learning curve associated with Vim's modal interface and command-based navigation. The materials focus on practical skill development for developers working in Unix/Linux environments, DevOps workflows, and remote server administration where GUI text editors are unavailable, ultimately solving productivity bottlenecks in command-line development environments.
