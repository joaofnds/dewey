RedwoodGraphQL is a full-stack JavaScript/TypeScript web application framework designed for rapid React-based application development in the JAMStack domain. It provides an opinionated architecture combining a React frontend with a custom GraphQL API layer, utilizing Prisma for database operations and Apollo for GraphQL implementation. The framework targets web developers building data-driven applications, offering integrated tooling including Jest for testing, Pino for logging, and Storybook for component development. RedwoodGraphQL solves the technology decision paralysis problem by providing a cohesive, pre-configured stack that supports deployment to both serverless platforms (Netlify, Vercel) and traditional server environments, enabling developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure configuration and technology integration.
