Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management (IAM) server built in Java that provides centralized authentication and authorization services for modern web applications and microservices. It implements industry-standard protocols including OpenID Connect (OIDC) and SAML to enable single sign-on (SSO), user federation, multi-factor authentication, and fine-grained authorization policies. The platform eliminates the need for developers to implement custom authentication systems by offering a comprehensive IAM solution with user management, role-based access control, and integration capabilities for enterprise identity providers. Targeting enterprise developers, system administrators, and DevOps teams, Keycloak addresses the complex challenge of securing distributed applications while maintaining centralized identity governance across cloud-native and traditional deployment environments.
