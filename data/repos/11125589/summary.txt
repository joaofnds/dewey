Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution written in Java, designed to secure modern applications and services. It provides functionalities including user federation, strong authentication, user management, and fine-grained authorization, supporting standards like OIDC and SAML. As a standalone server application, Keycloak allows developers to easily add authentication and authorization to their applications, removing the need to handle user storage and authentication directly. The project incorporates a web-based user interface and a command line interface for administrative tasks, with strong community support, including documentation and mailing lists.
