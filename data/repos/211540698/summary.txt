KMonad is a cross-platform keyboard management tool written in Haskell that provides advanced keyboard customization capabilities typically found in QMK-firmware enabled keyboards to any standard keyboard through low-level system manipulation. It targets power users, developers, and keyboard enthusiasts who need sophisticated input remapping features including multi-layered keymaps, tap-hold functionality, multi-tap sequences, and command execution bindings. The tool operates at the system level on Linux, Windows, and macOS, intercepting and transforming keyboard input events to implement features like home-row modifiers, custom layouts (Colemak, Dvorak), and context-sensitive key behaviors. KMonad solves the problem of hardware-limited keyboard functionality by implementing firmware-level features in software, enabling users to transform standard keyboards into highly customizable input devices without requiring specialized hardware or firmware modifications.
