This repository provides a streamlined deployment solution for a private Vaultwarden instance on the Fly.io platform, enabling users to easily host their own password manager service. The deployment utilizes a `deploy.sh` script and Docker, streamlining the setup process with a focus on ease of use.  It is a shell script-based example/template project that facilitates the quick deployment of a pre-existing application (Vaultwarden), making it accessible via the Fly.io cloud infrastructure. The project targets users who want to self-host a password management solution with minimal configuration effort.
