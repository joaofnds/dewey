This repository provides a deployment automation script for self-hosting Vaultwarden, an unofficial Bitwarden password manager server implementation, on the Fly.io cloud platform. Targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators, it uses Shell scripting, Docker containerization, and flyctl CLI to streamline the deployment process of a private password management service. The solution addresses the need for organizations and individuals to maintain control over their password vault data by hosting their own Bitwarden-compatible server rather than relying on cloud services. The automated deployment script handles infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, and credential generation, with admin interface support for user management through email invitations, making enterprise password management self-hosting accessible without complex manual setup procedures.
