`docker.el` is an Emacs Lisp package providing comprehensive integration with Docker, enabling users to manage Docker containers, images, volumes, networks, and contexts directly from within the Emacs environment. It facilitates common Docker operations, including container management (start, stop, rm, etc.), image handling (pull, run, inspect), and docker-compose support. Key functionalities include interactive listing and selection of resources, customizable keybindings for actions, and support for `vterm` integration for interactive container sessions. This project is a plugin/extension designed for Emacs users and developers who actively utilize Docker for containerization and development workflows.
