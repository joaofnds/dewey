docker.el is an Emacs Lisp package that provides comprehensive Docker management capabilities directly within the Emacs editor environment. Built using Emacs transient framework and tablist for UI components, it enables DevOps engineers and developers to manage Docker containers, images, volumes, networks, contexts, and docker-compose services without leaving their development environment. The package implements a tabular interface for listing and manipulating Docker resources, supports common Docker operations (run, stop, inspect, logs, exec), integrates with Emacs TRAMP for remote file access inside containers, and provides customizable keybindings and workflows. It targets system administrators and developers who prefer terminal-based workflows and want to consolidate their container orchestration tasks within their primary text editor, eliminating context switching between Emacs and separate Docker CLI tools.
