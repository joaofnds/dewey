`parinfer-rust-mode` provides a developer productivity tool specifically for writing Lisp code within the Emacs editor. This project enhances the Lisp coding experience, potentially simplifying code formatting and structure based on the Parinfer methodology (implied by the name). Built as an Emacs Lisp mode, it integrates directly with the Emacs environment, offering a specific plugin to improve Lisp code editing workflows. Its primary function is to assist users writing Lisp code, likely by automatically adjusting indentation, and formatting to match the Parinfer style.
