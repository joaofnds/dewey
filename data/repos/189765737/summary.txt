parinfer-rust-mode is an Emacs minor mode that provides intelligent parentheses management for Lisp programming languages including Clojure, Emacs Lisp, and Scheme. Built as an Emacs Lisp wrapper around the parinfer-rust native library, it automatically balances parentheses based on indentation patterns and vice versa, operating in three modes: paren (manual parentheses control), indent (automatic parentheses inference), and smart (structure preservation). The package targets Lisp developers who want to reduce the cognitive overhead of managing nested expressions by leveraging Emacs' dynamic module system to interface with a high-performance Rust backend. It addresses the fundamental challenge in Lisp development of maintaining proper parenthetical structure while editing code, eliminating the need for manual bracket counting and paredit-style keybindings through intelligent formatting automation.
