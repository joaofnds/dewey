Ledger is a command-line double-entry accounting system implemented in C++ that processes plain-text financial transaction files to generate comprehensive financial reports. Targeting the plaintext accounting domain, it serves accountants, finance professionals, and technically-minded individuals who prefer text-based workflows over GUI applications. The system leverages C++ for performance with dependencies including Boost libraries, GMP/MPFR for arbitrary precision arithmetic, CMake for build management, and optional Python integration for advanced features. Ledger solves the problem of maintaining detailed financial records and generating complex reports without requiring proprietary accounting software or databases, operating entirely on human-readable text files that can be version-controlled and scripted, making it ideal for users who value data portability, automation, and programmatic access to their financial data.
