This repository serves as a curated collection of critical articles and blog posts documenting perceived flaws and limitations in the Go programming language (Golang). Targeting software developers evaluating Go adoption, it aggregates community complaints spanning from 2009-2020 covering technical issues like lack of generics, error handling patterns, dependency management (GOPATH), absence of exceptions, limited OOP support, and toolchain immaturity. The repository functions as a reference resource for developers in web development, systems programming, and backend engineering who need to assess Go's trade-offs before implementation. Each entry catalogs specific technical grievances including syntax design, standard library limitations, IDE support, and language feature gaps, providing developers with consolidated negative feedback to inform technology selection decisions across various software development domains.
