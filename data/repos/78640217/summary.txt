This repository provides comprehensive quickstart examples for integrating Keycloak, an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution, across multiple programming languages and frameworks. Targeting web developers and security engineers, it demonstrates securing applications using OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect protocols through practical examples organized by technology stack: Jakarta EE, JavaScript, Node.js, and Spring Framework. The repository includes both client-side authentication implementations and server extension examples using Keycloak's Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs). These working code samples serve as reference implementations for developers implementing authentication and authorization in enterprise web applications, addressing the core problem of securing modern applications and services with standardized identity management patterns across diverse technical environments.
