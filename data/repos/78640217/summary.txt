This repository, `keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts`, provides example implementations demonstrating how to secure applications using Keycloak, an open-source Identity and Access Management solution. These quickstarts, written primarily in Java, showcase integration with various programming languages and frameworks including Jakarta, JavaScript, NodeJS, and Spring, along with examples for extending Keycloak server capabilities via Java-based Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs). Organized by category, the examples serve as reference implementations for developers integrating Keycloak into their projects, with building and testing instructions provided for each quickstart. This is a set of example projects, targeting developers looking to secure their applications using Keycloak.
