Hertz is a high-performance HTTP framework written in Go, specifically designed for building microservices in production environments. Built by ByteDance (CloudWeGo), it leverages the custom Netpoll network library and supports HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and ALPN protocols with pluggable network layer switching between Netpoll and Go's standard net library. The framework targets backend developers building scalable web services and APIs, offering middleware support, data binding, routing, and observability features. Hertz addresses performance bottlenecks in microservice architectures by providing lower latency and higher QPS compared to standard Go HTTP implementations, while maintaining extensibility through its layered architecture and comprehensive plugin ecosystem for logging, monitoring, and protocol extensions.
