Underdash is a JavaScript utility library providing a collection of functional programming snippets for array and object manipulation, targeting web developers who need lightweight alternatives to larger libraries like Lodash. Built with vanilla JavaScript, it offers modular utility functions for common collection operations such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and data transformation tasks. The library addresses the problem of bundle size optimization in modern web development by providing granular, tree-shakeable utility functions that can be selectively imported rather than including entire utility libraries. Frontend developers working on performance-critical applications, particularly those using modern JavaScript frameworks and build tools like Webpack or Rollup, can leverage these snippets to implement functional programming patterns while maintaining minimal bundle overhead for collection manipulation tasks.
