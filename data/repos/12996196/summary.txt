Gobot is a Go-based robotics and IoT framework designed for physical computing applications involving hardware devices and embedded systems. It provides a unified API for controlling diverse hardware platforms including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, Intel Edison, and specialized devices like Sphero drones through various communication protocols (GPIO, I2C, Bluetooth, MQTT). The framework supports three usage patterns: "Classic" robot-centric architecture with connection/device abstractions, "Metal" direct hardware control using pure Go, and "Manager" mode for orchestrating multiple robots with built-in API servers. It targets robotics engineers, IoT developers, and hardware enthusiasts who need cross-platform hardware abstraction in Go, enabling rapid prototyping and deployment of robotic systems, drone control applications, and IoT solutions across different embedded platforms and microcontrollers.
