RuboCop is a Ruby static code analyzer and formatter that enforces coding standards based on the community Ruby Style Guide. Targeting Ruby web developers and application teams, it performs automated code linting to detect style violations, code smells, and potential bugs in Ruby codebases (supporting Ruby 2.0+ analysis on MRI 2.7+ and JRuby 9.4+ runtimes). The tool provides automatic code formatting capabilities and integrates into development workflows through CLI, bundler, and LSP server support for editors. RuboCop addresses code quality and consistency challenges in Ruby development by scanning source code against configurable rules, reporting violations, and applying automated fixes, enabling development teams to maintain uniform coding standards across projects and improve code maintainability.
