Plaid is a 4x12 ortholinear mechanical keyboard hardware project targeting electronics enthusiasts and custom keyboard builders. The design exclusively uses through-hole electronic components for DIY assembly accessibility, featuring an ATmega328p microcontroller with V-USB implementation for USB connectivity. The keyboard runs QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware, providing programmable key mapping and macro functionality. This project addresses the maker community's need for beginner-friendly keyboard kits that can be assembled without surface-mount soldering skills, while maintaining full programmability through the established QMK ecosystem. The repository serves hardware hackers, mechanical keyboard enthusiasts, and DIY electronics hobbyists seeking an educational soldering project with practical daily-use applications.
