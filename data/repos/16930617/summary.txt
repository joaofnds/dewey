andlabs/ui is a cross-platform GUI library for Go that provides native desktop application development capabilities by wrapping platform-specific UI frameworks. Built as a Go binding for the libui C library, it enables developers to create desktop applications with native look-and-feel across Windows (using Win32 API), macOS (using Cocoa), and Linux (using GTK+ 3.10+). The library requires cgo and targets desktop application developers who need to build cross-platform GUI software in Go without web-based frameworks like Electron. It handles platform-specific requirements including Windows manifests for Common Controls v6 and macOS execution behaviors, solving the problem of creating truly native desktop applications in Go while maintaining a single codebase across operating systems.
