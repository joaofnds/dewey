The `andlabs/ui` repository provides a platform-native GUI library for Go, enabling cross-platform GUI software development. It abstracts platform-specific GUI elements via bindings to underlying system GUI toolkits like GTK+ on Unix-like systems and native Windows UI elements, while leveraging cgo. As a library, it offers functionalities for building graphical user interfaces in Go applications, including providing Windows manifest support. The project is currently in mid-alpha, targeting Go developers who need to create native desktop applications and requires Go 1.8 or newer along with platform-specific dependencies like GTK+ and cgo.
