Effection is a TypeScript library that implements structured concurrency and algebraic effects for JavaScript runtime environments, targeting web developers working with asynchronous operations across Node.js, browsers, and Deno platforms. The library addresses resource leakage and improper cancellation handling in concurrent JavaScript code by providing a task runner system that enforces structured concurrency principles, ensuring automatic cleanup of effects and resources. Built with Deno as the primary development toolchain and distributed via npm and deno.land, Effection serves JavaScript/TypeScript developers who need robust concurrent programming patterns beyond traditional async/await mechanisms. The library focuses on effects management and provides deterministic task lifecycle control for building scalable asynchronous applications with guaranteed resource cleanup and proper cancellation propagation.
