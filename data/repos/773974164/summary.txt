Sudo-Flix is a TypeScript-based streaming web application built with React and TailwindCSS that provides a frontend interface for accessing multimedia content through aggregated streaming sources. The project operates as a client-side application targeting web developers and self-hosting enthusiasts who want to deploy personal streaming instances. It implements a microservices architecture connecting to separate backend APIs, proxy services, and browser extensions for content discovery and playback functionality. The codebase uses modern web development tooling including Vite for bundling and pnpm for package management, designed for easy local development and deployment. Target users are developers comfortable with Node.js environments who want to host their own streaming platform instances rather than rely on centralized services.
