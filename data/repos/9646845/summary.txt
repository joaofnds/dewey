go-pg is a PostgreSQL-focused Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library and database client for Go developers building web applications and backend services. It provides high-performance database operations with comprehensive support for PostgreSQL-specific features including JSONB, Hstore, multidimensional arrays, composite types, and LISTEN/NOTIFY notifications. The library offers both ORM-style model operations and raw SQL query execution, featuring automatic connection pooling with circuit breaker patterns, prepared statements, transactions, bulk operations, and upsert functionality via INSERT...ON CONFLICT. Designed for Go backend developers requiring robust PostgreSQL integration, it handles type marshaling, null value management, query timeouts, and connection retry logic. Currently in maintenance mode with development shifted to the multi-database Bun ORM successor.
