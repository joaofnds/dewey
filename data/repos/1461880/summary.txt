This repository provides XML and HTML parsing libraries for Common Lisp applications, converting HTML documents into *lhtml* format and XML documents into *lxml* format - both represented as nested Lisp list structures. Designed for web development and document processing workflows, it enables Common Lisp developers to parse, manipulate, and generate HTML/XML content programmatically. The HTML parser integrates with AllegroServe's htmlgen package for bidirectional HTML conversion, while the XML parser offers non-validating XML processing. Primary use cases include web scraping, content management systems, and document transformation pipelines where developers need to process markup languages within Lisp-based applications, particularly those using Allegro Common Lisp environments.
