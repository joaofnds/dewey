`xmlutils` is a Common Lisp library providing XML and HTML parsing functionalities. It includes an HTML parser that converts HTML to *lhtml* format, and an XML parser that converts XML to *lxml*. The XML parser is considered at end-of-life, with the documentation recommending the use of the SAX module within Allegro Common Lisp for XML parsing. This project serves as a library for parsing XML and HTML documents, targeting Common Lisp developers working with structured data.
