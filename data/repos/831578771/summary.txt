**"Clay" is a high-performance C UI layout library, offering microsecond layout performance and a flex-box like model for complex, responsive 2D layouts. Its core features include text wrapping, scrolling containers, aspect ratio scaling, and a single ~4k LOC header file with zero dependencies. The library supports WebAssembly (Wasm) compilation for browser use, static arena based memory allocation, and a React-like nested declarative syntax. Notably, it outputs a sorted list of rendering primitives that can be easily composited in any 3D engine, making it renderer agnostic.**
