Clay is a high-performance 2D UI layout library written in C for building graphical user interfaces across multiple platforms. Targeting UI/UX developers and game engine programmers, it provides a flexbox-like layout system with microsecond-level performance using static arena-based memory allocation without malloc/free dependencies. The library outputs renderer-agnostic draw commands that can be integrated into 3D engines, web browsers via WebAssembly compilation, or native applications. Clay solves immediate-mode GUI layout challenges by offering React-like declarative syntax while maintaining zero external dependencies in a single 4KB header file. It supports responsive layouts, text wrapping, scrolling containers, and aspect ratio scaling, making it suitable for performance-critical applications like game development, embedded systems, and cross-platform desktop applications where traditional UI frameworks are too heavyweight.
