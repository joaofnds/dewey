`rx` is a minimalist pixel art editor implemented in Rust, targeting game developers and digital artists working with retro/8-bit graphics. Built with OpenGL 3.3 for hardware-accelerated rendering, it provides a command-line interface with vim-like commands (`:help`) and extensible architecture for pixel-perfect image editing. The application addresses the need for modern tooling in pixel art creation, particularly for gamedev workflows requiring precise control over individual pixels in sprite and animation development. Designed for pixel artists, animators, and indie game developers who need efficient tools for creating retro-style graphics, it combines modern Rust performance with specialized features for low-resolution art creation, filling the niche between heavyweight image editors and simple drawing tools in the game development pipeline.
