**PacGo** is an educational game development project that implements a terminal-based Pac-Man clone in Go, designed as a programming tutorial for learning the Go language. The project targets beginner to intermediate Go developers and educators in the game development and programming education domains. It demonstrates core Go concepts including concurrency, input/output handling, terminal manipulation, pointers, and game loop architecture through a step-by-step tutorial format. The application uses ANSI escape sequences for terminal rendering, emoji characters for game graphics, and implements classic arcade game mechanics like player movement, collision detection, and real-time input processing. The repository serves as both a functional retro-style terminal game and a comprehensive educational resource, with multiple conference presentations and structured learning modules that progressively build game functionality while teaching Go programming fundamentals.
