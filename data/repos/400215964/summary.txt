Novu is an open-source notification infrastructure platform built in TypeScript for web and mobile application developers. It provides a unified API and embeddable React components to manage multi-channel notifications including email, SMS, push notifications, in-app messaging, and chat integrations (Slack, Discord, Teams). The platform features a workflow engine for notification orchestration, digest capabilities for batching messages, and supports 40+ provider integrations including SendGrid, Twilio, FCM, and AWS SNS. Developers can embed real-time notification centers and user preference components into React applications while managing notification logic through a centralized dashboard. The monorepo architecture includes Node.js backend services, React frontend components, and provider-specific modules, targeting full-stack developers building modern web applications that require sophisticated notification delivery across multiple channels.
