Marqueeo is an Emacs Lisp package that implements a novelty extension for the Emacs text editor, displaying an animated Mario character within the header line interface element. Built using Emacs Lisp's display and animation capabilities, it leverages Emacs' header-line-format customization system to render pixel art graphics in the editor's UI chrome. This package targets Emacs users and developers who want to personalize their development environment with retro gaming aesthetics. The primary use case is entertainment and editor customization rather than productivity enhancement, solving the problem of static, utilitarian header lines by adding animated visual elements. It demonstrates advanced Emacs Lisp programming techniques for UI manipulation and serves the developer tools/text editor customization domain.
