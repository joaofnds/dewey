Saka Key is a cross-browser web extension for Chrome and Firefox that provides keyboard-driven web navigation, eliminating the need for mouse interaction during browsing. Built with JavaScript and web extension APIs, it targets web users who prefer vim-like keyboard shortcuts for productivity enhancement. The extension implements link hints, scrolling controls, tab management, and other browser navigation features through configurable key bindings. It addresses the productivity domain by solving the inefficiency of mouse-dependent web browsing, particularly appealing to developers, power users, and accessibility-conscious individuals who value keyboard-centric workflows. The project uses standard web extension architecture with separate builds for Chrome and Firefox platforms, following patterns established by similar tools like Vimium and cVim in the browser automation space.
