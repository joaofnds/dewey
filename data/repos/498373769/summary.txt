Grafana Phlare, now archived, was a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant continuous profiling aggregation system. Built in Go, its primary function was to collect and analyze performance profiles. The system leveraged technologies and concepts from the monitoring and performance-monitoring domains, integrating with tools like Prometheus and targeting Kubernetes environments. This standalone application enabled continuous profiling, crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing applications.
