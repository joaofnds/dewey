Grafana Phlare was a horizontally-scalable, multi-tenant continuous profiling aggregation system built in Go for DevOps and performance monitoring domains. It provided centralized collection, storage, and analysis of application performance profiles across distributed systems, enabling developers and SRE teams to identify performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and CPU hotspots in production environments. The system integrated with Kubernetes deployments and Prometheus monitoring infrastructure, offering high availability and horizontal scaling capabilities for enterprise-scale profiling data ingestion. Target users included platform engineers, site reliability engineers, and performance optimization teams requiring persistent profiling data storage and querying capabilities. The project has been archived and merged into Grafana Pyroscope following Grafana Labs' acquisition of the Pyroscope profiling platform in March 2023.
