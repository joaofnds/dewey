This GitHub repository, imputnet/cobalt, presents a media downloader application built using Svelte, focusing on efficiency, user-friendliness, and privacy. The core functionality allows users to paste links and download files from various social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, SoundCloud, Vimeo, and more. The application is ad-free, tracker-free, and does not cache content, working like a proxy for efficient downloads. This monorepo includes source code for the API, frontend, and related packages, along with documentation on running an instance, protecting it, and using its API. The project is licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. It's important to note that cobalt is not a piracy tool and can only download free and publicly accessible content.
