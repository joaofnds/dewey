**cobalt** is a web-based media downloader application built with Svelte/TypeScript that extracts and serves publicly accessible content from major social media platforms including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, SoundCloud, Vimeo, and VK. The monorepo contains a REST API backend for content extraction and stream proxying, plus a frontend web application, targeting end-users who need efficient media downloading without ads or paywalls. The system functions as a proxy service that processes URLs and returns downloadable media files without caching content locally, serving the digital content consumption and archival domain for general internet users rather than developers.
