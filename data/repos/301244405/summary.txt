Atuin is a standalone CLI application written in Rust that replaces the default shell history with a SQLite database, enhancing command line usability and discoverability. It provides a full-screen search UI accessible via `ctrl-r` and `up`, and records additional context such as exit codes, command duration, and current working directory. Key features include encrypted history synchronization across machines via a hosted or self-hosted server, improved search functionality with filters, and support for common shells like Bash, Zsh, and Fish. This project is a developer productivity tool primarily targeting shell users who need more advanced history management and synchronization capabilities.
