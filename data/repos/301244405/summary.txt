Atuin is a Rust-based shell history replacement tool that targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and command-line power users. It replaces traditional shell history mechanisms (bash, zsh, fish, nushell, xonsh) with a SQLite database backend that captures enhanced command metadata including exit codes, execution duration, working directory, hostname, and session context. The system provides advanced search capabilities with filtering by time, exit status, and directory, along with a full-screen TUI for interactive history browsing. Atuin implements optional end-to-end encrypted synchronization across multiple machines via a self-hostable server component, solving the problem of fragmented and limited shell history across development environments. The tool integrates with existing shell workflows through configurable keybindings and maintains compatibility with traditional history files.
