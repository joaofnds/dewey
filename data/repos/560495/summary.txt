JSDoc is a command-line API documentation generator specifically designed for JavaScript codebases, targeting web developers and JavaScript engineers who need to create comprehensive technical documentation from source code comments. Built in Node.js, it parses specially-formatted JSDoc comments within JavaScript files to automatically generate HTML documentation websites, supporting modern JavaScript features and various output formats. The tool addresses the critical need for maintaining up-to-date API documentation in JavaScript projects by extracting type information, parameter descriptions, and usage examples directly from code annotations. It integrates seamlessly into JavaScript development workflows through npm installation, supports customizable templates, and works with popular build tools like Grunt and Gulp, making it essential infrastructure for JavaScript library maintainers and development teams.
