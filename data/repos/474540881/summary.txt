Nixpacks is a containerization tool written in Rust that automatically builds OCI-compliant Docker images from application source code by combining Nix package management with Docker containerization. Targeting the DevOps and cloud deployment domain, it serves as an alternative to Cloud Native Buildpacks, specifically designed to address deployment challenges encountered by Railway's platform when containerizing diverse user applications. The tool leverages the Nix ecosystem for system and language dependency resolution, providing a CLI interface that analyzes source directories and generates deployable container images. Primary users include platform engineers, DevOps teams, and developers seeking automated containerization workflows that avoid the complexity and limitations of traditional buildpack implementations while maintaining reproducible builds through Nix's declarative package management approach.
