Nixpacks is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that builds OCI-compliant Docker images from application source code. It leverages the Nix package manager and nixpkgs to manage system and language dependencies, differentiating itself from traditional Buildpacks. Written in Rust, Nixpacks simplifies application deployment by abstracting away build and dependency management, targeting developers seeking a streamlined image creation process for various deployment platforms. The project functions as a standalone application.
