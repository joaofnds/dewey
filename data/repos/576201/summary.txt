Three.js is a comprehensive JavaScript 3D graphics library designed for web developers building interactive 3D applications in browsers. It abstracts WebGL, WebGL2, and WebGPU APIs to provide a simplified interface for creating 3D scenes, managing geometries, materials, lighting, cameras, and animations without requiring low-level graphics programming knowledge. The library targets web development domains including data visualization, gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR/WebXR), architectural visualization, and interactive multimedia applications. It supports multiple rendering backends including WebGL/WebGL2 for GPU-accelerated 3D graphics, with additional SVG and CSS3D renderers for specific use cases. Three.js solves the complexity barrier of 3D web development by providing a scene graph architecture and high-level APIs that enable front-end developers to create sophisticated 3D experiences using familiar JavaScript patterns and modern web standards.
