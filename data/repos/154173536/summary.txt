Planify is a GNOME-native task management application built in Vala that provides offline-first productivity workflows with cloud synchronization capabilities. The application integrates with Todoist API and Nextcloud via CalDAV protocol, enabling cross-platform task synchronization while maintaining local SQLite storage for offline functionality. Built using GTK4, libadwaita, and the Meson build system, it leverages GNOME ecosystem libraries including Evolution Data Server for calendar integration, WebKitGTK for web content rendering, and libportal for desktop integration. The application targets Linux desktop users seeking a native alternative to web-based task managers, offering features like drag-and-drop task organization, project progress tracking, reminder notifications, and recurring task scheduling while adhering to GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and supporting both light and dark themes.
