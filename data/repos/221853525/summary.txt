Cockatiel is a TypeScript resilience and fault-handling library for Node.js applications, providing enterprise-grade patterns for managing transient failures in distributed systems. It implements core reliability patterns including retry policies with configurable backoff strategies, circuit breakers for preventing cascade failures, timeouts, bulkhead isolation for resource management, and fallback mechanisms. The library supports cancellation tokens, event-driven monitoring, and policy composition through wrapping, targeting backend developers and DevOps engineers building microservices, API integrations, and database-dependent applications. Inspired by .NET's Polly library, it addresses the JavaScript ecosystem's need for comprehensive fault tolerance without external dependencies, enabling developers to handle network failures, service unavailability, and resource contention in production environments.
