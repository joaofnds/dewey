`connor4312/cockatiel` is a TypeScript library designed for building resilient and fault-tolerant applications, specifically within the Node.js environment. It provides critical fault-handling mechanisms, including backoff strategies, retry logic, circuit breaker patterns, timeouts, and bulkhead isolation.  The library supports cancellation tokens for asynchronous operations. This project targets developers seeking to improve the stability and reliability of their Node.js applications through robust error management and resource protection techniques.
