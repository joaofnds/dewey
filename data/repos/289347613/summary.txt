This repository contains Clojure programming katas focused on algorithmic problem-solving practice, specifically implementing prime factorization and bowling score calculation exercises. Built using the Leiningen build automation tool and the Speclj testing framework for behavior-driven development, it serves as a training ground for developers to practice test-driven development (TDD) methodologies and functional programming concepts. The katas target software developers seeking to improve their algorithmic thinking, Clojure proficiency, and unit testing skills through deliberate practice of classic coding challenges. The repository emphasizes the educational programming domain, providing structured exercises that help developers refine their problem decomposition abilities and master idiomatic Clojure syntax while following TDD principles with comprehensive test coverage.
