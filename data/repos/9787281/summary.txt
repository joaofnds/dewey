string-edit.el is an Emacs Lisp package that enables developers to edit string literals within code by opening them in separate buffers with automatic escape sequence handling. The tool addresses the complexity of managing escaped characters in multi-line strings, particularly targeting web developers working with HTML templates embedded in JavaScript code. When invoked via `string-edit-at-point`, it extracts string content to a dedicated buffer, removes escape sequences for direct editing, and provides specialized handling for JavaScript/HTML contexts including automatic HTML mode activation and multi-line string concatenation. The package integrates with Emacs' buffer management system and uses dash.el for functional programming utilities, solving the "escape nightmare" problem common in web development workflows where developers embed HTML markup within JavaScript string literals.
