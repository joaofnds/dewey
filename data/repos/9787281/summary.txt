`string-edit.el` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to facilitate the editing of strings within Emacs buffers by opening them in a separate buffer, thus avoiding escape character complexities. It allows users to call a function on a string in a buffer to open it for direct editing, then re-inserts the modified, unescaped content into the original string upon save. The package handles special cases, such as enabling HTML mode within the editing buffer when handling HTML templates in JavaScript code. This Emacs Lisp plugin relies on external dependencies, including `dash.el`, and is available via ELPA package managers like Marmalade and MELPA. It is aimed at Emacs users, particularly those working with strings that require frequent editing or complex escaping, especially in contexts like HTML templating within programming languages.
