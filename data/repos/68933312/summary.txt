postgres-decoderbufs is a PostgreSQL logical decoder output plugin written in C that captures database change events and serializes them as Protocol Buffers for the Debezium change data capture platform. It targets data engineering and real-time data integration use cases, enabling streaming of PostgreSQL database modifications (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to downstream systems like Apache Kafka. The plugin leverages PostgreSQL's logical replication slots and write-ahead log (WAL) streaming capabilities, with dependencies on protobuf-c for serialization and PostGIS for geometric data type support. It serves data engineers, platform engineers, and backend developers who need to implement event-driven architectures, maintain data synchronization across distributed systems, or build real-time analytics pipelines by capturing database changes as they occur.
