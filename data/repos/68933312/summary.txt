`postgres-decoderbufs` is a PostgreSQL output plugin for logical decoding that delivers database changes as Protocol Buffers, designed for use with the Debezium data streaming platform. Written in C, it facilitates data replication and change data capture (CDC) by translating PostgreSQL's write-ahead log (WAL) entries into a serialized binary format.  It integrates with PostgreSQL 9.6+ and depends on Protobuf-c and PostGIS for handling geometric data types, enabling the extraction and streaming of database events.  This plugin is a component of the Debezium ecosystem, targeting users needing to capture and stream database changes to other systems.
