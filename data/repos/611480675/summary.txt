`jonjohnsonjr/dagdotdev` is a Go-based web server that provides visual exploration and inspection capabilities for OCI (Open Container Initiative) registries and APK (Alpine Package Keeper) repositories. Built for the DevOps and container ecosystem, it serves as a registry browser allowing users to navigate and examine container images, layers, and package contents through a web interface. The application targets container platform engineers, DevOps practitioners, and system administrators who need to inspect OCI artifacts and Alpine packages. It leverages Go's container registry libraries, supports Google Cloud Run deployment with GCS caching, integrates OAuth for private registry access, and includes ambient credential support via keychain authentication. The tool addresses the need for human-readable exploration of container registries beyond basic CLI tools.
