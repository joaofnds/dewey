FerretDB is an open-source MongoDB-compatible database proxy written in Go that translates MongoDB wire protocol queries into SQL and executes them against PostgreSQL with Microsoft's DocumentDB extension. It serves as a drop-in replacement for MongoDB 5.0+, enabling applications using MongoDB drivers and tools to seamlessly operate with PostgreSQL as the underlying storage engine. The project targets backend developers and database administrators who need document database functionality without MongoDB's SSPL licensing restrictions. FerretDB maintains compatibility with existing MongoDB applications while leveraging PostgreSQL's mature ecosystem, addressing the need for an open-source document database solution in web development, enterprise applications, and commercial projects that require true open-source licensing.
