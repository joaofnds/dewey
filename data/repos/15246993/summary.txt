Shepherd.js is a JavaScript library for creating interactive user onboarding tours and guided walkthroughs in web applications. Built for frontend web development, it provides a framework-agnostic solution with specific wrappers for React, Angular, Vue.js, and Ember, as well as vanilla JavaScript support. The library generates contextual tooltips and step-by-step guidance overlays that highlight specific UI elements, enabling developers to implement digital adoption platforms (DAP) and user training flows. It addresses the common web development challenge of user onboarding and feature discovery by providing a lightweight, customizable tour system. Target users are frontend developers and web application teams who need to reduce user friction and improve feature adoption through guided experiences, with cross-browser compatibility across modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
