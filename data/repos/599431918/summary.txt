Oxc (Oxidation Compiler) is a high-performance JavaScript and TypeScript toolchain written in Rust, targeting web developers and JavaScript ecosystem maintainers. It provides a comprehensive suite of development tools including a conformant JS/TS parser with custom AST, linter with 430+ rules, minifier, formatter, transformer, and module resolver. The project addresses performance bottlenecks in JavaScript tooling by leveraging Rust's speed, delivering parsing and linting capabilities that are 50+ times faster than traditional Node.js-based tools like ESLint. Oxc serves both as standalone CLI tools (oxlint) and as Rust crates for building custom JavaScript development tools, with additional bindings for Node.js via NAPI and WebAssembly, making it suitable for integration into existing JavaScript build pipelines and development workflows.
