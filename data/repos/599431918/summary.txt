`oxc-project/oxc` is a Rust-based collection of JavaScript and TypeScript tooling, including a high-performance parser, linter, minifier, resolver, formatter, and transformer. The project focuses on developer productivity by providing fast, production-ready tools for JavaScript, with a particular emphasis on speed advantages over existing solutions like ESLint. It functions as a library of individual crates that are published, alongside CLI tools like `oxlint`. The project's architecture emphasizes performance through memory arena allocation and multi-threading, and aims to be a complete alternative to existing JavaScript toolchains.
