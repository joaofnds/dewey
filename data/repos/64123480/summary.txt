Pharo is a dynamic, reflective object-oriented programming language and runtime environment derived from Smalltalk, designed for live programming and rapid application development. The repository contains the complete language implementation using a self-hosted architecture where the system is built from Smalltalk source code through a sophisticated bootstrapping process. It targets software developers building interactive applications, educational programming environments, and research prototypes requiring runtime code modification and introspection capabilities. The system combines language runtime, IDE, and debugging tools into a unified environment supporting both GUI and headless server deployments. Key technical features include automatic builds via Jenkins CI/CD, Tonel source format for version control, Docker containerization support, and separation of language implementation from virtual machine execution layer, making it suitable for developers needing immediate feedback loops and dynamic system modification during development.
