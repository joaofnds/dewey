This repository provides a pre-configured template for JavaScript/Node.js developers to implement automated semantic versioning and package publishing workflows in monorepo architectures. It combines Lerna for monorepo management, Yarn Workspaces for dependency handling, Conventional Commits for standardized commit messaging, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation to enable fully automated package releases to GitHub Package Registry. The template addresses the complex challenge of coordinating version bumps, changelog generation, and publishing across multiple interdependent packages within a single repository, targeting frontend and Node.js developers working with component libraries, shared utilities, or microservice architectures who need reliable automated release management without manual intervention.
