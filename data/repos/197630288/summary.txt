Jet is a command-line data transformation utility built in Clojure that enables bidirectional conversion between JSON, EDN, YAML, and Transit formats. Compiled as a GraalVM native binary for fast startup times, it targets DevOps engineers, backend developers, and data processing workflows requiring shell scripting integration. The tool provides functional data transformation capabilities through Clojure expressions, thread-first/thread-last operators, and includes Specter library support for complex data manipulation. Key features include streaming processing, keywordization of JSON/YAML keys, pretty printing with color output, and EDN reader customization. It addresses the common need for format conversion and data processing in API development, configuration management, and data pipeline tasks where jq-like functionality is required across multiple serialization formats beyond JSON.
