This repository provides example source code, likely for a Clojure application or project, as demonstrated by the build and execution commands, including uberjar generation. It showcases basic Clojure project structure and usage, including running tests, and builds a project with dependencies and build tasks via `build.clj`. The project uses `clojure-game-geek` as its name and generates a standalone executable. The primary domain is general software development, with an example of how to get a basic project built using Clojure's tools. This is an example project, likely intended for developers learning Clojure or as a template for new projects.
