This repository contains example source code for the Lacinia tutorial, serving as a practical demonstration of GraphQL API development in Clojure. Built on the Lacinia framework (Clojure's GraphQL implementation), it provides a hands-on learning resource for developers exploring GraphQL server development within the Clojure ecosystem. The project follows standard Clojure tooling conventions with deps.edn configuration and tools.build for project management, offering multiple execution patterns and testing workflows. Targeting Clojure developers interested in modern API development, it bridges functional programming concepts with GraphQL schema design and query resolution. The codebase serves as both educational material and a foundation for understanding how to implement GraphQL APIs using idiomatic Clojure practices and the Lacinia library's capabilities.
