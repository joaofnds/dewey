The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a software development framework for defining and provisioning cloud infrastructure as code using modern programming languages. It allows developers to define AWS resources imperatively through high-level constructs, which encapsulate AWS best practices. Supported languages include TypeScript, Python, Java, .NET, and Go, enabling the creation of reusable infrastructure components that are then deployed via AWS CloudFormation. This project is a framework, offering a command-line interface (CLI) for synthesizing, deploying, and diffing infrastructure changes, streamlining infrastructure-as-code workflows for AWS cloud environments.
