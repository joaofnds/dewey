The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) framework that enables developers to define and provision AWS cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages including TypeScript, Python, Java, .NET, and Go. Built primarily in TypeScript, it provides high-level object-oriented abstractions called "constructs" that encapsulate AWS resources and best practices, which are organized into stacks and deployed via AWS CloudFormation. The framework targets DevOps engineers, cloud architects, and full-stack developers who need to programmatically manage cloud infrastructure rather than using declarative YAML/JSON templates. CDK solves the complexity of AWS resource configuration by offering rich APIs through its Construct Library, enabling code reuse, testing, and version control of infrastructure definitions while maintaining the reliability of CloudFormation for actual resource provisioning.
