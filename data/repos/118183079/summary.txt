This repository, now archived, hosted the public-facing component of JSONSchema.Net, a web application designed to generate JSON schemas from JSON data based on the JSON Schema Validation specification. The application serves as a developer productivity tool, allowing users, particularly web and mobile app developers, to quickly create JSON schemas, thereby streamlining data validation processes within their applications. While the specific technology stack is not detailed, the project's core function revolves around facilitating the creation and utilization of JSON Schema, following specifications maintained at json-schema.org and offering benefits such as time savings and improved data integrity for JSON-based applications.
