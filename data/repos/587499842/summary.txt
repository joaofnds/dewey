Piper is a local neural text-to-speech (TTS) engine implemented in C++ that converts text input to audio output using VITS-trained voice models exported to ONNX format. Designed for speech synthesis applications and voice assistants, it targets the smart home automation and accessibility domains, with specific optimization for Raspberry Pi hardware. The system supports 40+ languages through downloadable ONNX model files and provides both command-line and Python API interfaces with streaming audio capabilities. Built for developers integrating TTS functionality into home automation systems, accessibility tools, and voice-enabled applications, Piper leverages onnxruntime for efficient inference and includes multi-speaker support, JSON input handling, and CUDA acceleration options for production deployments requiring fast, offline speech synthesis.
