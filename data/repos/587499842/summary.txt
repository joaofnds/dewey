**Repository Data:**

**Name:** rhasspy/piper

**Description:** A fast, local C++ neural text-to-speech (TTS) system optimized for the Raspberry Pi 4, featuring high-quality voices trained with VITS and exported to onnxruntime. The system supports a wide range of languages and is intended for text-to-speech research.

**Primary function and domain:** Solves the problem of generating natural-sounding speech from text in various languages, primarily within the Machine Learning (ML) domain.

**Core features and capabilities:** Users can synthesize speech from text using a variety of voices, each requiring an .onnx model file and a corresponding .onnx.json config file. The system is optimized for speed and performance on the Raspberry Pi 4.

**Technology stack:** C++, onnxruntime, VITS (for voice training).

**Project type:** Application.

**Requirements:** Users can run Piper with Python or download binary releases for different architectures, including amd64, arm64, and armv7. Building from source requires the piper-phonemize library.

**Target users:** Researchers, developers, and enthusiasts working on text-to-speech projects, particularly those focused on the Raspberry Pi platform.
