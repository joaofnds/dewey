Puter is an open-source web-based operating system built with JavaScript that provides a complete desktop environment accessible through web browsers. It serves the cloud computing and web development domains by offering a self-hostable alternative to traditional cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive, while functioning as a comprehensive web desktop platform. The system enables remote desktop capabilities, file management, application hosting, and serves as a development platform for web applications and games. Built on Node.js with Docker containerization support, Puter targets developers, system administrators, and organizations seeking privacy-first cloud solutions with desktop-like user interfaces. It addresses the need for browser-based operating systems that can be deployed on personal servers or used as hosted services, combining traditional desktop functionality with modern web technologies to create an "Internet OS" that runs entirely in web browsers while maintaining full desktop metaphors and workflows.
