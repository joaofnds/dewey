Puter is a JavaScript-based, open-source web operating system designed for self-hosting and cloud-based personal computing. It functions as a web-based desktop environment offering features such as cloud storage integration (akin to Dropbox), application hosting, and remote desktop access, accessible from any device. Built with JavaScript, it utilizes technologies like Node.js and npm for development, supports Docker and Docker Compose for deployment, and incorporates a GUI for user interaction. This project represents a standalone, web-based application targeting users seeking a privacy-focused, self-hosted alternative to commercial cloud services, and developers interested in building web applications within its ecosystem.
