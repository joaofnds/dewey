Seaborn is a Python statistical data visualization library that provides a high-level interface for creating sophisticated statistical graphics, built on top of matplotlib. Targeting data scientists, researchers, and analysts in the data science domain, it simplifies the creation of complex visualizations by offering intuitive APIs for common statistical plots like heatmaps, regression plots, distribution plots, and categorical data visualizations. The library integrates seamlessly with the scientific Python ecosystem, requiring numpy, pandas, and matplotlib as core dependencies, with optional scipy and statsmodels support for advanced statistical functionality. Seaborn addresses the problem of matplotlib's verbose syntax and limited statistical plotting capabilities by providing publication-ready visualizations with minimal code, automatic statistical computations, and attractive default styling optimized for exploratory data analysis and statistical reporting.
