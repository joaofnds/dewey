Torn is an open-source split mechanical keyboard design targeting the custom keyboard enthusiast community. Built around an Atmega328P microcontroller running QMK firmware with VUSB support, it features a 42-key columnar staggered layout inspired by popular keyboards like Corne and Plaid. The project provides complete hardware schematics, PCB designs created in KiCad, bill of materials, and comprehensive build documentation for through-hole component assembly. Compatible with VIA configuration software and featuring a custom USBaspLoader bootloader, Torn addresses the need for an accessible DIY split keyboard that can be hand-soldered by hobbyists. The repository includes 3D-printable case files, troubleshooting guides, and build instructions, serving keyboard enthusiasts, makers, and electronics hobbyists interested in ergonomic typing solutions and custom mechanical keyboard construction.
