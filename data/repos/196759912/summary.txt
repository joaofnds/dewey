This repository hosts the source code for 1x.engineer, a community-driven website that defines and celebrates "1x engineers" as an alternative to the "10x engineer" concept in software development culture. Built as a static website, it serves the software engineering community by providing a collaborative platform where developers can contribute traits and characteristics that represent realistic, sustainable engineering practices. The project targets software developers, engineering managers, and tech professionals seeking to promote inclusive and balanced workplace culture. Contributors can submit pull requests to add or refine traits describing 1x engineers, with the repository maintaining community standards through a code of conduct. The website includes GitHub-integrated badges for developers to display their 1x engineer status on personal projects, fostering community identity around practical, collaborative software development approaches.
