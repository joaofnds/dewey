The "reverse-interview" repository is a comprehensive knowledge base containing curated questions that technology job candidates should ask potential employers during interviews. This career resource targets software engineers, developers, and technical professionals across all domains including web development, DevOps, data science, and system administration. The repository provides structured question categories covering technical infrastructure (CI/CD, version control, testing practices), team dynamics, company culture, compensation, work-life balance, and career development opportunities. Available in over 20 languages with community-contributed translations, it serves as a practical guide for technical professionals to evaluate companies, identify red flags, and assess role fit during the interview process. The resource addresses the common problem of candidates not asking sufficient questions to properly evaluate potential employers and workplace environments.
