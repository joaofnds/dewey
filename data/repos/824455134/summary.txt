Pongo is a TypeScript library that provides a MongoDB-compatible API layer for PostgreSQL databases, targeting Node.js backend developers working with document-oriented data models. It translates MongoDB query syntax and operations (insertOne, updateOne, find, etc.) into native PostgreSQL JSONB queries, leveraging PostgreSQL's binary JSON storage for performance while maintaining ACID compliance. The library addresses the need for MongoDB-like document database functionality without MongoDB's consistency limitations or licensing concerns, allowing developers to use familiar MongoDB syntax while benefiting from PostgreSQL's reliability, advanced indexing capabilities, and ecosystem integration. Primary users are web application developers seeking document database flexibility with relational database guarantees in PostgreSQL-based infrastructures.
