Pongo is a TypeScript library designed to provide a MongoDB-compatible API for PostgreSQL, enabling developers to leverage PostgreSQL's strong consistency and advanced features. It allows users to interact with PostgreSQL as a document database by translating MongoDB syntax into native SQL queries utilizing PostgreSQL's JSONB support. The library facilitates operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and finding documents, mirroring core MongoDB functionality. Pongo's architecture is built on TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Node.js and provides a shim to allow use of the MongoDB API, thus allowing easier migration of existing projects to PostgreSQL.
