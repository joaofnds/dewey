Mutt is a terminal-based email client written in C, designed for Unix-like systems and targeted at system administrators, developers, and power users who prefer command-line interfaces. It provides a text-mode user interface for reading, composing, and managing email messages with support for multiple mailbox formats (mbox, Maildir, IMAP, POP3), MIME handling, and cryptographic operations through GnuPG integration. The application focuses on efficiency, keyboard-driven navigation, and extensive customization capabilities through configuration files, making it particularly suitable for users managing email on remote servers via SSH or those who prefer lightweight, scriptable email solutions without graphical dependencies. Mutt addresses the need for a fast, reliable email client in server environments and development workflows where GUI applications are impractical.
