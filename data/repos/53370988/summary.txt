Lighthouse is a comprehensive web performance auditing tool developed by Google Chrome that analyzes web applications and pages to measure modern performance metrics, accessibility compliance, SEO optimization, and Progressive Web App (PWA) best practices. Built in JavaScript for the Node.js ecosystem, it integrates directly into Chrome DevTools, operates as a Chrome extension, or runs via CLI/programmatic API for automated testing workflows. The tool leverages Chrome's debugging protocol to collect runtime performance data, network metrics, and DOM analysis while applying industry-standard web development audits across categories like Core Web Vitals, accessibility standards, and modern web practices. Primarily targeting web developers, performance engineers, and QA teams, Lighthouse serves as both a development-time diagnostic tool and CI/CD pipeline component for maintaining web application quality and user experience standards in enterprise web development workflows.
