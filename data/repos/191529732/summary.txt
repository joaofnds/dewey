This repository serves as a comprehensive JavaScript assessment and learning resource containing advanced JavaScript questions with detailed explanations. Targeted at web developers and frontend engineers, it covers core JavaScript concepts including hoisting, closures, event loops, async/await, prototypes, ES6+ features, and browser APIs. The repository addresses the critical need for JavaScript proficiency testing during technical interviews and skill assessment in web development. Each question presents code snippets with multiple-choice answers and expandable explanations that dive deep into JavaScript's execution context, memory management, and language-specific behaviors. Originally created in 2019, it focuses on JavaScript syntax and runtime behavior relevant to that timeframe. The resource is designed for developers preparing for coding interviews, senior developers refreshing their knowledge, and anyone seeking to master JavaScript's more nuanced and complex language features beyond basic programming concepts.
