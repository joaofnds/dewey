`Cheshire` is a Clojure library designed for high-performance JSON and JSON SMILE (binary JSON) encoding and decoding. It provides functionalities for converting Clojure data structures, including custom encoders, into JSON and SMILE formats, along with features for stream processing, lazy decoding, pretty-printing, and Unicode escaping.  The library supports encoding of standard Clojure data types, Java classes, and custom types, and offers performance benchmarks demonstrating its speed compared to alternatives.  This library is intended for Clojure developers needing efficient JSON serialization and deserialization capabilities within their applications.
