Cheshire is a high-performance JSON encoding/decoding library for Clojure that provides fast serialization capabilities with extended type support beyond standard JSON primitives. Built on Jackson JSON processor, it handles native Clojure data structures including Dates, UUIDs, Sets, and Symbols while supporting both standard JSON and binary SMILE format encoding. The library targets Clojure web developers and backend engineers who need efficient JSON processing for REST APIs, data interchange, and web services. It addresses performance limitations of earlier Clojure JSON libraries by combining speed with advanced features like custom encoders, pretty printing, streaming parsers, lazy sequence processing, and flexible key transformation functions. Cheshire serves as a core dependency for Clojure web applications requiring robust JSON serialization capabilities.
