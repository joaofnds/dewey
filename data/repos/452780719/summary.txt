runwasi is a Rust-based containerd shim that enables WebAssembly (WASM) and WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) workloads to run as first-class containers within containerd-managed environments, including Kubernetes clusters. The project addresses the DevOps and cloud-native domain by providing a library that integrates WASM runtime capabilities with the containerd container runtime, allowing system administrators and platform engineers to deploy lightweight WASM applications alongside traditional containers. It supports multiple WASM runtimes like Wasmtime and provides a standardized interface for running WASM workloads through the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), enabling serverless and edge computing scenarios where traditional container overhead is prohibitive while maintaining compatibility with existing Kubernetes tooling and workflows.
