`runwasi` is a Rust library and project facilitating the execution of WebAssembly (Wasm) and WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) workloads within containerd, targeting containerized application deployments. It provides a runtime shim integrating with containerd to manage and run Wasm/WASI applications, enabling developers to deploy and execute these workloads, either directly via `ctr` or through Kubernetes' CRI plugin. This project includes a proof-of-concept WASI host implementation, demonstrating a core functionality of running WASI applications, and the `containerd-shim-wasm` crate as a core component. It's geared towards system developers and cloud engineers working with container orchestration, enabling the use of Wasm for containerized applications.
