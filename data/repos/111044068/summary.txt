TSyringe is a TypeScript/JavaScript library providing a lightweight dependency injection (DI) container for constructor injection, enabling loose coupling and testability. It facilitates the registration and resolution of dependencies using decorators such as `@injectable`, `@singleton`, and `@inject`, along with various provider types including class, value, factory, and token providers. Key functionalities include support for circular dependencies via a `delay` helper, scoped dependencies, and automatic instance disposal, enabling developers to manage application component lifecycles. As a developer productivity library, its architecture leverages TypeScript decorators and utilizes a container registry to resolve instances.
