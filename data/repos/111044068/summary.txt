TSyringe is a lightweight dependency injection (DI) container library for TypeScript and JavaScript applications, primarily targeting web and Node.js developers building scalable software architectures. It implements constructor injection patterns using TypeScript decorators like `@injectable()`, `@singleton()`, and `@inject()`, enabling inversion of control (IoC) for better code modularity and testability. The library leverages TypeScript's experimental decorator metadata and Reflect API polyfills to automatically resolve class dependencies at runtime. Key features include container-based service registration, lifecycle management (singleton/transient scopes), circular dependency resolution with delay helpers, child container hierarchies, and interface-based injection tokens. TSyringe addresses the common enterprise development challenge of managing complex object dependencies and promotes loose coupling in TypeScript/JavaScript applications, making it particularly valuable for developers building large-scale web applications, APIs, and microservices where dependency management and testing are critical concerns.
