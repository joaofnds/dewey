trouble.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides a unified interface for displaying and navigating code analysis results within the editor. It serves software developers working in any programming language by consolidating LSP diagnostics, references, definitions, implementations, document symbols, quickfix/location lists, and search results from Telescope/fzf-lua into customizable, pretty-formatted windows. The plugin leverages Neovim's built-in LSP client and Tree-sitter parsers to present hierarchical tree views with advanced filtering, sorting, and navigation capabilities. It addresses the common developer workflow problem of efficiently reviewing and jumping between code issues, symbol definitions, and search results by replacing Neovim's default sparse diagnostic displays with rich, contextual views that support multiple simultaneous windows, real-time following of cursor position, and extensive keyboard-driven navigation patterns.
