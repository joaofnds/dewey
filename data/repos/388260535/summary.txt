The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide (LKMPG) is a comprehensive technical documentation project that provides updated guidance for developing Linux kernel modules compatible with modern 5.x and 6.x kernel versions. Written in LaTeX and targeting systems programmers, kernel developers, and device driver engineers, it addresses the outdated nature of existing kernel module tutorials that only cover legacy 2.6.x kernels. The repository includes working C code examples for loadable kernel modules (LKMs), device drivers, and kernel-space programming techniques. Built using TeXLive/MacTeX with Docker containerization support, it generates both PDF and HTML documentation, serving as an essential resource for low-level Linux system development and kernel programming education.
