`lkmpg` is a comprehensive, up-to-date guide for Linux kernel module programming, targeting developers seeking to create device drivers and other kernel-level functionalities. The project provides a freely available, actively maintained book and includes working examples compatible with modern 5.x and 6.x Linux kernels, contrasting with older, outdated versions of the guide. The primary technology is TeX, used to generate PDF and HTML documentation, with shell scripts and `make` utilities employed for build automation and dependency management, including TeXLive and possibly Pygments. This is a book and accompanying example project for developers and system programmers focused on extending the Linux kernel.
