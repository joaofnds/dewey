Carbon is a web-based tool for generating aesthetically enhanced images of source code snippets, primarily targeting web developers, educators, and technical content creators. Built with JavaScript and React, it addresses the common need for visually appealing code screenshots used in presentations, social media posts, documentation, and educational materials. The application provides syntax highlighting, customizable themes, font selection, background styling, and various export formats. It integrates with GitHub Gists for code import and supports sharing mechanisms optimized for platforms like Twitter and Slack with automatic image unfurling. Carbon solves the problem of creating professional-looking code visualizations without requiring design skills or image editing software, streamlining the workflow for developers who frequently share code snippets in technical communication, tutorials, and social media content.
