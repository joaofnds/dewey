`gitbase` is a standalone application providing a SQL interface for querying Git repositories, written in Go. It leverages the `src-d/go-mysql-server` SQL engine to interpret queries against Git history and code's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), accessible via the MySQL wire protocol. This tool allows users to analyze Git repositories and their source code using SQL, integrating with existing tools and frameworks, and it is designed to process numerous repositories. It's currently in an alpha stage and aims for integration with Apache Spark for large-scale analysis.
