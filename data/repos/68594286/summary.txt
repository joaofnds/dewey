gitbase is a Go-based SQL database interface that enables querying Git repositories using standard SQL syntax through the MySQL wire protocol. Built on src-d/go-mysql-server, it targets data scientists, DevOps engineers, and software analysts who need to perform large-scale source code analysis and Git history mining. The system exposes Git repository data as queryable SQL tables, allowing users to analyze commit history, code changes, and Universal AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) structures across multiple repositories simultaneously. It solves the challenge of programmatically analyzing Git repositories at scale by providing familiar SQL querying capabilities instead of requiring custom Git API scripting, making it accessible through any MySQL-compatible client or programming language library for repository analytics and code intelligence workflows.
