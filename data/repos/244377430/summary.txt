`oha` is a command-line HTTP load generator, written in Rust, inspired by `rakyll/hey`, and designed to benchmark web applications. It provides real-time TUI-based performance monitoring during load tests, leveraging the `tokio` asynchronous runtime and the `ratatui` TUI library. Key functionalities include configurable request parameters, HTTP/2 support, rate limiting (QPS), burst testing features, the ability to read URLs from a file, and support for dynamic URL generation via regular expressions. This is a standalone CLI application primarily for developers and system administrators to assess web application performance and identify bottlenecks.
