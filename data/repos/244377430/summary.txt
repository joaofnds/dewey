oha is a Rust-based HTTP load testing and benchmarking tool designed for web development and DevOps workflows. Built with tokio for asynchronous networking and ratatui for terminal user interface, it generates concurrent HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests against web applications while displaying real-time performance metrics through an animated TUI. The tool supports configurable request rates, connection pooling, duration-based testing, and various authentication methods including Bearer tokens and custom headers. Targeting developers, QA engineers, and site reliability engineers, oha addresses the need for lightweight, efficient load testing with immediate visual feedback, serving as a modern alternative to traditional CLI-only load generators like Apache Bench and hey.
