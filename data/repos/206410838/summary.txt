This repository contains Google's comprehensive engineering practices documentation, serving as a knowledge-sharing resource for software development teams across all programming languages and project types. The primary focus is on code review processes, featuring detailed guidelines split into separate guides for code reviewers and change authors (developers submitting code). The documentation addresses core software engineering challenges around maintaining code quality, establishing consistent review standards, and optimizing collaborative development workflows. Licensed under CC-By 3.0 for broad adoption, it targets software engineers, technical leads, and engineering managers seeking to implement proven code review practices and development processes. The materials are language-agnostic and applicable across web development, mobile development, systems programming, and other software engineering domains where code review and quality assurance are critical.
