The rofi-themes repository serves as the official collection of CSS-based themes for Rofi, a window switcher and application launcher for Linux desktop environments. Targeting Linux system administrators, power users, and desktop customization enthusiasts, this repository addresses the need for visual customization of Rofi's interface through CSS styling. The themes enable users to modify the appearance of Rofi's application launcher, window switcher, and run dialog components to match their desktop environment aesthetics or personal preferences. While currently archived due to maintenance constraints, it previously functioned as a community-driven theme gallery where contributors could submit CSS-based visual modifications for integration into Rofi's official distribution, supporting the broader Linux desktop customization ecosystem.
