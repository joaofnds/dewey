`neverthrow` is a TypeScript library providing type-safe error handling for JavaScript and TypeScript applications, specifically within the domain of developer productivity and functional programming. It introduces `Result` and `ResultAsync` types representing success (`Ok`) or failure (`Err`), and includes methods for mapping, chaining, and recovering from errors, including asynchronous operations. This library offers utilities like `fromThrowable` to safely wrap potentially throwing functions and static methods for combining and handling errors. It is a developer-focused library and is also supported by an eslint plugin for enhanced error handling.
