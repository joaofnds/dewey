NeverThrow is a TypeScript library that implements functional error handling through a `Result<T, E>` type system, representing either success (`Ok`) or failure (`Err`) states. Targeting JavaScript and TypeScript web developers, it eliminates traditional try-catch error handling by encoding failures directly into the type system. The library provides both synchronous `Result` and asynchronous `ResultAsync` APIs with functional programming methods like `map`, `andThen`, `match`, and `combine` for composable error handling. It includes utilities for wrapping throwable functions and promises, plus an ESLint plugin to enforce proper error handling. This approach enables developers to write more predictable, type-safe code by making error states explicit and preventing unhandled exceptions in web applications.
