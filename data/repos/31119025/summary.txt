Dexador is a high-performance HTTP client library for Common Lisp that provides a modern alternative to the existing Drakma library for web development and API integration. It implements connection pooling, automatic redirect handling, multipart form-data detection, cookie management via cl-cookie, and both basic and bearer authentication mechanisms. The library targets Common Lisp developers building web applications, REST API clients, and web scraping tools who need efficient HTTP communication with features like automatic content-type detection, file upload support, and persistent connections. Dexador addresses performance bottlenecks in HTTP requests, particularly for same-host requests, while offering a cleaner API surface and better error handling through condition signaling. It eliminates OpenSSL dependencies on Windows and provides comprehensive debugging capabilities with verbose request/response logging.
