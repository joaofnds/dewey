Checklist-Checklist is a curated repository that aggregates development and operational checklists across multiple domains within software engineering and technology operations. Built as a JavaScript-based web application, it serves as a centralized reference hub for developers, DevOps engineers, and IT professionals seeking standardized workflows and best practices. The repository covers comprehensive checklists for front-end and back-end web development, platform setup (Linux, OSX, Ubuntu), programming language-specific guidelines (Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Go, Java), security auditing, deployment procedures, and project management workflows. It addresses the common problem of maintaining consistent quality and security standards across diverse technology stacks by providing community-vetted checklists for critical development lifecycle phases including code review, deployment, testing, and security validation.
