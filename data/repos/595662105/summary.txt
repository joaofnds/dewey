GitButler is a Git client application built with Rust/Tauri backend and Svelte frontend that reimagines branch management for software developers. It enables simultaneous work on multiple branches within a single working directory through "virtual branches" - a layer above Git that tracks uncommitted changes and allows dynamic organization of file modifications into separate branches without traditional context switching. The application addresses the limitations of `git add -p` and `git rebase -i` by providing real-time branch management, allowing developers to move changes between branches during development and push them individually to remotes. Targeting software developers in version control workflows, it distributes as a cross-platform desktop application for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
