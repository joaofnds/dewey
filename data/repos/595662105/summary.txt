GitButler is a standalone, cross-platform Git client application designed to enhance developer workflow through advanced branch management. It enables parallel work on multiple branches within the same working directory via a concept of "virtual branches," allowing for efficient organization of file changes. Built with Tauri, Rust, and Svelte, the application provides features such as easy commit management, an undo timeline, GitHub integration for pull requests, and AI-driven commit message generation. It targets developers seeking a more flexible and productive alternative to standard Git command-line interactions, particularly those managing complex branch structures.
