`tsdef` is a TypeScript utility library that provides a comprehensive collection of type definition shortcuts for common programming patterns, specifically targeting TypeScript developers working on type-safe applications. The library addresses the repetitive nature of defining complex utility types by offering pre-built type aliases for nullability handling (`Nullable<T>`, `NonNull<T>`), property transformations (`RequiredProps<T>`, `WritableProps<T>`), deep object manipulations (`DeepPartial<T>`), and generic type operations (`ValueOf<T>`, `KeyOfType<T, U>`). It serves web developers, frontend engineers, and full-stack TypeScript developers who need to eliminate boilerplate code when working with advanced TypeScript type manipulations, conditional types, and mapped types. The library functions as a development dependency that enhances developer productivity by providing battle-tested type utilities for complex type transformations commonly needed in modern TypeScript codebases.
