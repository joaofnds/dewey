`tsdef` is a TypeScript library providing shortcut definitions and utility types for common patterns. It offers a collection of type definitions, including `Nullable`, `NonNull`, `MaybePromise`, `AnyClass`, `AnyObject`, and utilities for manipulating and extracting information about types such as `ValueOf`, `ExcludeKeys`, and `DeepPartial`. The library facilitates improved type safety and code conciseness in TypeScript projects by providing reusable type definitions and related functionality. This is a developer productivity tool designed for use within TypeScript projects, enhancing code maintainability and readability.
