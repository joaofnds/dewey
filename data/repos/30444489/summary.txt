This repository is a comprehensive knowledge base containing over 1,600 concise technical write-ups covering day-to-day discoveries across software development technologies. It serves as a reference collection for web developers, DevOps engineers, and software engineers working with diverse tech stacks including JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, Ruby/Rails, Python, Elixir/Phoenix, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, Git, Vim/Neovim, and shell scripting. The entries document specific solutions, configurations, and techniques for common development challenges across frontend frameworks (React, Next.js, Astro), backend technologies, databases, deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Heroku), and developer tooling. Written in a "Today I Learned" format, it addresses the need for quick technical references and knowledge sharing among practitioners working in modern web development and cloud infrastructure environments.
