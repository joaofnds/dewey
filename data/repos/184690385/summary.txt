Numcl is a pure Common Lisp implementation that replicates NumPy's array processing functionality for scientific computing and numerical analysis. The library provides a comprehensive API mirroring NumPy's interface while maintaining compatibility with Common Lisp's native array system, requiring specialized arrays displaced to simple 1D arrays for optimal performance. It implements mathematical operations, array manipulation functions, and type-correct computations that return arrays with the most specific element types. Targeting data scientists, researchers, and Lisp developers working on numerical computing applications, Numcl serves as a bridge between Python's NumPy ecosystem and Common Lisp's symbolic processing capabilities. The library emphasizes correctness over speed, uses function-based APIs rather than macros, and maintains zero-overhead design through compiler-side optimization, enabling scientific computing workflows entirely within the Common Lisp environment.
