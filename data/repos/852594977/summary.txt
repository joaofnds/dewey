pg_mooncake is a PostgreSQL extension that transforms the database into a high-performance analytical data warehouse by adding columnar storage and vectorized query execution through DuckDB integration. Built for the data engineering and analytics domain, it stores columnstore tables as Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake tables in local filesystems or cloud storage (S3/R2), enabling lakehouse architecture patterns. The extension leverages C++ for performance-critical operations while maintaining full PostgreSQL compatibility for transactional operations (CRUD), joins with heap tables, and data loading from Parquet/CSV/JSON files. It targets data engineers, analysts, and database administrators who need OLAP capabilities within existing PostgreSQL infrastructure, solving the performance gap between traditional row-based PostgreSQL and specialized analytical databases without requiring separate systems or complex ETL pipelines.
