Noti is a Go-based command-line utility designed for DevOps and system administration workflows that monitors process execution and delivers cross-platform notifications upon completion. The tool addresses the productivity challenge of long-running commands, builds, and deployments by providing automated alerts through 16+ notification services including Slack, Telegram, Pushover, and native desktop notifications across macOS, Linux, and Windows. It supports three monitoring modes: command wrapping, post-execution chaining, and PID watching for already-running processes. Target users include developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who frequently execute time-intensive operations like compilation, data processing, backup tasks, or CI/CD pipeline steps and need asynchronous notification when processes complete, eliminating the need for manual monitoring.
