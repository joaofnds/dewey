This repository contains a custom regular expression engine implemented in Ruby, designed as an educational and experimental alternative to Ruby's built-in regex functionality. The engine features multiple compilation backends including Cranelift (Rust-based JIT compiler), integrates with Capstone for machine code disassembly, and uses Graphviz for visualizing syntax trees and state machines. It supports core regex features like repetition, capturing groups, alternation, and grouping, while providing APIs for pattern matching and compilation analysis. The project targets Ruby developers and compiler enthusiasts interested in understanding regex engine internals, language implementation, and just-in-time compilation techniques. The repository has been deprecated in favor of a successor project (exreg), indicating its primary value as a learning resource for regex engine architecture and Ruby native extension development.
