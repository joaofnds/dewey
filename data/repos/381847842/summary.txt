This Ruby library provides a regular expression engine, enabling pattern matching within Ruby applications. It allows users to define and utilize regular expressions for string matching, with features including repetition, grouping, alternation, and character properties. The project leverages Ruby's core language features and has dependencies on Rust (via Cranelift), Capstone, and Graphviz for compilation and debugging capabilities, targeting developers who need to integrate robust regular expression functionality into their Ruby projects. The library is distributed as a Ruby gem.
