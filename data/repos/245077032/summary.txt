disease.sh is a Node.js-based REST API that aggregates and serves real-time epidemiological data for COVID-19 and Influenza outbreaks. Built with JavaScript and Redis for caching, it targets web developers and data scientists who need programmatic access to disease statistics including global case counts, regional mobility data, and government health datasets. The API scrapes data from sources like Worldometers, Johns Hopkins CSSE, and CDC, providing endpoints for current cases, historical trends, and geographic breakdowns. It serves the public health informatics domain by solving the challenge of accessing standardized, up-to-date disease surveillance data across multiple data sources through a unified interface, enabling developers to build dashboards, mobile apps, and analytical tools without managing complex data collection pipelines.
