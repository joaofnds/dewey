RE2 is a C++ regular expression library designed as a high-performance, memory-safe alternative to traditional backtracking regex engines found in PCRE, Perl, and Python. Built with Abseil dependencies and tested using GoogleTest and Benchmark frameworks, RE2 provides deterministic linear-time pattern matching that prevents catastrophic backtracking and ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks. The library targets software developers across domains requiring robust text processing, including web development, systems programming, security applications, and data parsing workflows. RE2 offers native C++ APIs with extensive language bindings for Python, Node.js, Ruby, Perl, OCaml, and other platforms, making it suitable for performance-critical applications where regex safety and predictable execution time are essential requirements.
