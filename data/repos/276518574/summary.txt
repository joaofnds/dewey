This repository provides custom LED matrix firmware written in C for the Anne Pro 2 mechanical keyboard, specifically designed to work with the open-source QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware port. The firmware targets embedded systems development in the mechanical keyboard enthusiast domain, supporting both C15 and C18 hardware revisions of the Anne Pro 2's LED controller chip. It enables custom lighting effects and LED matrix control that integrates with QMK's keyboard functionality, replacing the stock Obins firmware. The project uses ARM-based microcontroller programming with SWD debugging support via JLink or Black Magic Probe debuggers. Primary users are keyboard enthusiasts, firmware developers, and makers who want programmable LED control integrated with custom keyboard layouts and macros in the mechanical keyboard hobbyist community.
