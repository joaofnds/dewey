Bytebase is a database DevSecOps platform built in Go that provides centralized database lifecycle management across multiple database systems including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server, and Snowflake. It implements GitOps workflows for database schema migrations, SQL review with 100+ lint rules, role-based access control (RBAC), and data masking capabilities. The platform serves as a unified tool for database change management, query execution, and security governance, targeting developers, DBAs, security teams, and platform engineers who need to standardize database operations across heterogeneous environments. It integrates with GitHub/GitLab for version-controlled database changes and provides comprehensive audit logging, drift detection, and policy enforcement to replace fragmented database tooling with a single DevSecOps solution for database administration and development workflows.
