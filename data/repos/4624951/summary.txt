The `cldwalker/table` repository provides a Clojure library for generating and displaying ASCII tables from various data structures within a terminal environment. This library handles nested maps, vectors, lists, and sets, offering customizable table styles including Unicode, org-mode, and GitHub-markdown formats. It automatically adjusts table widths to fit the terminal and allows for custom style definitions. This developer productivity tool primarily targets Clojure developers needing to visualize and format data for debugging, reporting, or other terminal-based output.
