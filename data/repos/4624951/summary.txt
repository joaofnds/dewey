This Clojure library provides ASCII table rendering functionality for terminal-based data visualization and debugging workflows. It automatically formats diverse data structures (maps, vectors, lists, sets, and their nested combinations) into properly aligned ASCII tables that fit terminal dimensions. The library targets Clojure developers working in REPL-driven development, data exploration, and command-line tooling scenarios. It supports multiple output formats including Unicode, Org-mode, GitHub Markdown, and custom styling configurations, while handling automatic column sizing and terminal width detection. The tool addresses the common need for readable tabular output during interactive development sessions and replaces basic print functions with professionally formatted table displays for improved data inspection and debugging workflows.
