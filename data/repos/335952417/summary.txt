Cosign is a container security tool written in Go that provides cryptographic signing and verification capabilities for OCI containers and other software artifacts within the DevOps and container ecosystem. Built as part of the Sigstore project, it implements "keyless signing" through integration with Fulcio certificate authority and Rekor transparency log, eliminating the need for traditional key management while ensuring supply chain security. The tool supports multiple signing methods including hardware/KMS signing, encrypted keypairs, and bring-your-own PKI, with signatures stored directly in OCI registries alongside container images. Cosign addresses the critical problem of software supply chain integrity by enabling developers, DevOps engineers, and security teams to cryptographically verify the authenticity and provenance of container images before deployment, making digital signatures transparent infrastructure in cloud-native environments.
