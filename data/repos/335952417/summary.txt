Cosign is a Go-based command-line tool for signing and verifying container images and other OCI artifacts, operating within the domain of software supply chain security. Its core functionality includes keyless signing using Sigstore's Fulcio certificate authority and Rekor transparency log, along with support for hardware/KMS signing and private keypair generation. Cosign integrates with OCI registries for signature storage and offers features for verifying container images and various artifacts such as blobs, Tekton bundles, WASM modules, eBPF images, and in-toto attestations. As a standalone CLI application, it aims to make container and artifact signing and verification an integral part of the software development lifecycle for developers and operations teams.
