`fcp` is a command-line tool providing a significantly faster alternative to the Unix `cp` command, designed for efficient file and directory copying. Implemented in Rust, it leverages parallelism and, on macOS, copy-on-write mechanisms to achieve substantial performance gains, especially on SSD-equipped systems. Key functionalities include high-speed copying of files and directories, optimized for common `cp` use cases, and offers pre-built binaries and installation support through package managers like `cargo`, Homebrew, and AUR. This standalone, command-line application targets system administrators and developers seeking improved file copy performance on Unix-like systems.
