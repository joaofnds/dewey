`fcp` is a high-performance Unix file copying utility written in Rust that serves as a drop-in replacement for the traditional `cp(1)` command, targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers working with large file operations on Unix-like systems. The tool leverages multi-threading to parallelize directory traversal and file copying operations across multiple CPU cores, significantly improving throughput on SSD-based systems. On macOS, it utilizes copy-on-write functionality through `fclonefileat` and `fcopyfile` system calls for optimized large file handling. The CLI tool addresses performance bottlenecks in traditional single-threaded file copying workflows, particularly beneficial for build systems, deployment pipelines, and backup operations where copying large directories or files is a common bottleneck in development and infrastructure management workflows.
