Code Maat is a command-line tool written in Clojure that performs behavioral code analysis by mining and analyzing version control system data from Git, Mercurial, SVN, Perforce, and TFS repositories. It targets software development teams and technical leads working on large-scale codebases who need to identify technical debt, development bottlenecks, and design issues through temporal analysis of code evolution patterns. The tool generates insights on code coupling, change frequency, developer ownership, communication patterns, and refactoring opportunities by processing VCS logs and applying statistical analysis algorithms. It serves the software engineering domain by providing data-driven approaches to code quality assessment, helping teams make informed decisions about system architecture, team organization, and maintenance priorities based on actual development patterns rather than static code snapshots.
