Code Maat is a command-line tool, written in Clojure, designed for mining and analyzing data from version control systems (VCS) to identify design issues and development bottlenecks. Its core functionality involves parsing VCS log files from Git, Mercurial, SVN, Perforce, and TFS to generate various code metrics and perform behavioral code analysis, including coupling analysis, code age assessment, and churn measurement. Code Maat provides several analyses such as summary statistics, author contributions, and logical coupling identification, with outputs typically formatted as CSV files. This standalone application targets developers and software architects seeking to understand code evolution, identify potential refactoring targets, and monitor technical debt.
