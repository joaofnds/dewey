MikroORM is a TypeScript Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js web development that implements Data Mapper, Unit of Work, and Identity Map design patterns. It provides database abstraction for MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, libSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server, enabling developers to work with entities and relationships instead of raw SQL queries. The library features automatic transaction management, changeset-based persistence, query building, schema generation, and relationship modeling with cascading operations. Inspired by Doctrine and Hibernate, it targets backend developers building Node.js applications who need robust database interaction capabilities with TypeScript support, offering implicit transaction handling and entity lifecycle management for complex data operations.
