**evil-helix** is a soft fork of the Helix text editor written in Rust that introduces Vim-style keybindings and modal editing capabilities to the modern terminal-based editor. Targeting developers and system administrators familiar with Vim/Neovim workflows, it implements classic Vim commands (a, c, d, y, x), motions (w, e, b, 0, $), and visual modes while maintaining Helix's native language server protocol integration and tree-sitter syntax highlighting. The project addresses the gap between Helix's innovative editing model and traditional Vim muscle memory by providing configurable evil-mode functionality, Vim modeline support, and enhanced visual features like colored indentation guides. It serves the software development and system administration domains by offering a performance-focused alternative to plugin-based Vim emulation, with TOML-based configuration and regular upstream compatibility through automated rebasing onto Helix's master branch.
