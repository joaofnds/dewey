Concourse is a container-based continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) automation system written in Go, designed for DevOps teams and platform engineers. It provides declarative pipeline orchestration using containers (containerd/runc) for build isolation and reproducible execution environments. The system emphasizes immutability, idempotency, and stateless workers to ensure reliable automation workflows. Concourse targets complex CI/CD scenarios including multi-branch workflows, pull request automation, and scalable build pipelines through features like instanced pipelines, dynamic parallelization with `across` steps, and prototype-based extensibility. The web interface is built with Elm, and the platform supports credential management through variable sources and external integrations. It serves organizations requiring robust, scalable automation beyond simple build-test-deploy workflows, particularly those managing multiple projects, complex deployment strategies, or infrastructure-as-code practices.
