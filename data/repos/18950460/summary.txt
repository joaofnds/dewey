Concourse is a container-based automation system written in Go, designed for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. It enables users to define and manage complex automation workflows using declarative YAML configuration, automating tasks such as build, test, and deployment. Key features include idempotency, immutability, and support for reproducible builds, with pipelines built to scale from simple to complex automation scenarios. The project is a standalone application, primarily a developer productivity tool, targeting software engineers focused on automating their build and deployment processes.
