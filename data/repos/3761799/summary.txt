Bond is a Clojure testing library that provides spying and stubbing capabilities for unit tests through function interception and call tracking. Built specifically for Clojure's testing ecosystem, it offers macros like `with-spy`, `with-stub!`, and `with-stub-ns` that temporarily redefine functions to monitor their invocations, arguments, and return values without modifying the original implementation. The library addresses the common testing need for mocking dependencies and verifying function interactions in Clojure applications, providing argument validation and call count tracking that integrates seamlessly with existing test frameworks. Bond targets Clojure developers writing unit tests who need to isolate code under test from external dependencies, offering a more robust alternative to Clojure's built-in `with-redefs` by maintaining proper arity checking and comprehensive call introspection capabilities.
