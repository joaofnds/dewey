Bond is a Clojure library designed for spying and stubbing functions, primarily intended for use in testing. It provides macros like `with-spy` and `with-stub!` to track function calls, their arguments, and return values or facilitate function replacement with mocked implementations within a defined scope. Additionally, `with-spy-ns` and `with-stub-ns` allow for stubbing or spying on entire namespaces. This library streamlines the process of creating test doubles and verifying function behavior, making it a developer productivity tool, specifically a testing library for Clojure projects.
