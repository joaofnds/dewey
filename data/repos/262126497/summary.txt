Syft is a Go-based CLI tool and library that generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) from container images, filesystems, and archives for software supply chain security and vulnerability management. Targeting DevOps engineers, security teams, and developers in containerized environments, it analyzes Docker, OCI, and Singularity images to catalog packages across 25+ ecosystems including npm, Maven, pip, Go modules, and system packages (APK, RPM, DEB). The tool outputs standardized SBOM formats (SPDX, CycloneDX, GitHub JSON) and integrates with static analysis workflows, particularly vulnerability scanners like Grype. Syft addresses compliance requirements and security visibility challenges by providing comprehensive dependency tracking, supporting signed attestations via in-toto specifications, and enabling automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines for container-based applications.
