Syft is a Go-based CLI tool and library designed to generate Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) from container images and filesystems, facilitating vulnerability management and software supply chain security. It supports multiple SBOM formats, including CycloneDX and SPDX, and integrates with vulnerability scanners like Grype. Key features include identification of packages and libraries across various image formats (OCI, Docker) and Linux distributions, along with the ability to generate signed SBOM attestations based on the in-toto specification. It's a standalone application, targeting developers and system administrators focused on container security and compliance.
