connect-go is a Go library for building HTTP APIs that are compatible with both browser clients and gRPC systems. It implements the Connect protocol, which bridges gRPC, gRPC-Web, and Connect's own HTTP/1.1-compatible protocol for RPC communication. The library generates type-safe servers and clients from Protocol Buffer schemas, handling marshaling, routing, compression, and content negotiation automatically. Built on Go's standard net/http package, it enables developers to create microservices and web APIs that support streaming, headers, trailers, and error details across multiple protocols. The primary use case is for backend developers building distributed systems who need gRPC compatibility while maintaining browser accessibility and HTTP/1.1 support for easier debugging and integration.
