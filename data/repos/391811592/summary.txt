`connectrpc/connect-go` is a Go library designed for building browser and gRPC-compatible HTTP APIs. It facilitates Protobuf-based RPC communication, generating code for handling marshaling, routing, compression, and content type negotiation, including type-safe clients. The library supports gRPC, gRPC-Web, and its own Connect protocol, providing features such as streaming, headers, and trailers over HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. Primarily a developer productivity tool, it leverages `net/http` compatibility and targets Go developers building network services, with the library itself acting as an API and SDK for RPC implementation.
