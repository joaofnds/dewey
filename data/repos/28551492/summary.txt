Elixir-Slack is a comprehensive Slack API client library written in Elixir that provides both Real Time Messaging (RTM) and Web API integration capabilities for building Slack bots and applications. The library targets Elixir developers working in chat automation and messaging integration domains, offering WebSocket-based RTM connectivity for real-time event handling and complete Slack Web API coverage through auto-generated modules. It implements the Actor model pattern using Elixir's GenServer behavior for managing persistent connections and handling concurrent message processing. The library solves the problem of integrating Elixir applications with Slack workspaces, enabling developers to create sophisticated chatbots, automated messaging systems, and Slack-integrated workflows using Elixir's fault-tolerant, concurrent programming model.
