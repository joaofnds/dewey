`Elixir-Slack` is an Elixir library providing a real-time messaging and web API client for interacting with the Slack platform. It enables developers to build Slack bots and applications, supporting both the Real Time Messaging (RTM) API for event-driven interactions and the Web API for programmatic access to Slack's features.  The library includes modules for handling Slack events, sending messages, and interacting with various Slack resources such as users, channels, and groups, leveraging Elixir's concurrency features. It is designed as a library intended for Elixir developers who need to integrate Slack functionality into their applications, and exposes Web API access via generated modules.
