`gitsh` is an interactive shell application designed to enhance developer productivity within the Git version control system. Written in Ruby, it provides a dedicated environment for executing Git commands, reducing repetitive typing and offering features such as command completion, alias support, and session-specific Git configuration overrides. Users can run Git commands, shell commands, and leverage features like history and magic variables for repository state access. `gitsh` functions as a standalone command-line interface (CLI) tool targeted at developers who frequently interact with Git repositories.
