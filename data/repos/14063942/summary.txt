gitsh is a Ruby-based interactive shell specifically designed for Git version control operations, targeting developers and DevOps engineers who frequently execute multiple Git commands in sequence. The tool eliminates repetitive "git" prefixes by providing a dedicated Git command environment with features like tab completion for Git commands/branches/aliases, customizable prompts displaying repository state, temporary Git configuration variables, magic variables for accessing repository information, and support for command chaining with logical operators. It integrates with Git workflow tools like hub and gh, includes shell command execution capabilities, and maintains compatibility with existing Git aliases and configurations. The project addresses the inefficiency of repeatedly typing "git" commands in standard shells, streamlining Git-heavy development workflows through a purpose-built REPL interface for version control operations.
