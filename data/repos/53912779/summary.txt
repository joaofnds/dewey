Neoformat is a Vim/Neovim plugin written in Vim Script that provides automated code formatting capabilities across multiple programming languages and file types. The plugin integrates with external formatting tools (like prettier, black, clang-format, autopep8) and formats code either on-demand via the `:Neoformat` command or automatically on file save through autocmd hooks. It operates by reading buffer content using `getbufline()`, passing data to formatters via stdin or temporary files, and updating the buffer with `setline()` while preserving marks and jumps. The plugin supports extensive configuration for custom formatters, fallback chains, and language-specific options. Targeting software developers across web development, systems programming, and general software engineering domains, Neoformat addresses the universal need for consistent code formatting and style enforcement within the Vim ecosystem, supporting dozens of languages from JavaScript and Python to C++, Go, and Rust.
