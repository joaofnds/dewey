Solargraph is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for Ruby that provides IDE-like features including IntelliSense autocompletion, diagnostics, inline documentation, and static type checking. Built in Ruby, it integrates with popular editors like VS Code, Vim, Emacs, and Sublime Text through LSP clients. The server analyzes Ruby codebases, generates code maps from installed gems using YARD documentation, and supports Bundler integration for dependency management. It includes a type checker that combines YARD tags with code analysis for type inference and validation. Targeted at Ruby developers working on web applications, Rails projects, and general Ruby development, Solargraph enhances developer productivity by providing comprehensive language support traditionally available only in compiled language IDEs.
