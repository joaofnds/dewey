RetroArch is a cross-platform C-based frontend for the libretro API that serves as a unified interface for running video game emulators and game engines across multiple platforms. Targeting the retro gaming and emulation community, it provides a sophisticated abstraction layer that allows libretro cores (emulators packaged as dynamic libraries) to run consistently across 50+ platforms including consoles, mobile devices, and desktop systems. The application implements advanced graphics pipelines supporting OpenGL, Vulkan, and Direct3D with multi-pass shader support, real-time rewind functionality, and CRT display compatibility. It addresses the fragmentation problem in emulation by providing developers and retro gaming enthusiasts with a single, feature-rich frontend that eliminates the need for platform-specific emulator interfaces while offering advanced features like run-ahead input latency reduction and video recording capabilities.
