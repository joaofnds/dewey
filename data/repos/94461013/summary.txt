Faktory is a language-agnostic, persistent background job server designed for distributing and managing asynchronous tasks within applications. Implemented in Go, it enables queuing and processing of jobs with JSON payloads, allowing workers written in any language to fetch and execute them. Key features include job queuing, reservations with timeouts, automatic retry workflows with exponential backoff for failed jobs, and a comprehensive web UI for monitoring and management. This standalone application provides a central repository for background jobs, supporting scalability across multiple machines and targeting developers seeking to offload asynchronous operations.
