Faktory is a language-agnostic background job server implemented in Go that provides persistent job queue management for distributed applications. It serves as a centralized work server where jobs are represented as JSON payloads, organized into queues, and distributed across multiple worker processes or machines. The system implements job reservation with configurable timeouts, automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed jobs, and comprehensive job lifecycle management including ACK/FAIL acknowledgments. Targeted at backend developers and DevOps engineers building scalable web applications, Faktory addresses the common problem of asynchronous task processing and job distribution in microservices architectures. It includes a web-based management UI for monitoring and administration, supporting deployment via Docker and cloud platforms like AWS ECS, making it suitable for modern containerized environments.
