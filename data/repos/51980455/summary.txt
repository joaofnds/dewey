Alacritty is a cross-platform terminal emulator built in Rust that leverages OpenGL for GPU-accelerated text rendering to achieve high performance terminal operations. Targeting developers, system administrators, and power users across BSD, Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, it implements VTE (Virtual Terminal Emulator) protocols while prioritizing speed and configurability over feature bloat. The application addresses performance bottlenecks in traditional CPU-based terminal emulators by offloading rendering to the GPU, requiring OpenGL ES 2.0 support. Rather than reimplementing terminal multiplexing or tabbing features, Alacritty focuses on core terminal emulation excellence and integrates with external tools like tmux, making it particularly suitable for development workflows and command-line intensive tasks where terminal responsiveness is critical.
