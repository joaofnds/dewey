The `quote` repository is a Rust library designed for quasi-quoting, facilitating the generation of Rust source code tokens from data structures. It provides the `quote!` macro, allowing developers to write code-like syntax that's treated as data, enabling the manipulation and generation of `proc_macro2::TokenStream` objects. This functionality is particularly relevant for creating procedural macros, and it integrates with the `syn` crate for parsing Rust syntax.  It supports features such as interpolation using `#var`, repetition, and hygiene preservation, with integration with `prettyplease` for code formatting during generation for use in build scripts and non-macro code generators.  The library is intended for use by Rust developers, particularly those working with procedural macros or requiring programmatic code generation.
