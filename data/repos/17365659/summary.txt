Eyebrowse is an Emacs Lisp package that provides window configuration management for the Emacs text editor. It addresses the common workflow challenge faced by Emacs users who need to manage multiple window layouts and switch between different workspace configurations efficiently. The package enables developers, system administrators, and other technical professionals who use Emacs as their primary development environment to organize and persist window arrangements across editing sessions. Built specifically for the Emacs ecosystem using Emacs Lisp, it integrates with Emacs' native window management system to provide workspace-like functionality similar to virtual desktops in window managers. The tool primarily serves software developers, configuration management professionals, and technical writers who rely on Emacs for coding, documentation, and system administration tasks, allowing them to maintain separate window layouts for different projects or contexts within a single Emacs instance.
