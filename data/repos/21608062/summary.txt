`Work-Sans` is an HTML repository containing the Work Sans font family, a grotesque sans-serif typeface designed for on-screen use, optimized for medium-sized text. The project provides font files in TTF, WOFF, and WOFF2 formats for web use, along with variable TTF font files. It incorporates an expanded character set supporting Vietnamese and other languages, and includes build scripts using `make` and the `yq` utility. This is a font project primarily targeting frontend developers and designers for use in web design and development.
