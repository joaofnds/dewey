Async::IO is a deprecated Ruby library that provided asynchronous wrappers for native Ruby IO operations, sockets, and networking primitives built on the async reactor framework. Targeting Ruby web developers and network programmers, it enabled non-blocking concurrent I/O operations through event-driven programming patterns, allowing multiple socket connections and file operations to be handled efficiently without traditional threading overhead. The library featured TCP/UDP endpoint abstractions, stream buffering with deferred packet optimization, configurable operation timeouts, and integration with Ruby's native IO classes. It solved the problem of blocking I/O operations in Ruby applications by providing async/await-style concurrency for network servers, clients, and file operations, though users are now directed to use io-endpoint and io-stream libraries instead.
