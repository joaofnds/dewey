`socketry/async-io` is a Ruby library providing concurrent wrappers for Ruby's native IO and socket operations. It facilitates asynchronous I/O operations, enabling non-blocking socket and IO interactions within Ruby applications. This library is designed for building more responsive and efficient network and IO-bound Ruby programs, targeting developers needing to handle concurrent IO tasks. Its core functionality revolves around improving the performance of applications dealing with network sockets and IO streams through asynchronous operation.
