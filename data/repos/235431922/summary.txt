Rod is a Go-based Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) driver designed for web automation, scraping, and testing workflows. Built directly on Chrome's DevTools Protocol, it enables developers to programmatically control headless or full Chrome browsers for tasks like web scraping, end-to-end testing, and automated browser interactions. The library provides both high-level abstractions for common automation patterns and low-level CDP access for custom implementations. Key features include automatic element waiting, request hijacking, iframe/shadow DOM handling, and built-in browser lifecycle management. Rod targets Go developers in web development, QA testing, and data extraction domains who need reliable browser automation capabilities with thread-safe operations, comprehensive debugging tools, and robust error handling for production web scraping and testing scenarios.
