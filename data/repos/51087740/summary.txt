ADR Tools is a command-line utility written in Shell scripts for managing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) within software development projects. It targets software architects, technical leads, and development teams who need to document and track architectural decisions in a structured format. The tool creates and manages numbered Markdown files in a project directory structure, enabling teams to initialize ADR repositories, create new decision records, establish relationships between decisions (such as superseding previous ADRs), and maintain a chronological log of architectural choices. It integrates with standard text editors through environment variables and follows Michael Nygard's ADR methodology for documenting technical decision-making processes in software architecture, making it particularly valuable for DevOps practices and collaborative software development workflows.
