This repository contains demonstration code for Google Next 19 conference session HYB201, specifically showcasing Istio service mesh traffic management capabilities. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform architects working with Kubernetes environments, the demos illustrate practical implementations of Istio's traffic routing, load balancing, and service mesh governance features. The repository serves as hands-on examples for cloud-native microservices deployment patterns, demonstrating how to implement canary deployments, traffic splitting, and advanced networking policies within containerized applications. These demos are designed for practitioners learning to operate production-grade service mesh architectures on Google Kubernetes Engine or similar Kubernetes platforms, providing concrete examples of Istio configuration patterns for managing inter-service communication in distributed systems.
