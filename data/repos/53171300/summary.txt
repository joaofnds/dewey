Tile38 is an open-source, in-memory geospatial database and real-time geofencing server written in Go, designed for location-based applications and spatial data processing. It provides a spatial index with geometric search operations (nearby, within, intersects) and supports multiple geospatial data formats including lat/lon points, bounding boxes, GeoHashes, GeoJSON, QuadKeys, and XYZ tiles. The system implements Redis-compatible RESP protocol alongside HTTP, WebSocket, and Telnet interfaces, enabling real-time geofencing through webhooks and pub/sub channels. Targeted at backend developers and geospatial engineers building location-aware applications, fleet tracking systems, and IoT platforms, Tile38 offers leader-follower replication, disk persistence, and Prometheus metrics integration, serving as a specialized database solution for applications requiring high-performance spatial queries and real-time location-based notifications.
