Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool written in Go that enables declarative provisioning and management of cloud and on-premises infrastructure resources. It operates in the DevOps/cloud infrastructure domain, allowing platform engineers and system administrators to define infrastructure configurations using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), generate execution plans showing proposed changes, and apply modifications through a dependency-aware resource graph engine. The core system uses a plugin-based architecture where infrastructure providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) are implemented as separate plugins distributed via the Terraform Registry. Terraform addresses the challenge of managing complex, multi-cloud infrastructure deployments by codifying API interactions into version-controlled configuration files, enabling automated provisioning, change management, and infrastructure lifecycle operations while providing predictable execution through planning and state management mechanisms.
