This repository serves as a supporting package collection for "A Tour of Go," an interactive educational platform designed to teach Go programming language fundamentals. The repo primarily contains utility packages like `golang.org/x/tour/pic` that provide helper functions and examples for Go tutorial exercises and demonstrations. While the main web interface has migrated to `golang.org/x/website`, this repository maintains the core Go packages that enable hands-on programming exercises within the tutorial environment. It targets software developers, particularly those new to Go, seeking to learn language syntax, concurrency patterns, and standard library usage through interactive coding examples. The packages facilitate educational content delivery by providing pre-built functions and scaffolding for learners to experiment with Go code concepts in a structured learning environment.
