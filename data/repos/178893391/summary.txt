LeftWM is a tiling window manager written in Rust that targets Linux desktop environments and the X11 window system. Designed for system administrators, power users, and Linux enthusiasts who prefer keyboard-driven workflow optimization, it implements automatic window tiling and multi-monitor support for efficient screen real estate management. The project follows Unix philosophy by focusing solely on window management while integrating with external compositors, status bars, and desktop components through a theme-based architecture. LeftWM uses RON (Rusty Object Notation) for configuration, supports multiple workspaces and tags, and provides extensive customization through its theming system, making it suitable for users who want granular control over their desktop environment without the complexity of full desktop environments.
