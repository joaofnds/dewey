vim-tmux-runner (VTR) is a Vim plugin written in pure Vimscript that provides seamless command execution integration between Vim editor and tmux terminal multiplexer sessions. Targeting software developers and system administrators who use terminal-based development workflows, it enables users to send commands from Vim to dedicated tmux panes for execution without leaving the editor. The plugin manages tmux runner panes through commands like `VtrSendCommandToRunner`, handling pane creation, resizing, and reorientation while supporting configurable whitespace handling for Python and other indentation-sensitive languages. It serves as a dependency-free alternative to ruby-based solutions like Vimux, addressing the common DevOps and development workflow need for rapid command execution and testing during coding sessions in Unix-like environments.
