`vim-tmux-runner` is a Vim plugin designed to facilitate interaction between Vim and the terminal multiplexer Tmux. It enables users to send commands from Vim to a Tmux pane, enabling execution and interaction. Key functionalities include commands for sending commands, pane management (resizing, reorienting, detaching), and configurable settings for whitespace handling. The project is a Vim plugin implemented entirely in Vim Script and aims to provide functionality similar to the Vimux plugin without requiring Ruby support. The target audience is Vim users who also utilize Tmux for terminal management, streamlining workflow and enhancing developer productivity within the terminal environment.
