The `semver/semver` repository defines the Semantic Versioning Specification, a standard for assigning and incrementing software version numbers. This project serves as the official specification document, available via `semver.md` and the website `semver.org`. A GitHub Actions workflow automatically publishes updates to the website daily. This is a specification document project intended for developers and maintainers of software projects who need to adhere to versioning best practices.
