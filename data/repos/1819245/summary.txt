The semver/semver repository houses the official Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer), a standardized versioning scheme used across software development ecosystems. This specification defines structured rules for assigning and incrementing version numbers in the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, enabling predictable dependency management and API compatibility tracking. Targeted at software developers, package maintainers, and DevOps engineers working with libraries, frameworks, and applications, SemVer addresses the critical problem of version conflicts and dependency hell in software distribution. The repository maintains the canonical specification document published to semver.org via automated GitHub Actions workflows, serving as the authoritative reference for package managers like npm, Cargo, and Composer across programming languages and deployment pipelines.
