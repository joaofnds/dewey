`Apheleia` is an Emacs package designed to automatically format code in various programming languages without causing cursor movement or disrupting the user's workflow. It achieves this by running code formatters asynchronously after save, applying changes using RCS patches to preserve cursor position, and employing a dynamic programming algorithm to handle point alignment within formatted regions. Built in Emacs Lisp, it integrates with existing formatters like Black and Prettier, and supports customization via hooks and alists to specify formatters and associated modes/files. Primarily intended for Emacs users seeking to automate and improve code formatting.
