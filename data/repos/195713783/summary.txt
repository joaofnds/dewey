Apheleia is an Emacs Lisp package that provides asynchronous code formatting for software developers across multiple programming languages. It integrates with external formatters like Black (Python), Prettier (JavaScript/TypeScript), and Gofmt (Go) to automatically format code on save without disrupting cursor position or editor responsiveness. The package uses RCS patches and dynamic programming algorithms (Needleman-Wunsch string alignment) to intelligently apply formatting changes while preserving the developer's cursor location and scroll position. It runs formatters on `after-save-hook` asynchronously and includes sophisticated buffer management to handle concurrent edits. Apheleia targets software developers using Emacs across web development, backend development, and general programming workflows, replacing language-specific formatting packages with a unified solution that supports formatter chaining and buffer-local configuration.
