Corfu is an Emacs Lisp package that provides an enhanced in-buffer completion interface for GNU Emacs text editor users. It implements a minimalistic popup-based completion UI that hooks into Emacs' built-in `completion-in-region` function, displaying completion candidates in a child frame overlay positioned near the cursor. The package targets software developers, system administrators, and technical writers who use Emacs for programming, configuration management, and text editing across multiple languages and modes. Corfu integrates with Emacs' Completion-at-Point Functions (CAPFs) and supports features like timer-based auto-completion, candidate filtering with Orderless completion style, annotation display, and keyboard navigation. It serves as a modern alternative to traditional Emacs completion interfaces, focusing on providing a polished, performance-optimized completion experience while leveraging existing Emacs completion backends rather than implementing its own.
