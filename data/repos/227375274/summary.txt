This archived repository served as the development workspace for Exercism v3, a major iteration of the programming education platform aimed at online coding skill development. The project focused on restructuring language learning tracks across 40+ programming languages including C#, Python, JavaScript, Rust, and others, implementing concept-based exercise pathways with automated feedback systems. Key technical initiatives included developing in-browser coding environments, automated solution grouping algorithms for practice exercises, and mentor-queue optimization systems. The repository coordinated cross-language track development through GitHub issue management, targeting programming educators, open-source contributors, and language track maintainers. The content was later distributed to individual language-specific repositories, with this serving as a coordination hub for the educational technology platform's comprehensive redesign focused on reducing learning bottlenecks and improving code review workflows.
