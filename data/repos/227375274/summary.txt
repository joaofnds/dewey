The `exercism/v3` repository, now archived, was a C# based project for the development of the third major iteration of the Exercism platform. This iteration aimed to restructure language tracks by introducing Concept Exercises with automated feedback and Approaches for practice exercises, alongside in-browser coding capabilities. It also included improvements to user profiles reflecting contributions. The project served as a central point for the evolution of the Exercism platform, particularly focused on the development of language tracks for programmers of various languages.
