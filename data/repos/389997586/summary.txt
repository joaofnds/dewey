`nbb` is a standalone CLI tool enabling Clojure scripting on Node.js, facilitating ad-hoc CLJS scripting with fast startup times. Its key functionalities include evaluating CLJS code through SCI, supporting first-class macros, and integrating with Node.js modules and the Clojure ecosystem via `nbb.edn`. The project utilizes Clojure (CLJS) and Node.js, leverages SCI for interpretation, supports NPM dependencies, and provides REPL and nREPL servers. This developer productivity tool is designed for developers seeking a convenient environment for scripting tasks and building TUI apps, with optional integrations for React using Reagent.
