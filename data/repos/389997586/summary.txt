nbb (Node.js babashka) is a ClojureScript scripting runtime that enables ad-hoc CLJS development on Node.js using the SCI (Small Clojure Interpreter). Targeting JavaScript developers and Clojure practitioners in full-stack web development and DevOps automation, it provides fast startup times (~170ms) and a small bundle size (1.2MB) by leveraging SCI's advanced compilation compatibility. The tool supports first-class macros, seamless NPM library integration, Clojure dependency management via babashka, and includes built-in libraries like Reagent for TUI development, promesa for promise handling, and cljs-bean for JavaScript interop. It solves the problem of complex ClojureScript build tooling by offering immediate script execution capabilities, making it ideal for automation scripts, CLI tools, and rapid prototyping where developers need Clojure's functional programming benefits within the Node.js ecosystem.
