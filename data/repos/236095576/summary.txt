Backstage is an open-source TypeScript framework for building centralized developer portals that address infrastructure complexity in microservices environments. Targeting DevOps teams and platform engineers, it provides a unified interface for managing software catalogs, service documentation, and developer tooling across distributed systems. The platform includes core modules for software cataloging, template-based project scaffolding, and integrated technical documentation (TechDocs), with an extensible plugin architecture for custom integrations. Originally developed by Spotify and now a CNCF incubation project, Backstage solves the problem of fragmented developer experience in cloud-native organizations by centralizing service discovery, documentation, and self-service capabilities into a single developer portal interface.
