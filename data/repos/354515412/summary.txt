Devzat is a custom SSH server implementation written in Go that replaces the traditional shell prompt with a real-time chat interface, targeting software developers and tech communities. The application leverages SSH's ubiquitous availability across platforms to create an accessible terminal-based chat system with features including multi-room support, direct messaging, Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting, timezone handling, and built-in games. It includes integration capabilities with Slack, Discord, and Twitter through configurable bridges, plus a plugin API for custom extensions. The system uses SSH public key authentication for user identification and supports self-hosting with administrative commands for user management. This solution addresses the need for lightweight, universally accessible developer communication tools that work across any device with SSH capability, from mobile phones to servers.
