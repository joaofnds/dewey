BullMQ is a Redis-based distributed message queue and background job processing library for Node.js and Python, targeting backend web developers and system architects building scalable applications. Written in TypeScript, it provides atomic job scheduling, processing, and management capabilities for handling asynchronous tasks like email processing, data transformation, and batch operations. The library leverages Redis for persistence and distribution, offering features like job prioritization, delayed execution, retry mechanisms, and failure handling. It serves enterprise-grade applications requiring reliable background processing, with integrations for frameworks like NestJS, solving the common problem of offloading time-intensive operations from web request cycles to maintain application responsiveness and scalability.
