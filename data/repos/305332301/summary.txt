nvim-treesitter-context is a Neovim plugin that provides persistent code context display by showing relevant parent scope lines (functions, classes, control structures) at the top of the editor window as users scroll through source files. Built for the code editor domain, it leverages Tree-sitter parsing technology to semantically understand code structure across 70+ programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, and C++. The plugin addresses the common developer problem of losing contextual awareness when navigating large codebases or deeply nested code blocks. It offers configurable display options, multiwindow support, customizable highlighting, and keyboard navigation to jump between context levels. Target users are software developers and programmers working with complex, hierarchical codebases who need to maintain awareness of their current scope position while editing or reviewing code in Neovim.
