The `metrics-server` repository provides a scalable and efficient source of container resource metrics for Kubernetes. Written in Go, it exposes container resource metrics from Kubelets through the Kubernetes Metrics API, enabling horizontal and vertical pod autoscaling. Key functionalities include rapid metric collection (every 15 seconds) and resource efficiency.  It is a standalone application designed to integrate with Kubernetes clusters, facilitating autoscaling pipelines and providing metrics for `kubectl top`. This project is a core component within the Kubernetes ecosystem, specifically for system administrators managing Kubernetes deployments and related infrastructure.
