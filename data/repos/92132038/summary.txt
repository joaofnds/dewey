The Kubernetes Metrics Server is a scalable Go-based component that collects CPU and memory resource metrics from Kubernetes Kubelets and exposes them through the Metrics API for autoscaling operations. Targeting DevOps engineers and Kubernetes administrators, it serves as the core data source for Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) pipelines, enabling automated container scaling based on resource utilization. The server integrates with the Kubernetes API aggregation layer, supports clusters up to 5,000 nodes, and collects metrics every 15 seconds with minimal resource overhead (1 millicore CPU, 2MB memory per node). It specifically addresses the need for fast, efficient autoscaling metrics in Kubernetes environments while explicitly not being designed for comprehensive monitoring or non-autoscaling use cases.
