Google Guava is a foundational Java utility library that provides enhanced collection types (multimap, multiset, immutable collections), graph data structures, and utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, and string manipulation. Targeting Java enterprise development and Android mobile development, it offers JRE (Java 8+) and Android-compatible flavors distributed via Maven/Gradle. The library addresses common Java programming inefficiencies by providing robust, well-tested alternatives to standard JDK collections and utilities, featuring comprehensive error handling, performance optimizations, and functional programming constructs. Primarily used by Java developers, software engineers, and development teams building enterprise applications, web services, and Android apps who need reliable, Google-tested foundational components for production systems.
