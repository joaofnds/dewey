Universal Ctags is a maintained C-based implementation of the ctags tool that generates indexed tag files for source code analysis across multiple programming languages. It serves the software development domain by parsing source files to create navigation indexes that enable code completion, symbol lookup, and tag jumping functionality in text editors and IDEs. Built with C and supporting various build systems (Autotools, Windows builds), it extends the original Exuberant Ctags with enhanced language parsers, regex-based custom language definitions (optlib), and experimental interactive modes. The tool addresses code navigation and analysis challenges for developers working with large codebases, providing essential infrastructure for editor plugins and development tools that require rapid symbol resolution and cross-reference capabilities across diverse programming languages.
