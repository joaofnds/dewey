`elm-ui` is an Elm library designed as a complete alternative to HTML and CSS for web application layout and styling, functioning as a design toolkit. It enables developers to construct user interfaces with Elm, aiming for simplified and error-resistant layout creation, emphasizing speed and explicit style control. The library provides layout primitives inspired by design principles and offers a declarative approach to building UI elements, replacing the need for HTML and CSS in many use cases. This is a library intended for frontend developers using the Elm programming language.
