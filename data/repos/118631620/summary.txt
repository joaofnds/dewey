elm-ui is a declarative UI library for Elm that provides a complete alternative to HTML and CSS for web frontend development. Built specifically for functional web programming, it offers a domain-specific language for layout and interface design that eliminates common CSS layout pitfalls through type-safe, composable UI elements. The library targets Elm developers building web applications who want to avoid traditional CSS complexity while maintaining explicit control over styling and layout. It compiles Elm code into optimized HTML/CSS output, featuring layout primitives like rows, columns, and element positioning that prevent layout errors at compile time. The toolkit draws inspiration from design and typography principles rather than CSS paradigms, enabling developers to construct responsive web interfaces through functional composition patterns without writing CSS manually.
