Pronto is a Ruby-based automated code review tool designed for software development workflows that performs incremental static analysis by examining only Git diff changes rather than entire codebases. It integrates with major development platforms including GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket through API-based formatters that post review comments directly on pull requests and commits. The tool operates as a modular system where pluggable runners execute various linters and analysis tools (RuboCop, Brakeman, Flay) against code changes, supporting both local development and CI/CD pipeline integration. Targeted at development teams and individual developers, Pronto addresses the need for fast, contextual code quality feedback by focusing analysis scope on modified code sections, making it particularly valuable for maintaining code standards in collaborative Git-based development environments without the performance overhead of full repository scans.
