yq is a cross-platform command-line processor for structured data formats including YAML, JSON, XML, CSV, TOML, and properties files, written in Go for zero-dependency deployment. Primarily targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers working with configuration management, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation, it provides jq-like syntax for querying, filtering, and transforming structured data files. The tool enables in-place file editing, multi-file merging, format conversion between data types, and complex data manipulation operations through a unified interface. It addresses the common DevOps challenge of programmatically manipulating configuration files, Kubernetes manifests, and structured data across different formats without requiring separate tools for each format, supporting both interactive command-line usage and scripted automation workflows.
