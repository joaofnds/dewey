`emacs-ng` is a refactoring of the Emacs text editor, aiming to modernize its architecture. It introduces features like Deno-integrated JavaScript/TypeScript support for scripting and asynchronous I/O, GPU-accelerated rendering via WebRender (Rust), and WebAssembly module compatibility. As an extension of the existing Emacs, this project utilizes Emacs Lisp for its core and integrates Rust for performance-critical components, providing a more performant and extensible editing experience. This project is a standalone application, serving as a next-generation Emacs environment for advanced users and developers seeking enhanced functionality and performance.
