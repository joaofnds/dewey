emacs-ng is a modernized fork of the Emacs text editor that integrates contemporary web technologies and GPU acceleration for developer tooling. It combines Mozilla's WebRender GPU-based rendering engine, Deno's JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with V8 engine, Rust-based async I/O using Tokio, and WebAssembly support to extend Emacs beyond traditional Elisp scripting. The project targets software developers and power users who want a high-performance, extensible editor that bridges traditional text editing with modern web development workflows. By incorporating WebWorkers for parallel JavaScript execution, GPU hardware acceleration, and cross-language module support, it addresses performance limitations and language barriers in traditional Emacs while maintaining compatibility with existing Elisp codebases and the core Emacs architecture.
