Deepstream.io is a real-time server platform built in TypeScript that provides high-performance data synchronization, pub/sub messaging, and RPC capabilities for web and mobile application developers. Inspired by financial trading technology, it offers three core primitives: records for real-time document synchronization, events for publish-subscribe messaging, and RPCs for request-response workflows, all delivered over WebSocket connections. The server includes built-in authentication mechanisms and a permission system called Valve for access control. Targeting real-time application developers building collaborative software, live dashboards, gaming platforms, or trading systems, deepstream handles data serialization, load balancing, failover, and message routing while maintaining millisecond-level synchronization across connected clients and backend services.
