This repository implements an experimental asynchronous web chat application that operates entirely without frontend JavaScript, serving as a proof-of-concept for alternative web development techniques. Built with Ruby backend and leveraging CSS pseudo-selectors with background-image loading for user input detection, it uses HTTP chunked transfer encoding and Comet-style long-polling to achieve real-time message updates. The system employs Redis pub/sub for inter-thread communication and dynamically replaces CSS styles to update the UI state. Targeted at web developers interested in unconventional frontend architectures, this project demonstrates creative exploitation of browser behavior and HTTP protocol features to achieve modern web application functionality through non-standard methods, highlighting the boundaries and possibilities of CSS-only interactive web interfaces.
