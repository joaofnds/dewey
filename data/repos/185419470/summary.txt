`kkuchta/css-only-chat` is a web application implementing an asynchronous chat functionality using CSS on the frontend, without Javascript. The application uses background images loaded via pseudo-selectors to trigger server requests, and a "forever-loading" index page leveraging `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` for continuous HTML updates, enabling real-time message display.  The backend is likely implemented in Ruby, utilizing Redis pubsub for inter-thread communication and includes an installation guide. This project serves as a demonstration and exploration of web technology constraints.
