vim-exchange is a Vim Script plugin that implements a text exchange operator for the Vim text editor, enabling users to swap two arbitrary regions of text through a two-step motion-based workflow. Targeting software developers, system administrators, and technical writers who use Vim for code editing and text manipulation, the plugin provides operators (`cx`, `cxx`, `X`, `cxc`) that follow Vim's modal editing paradigm to mark and exchange text objects, words, lines, or visual selections. It solves the common text editing problem of swapping non-adjacent code blocks, variable names, or text segments without requiring complex cut-paste operations or temporary buffers. The plugin integrates seamlessly with Vim's native motion system and repeat functionality, and has been ported to other editors' Vim emulation layers including Emacs (evil-mode), Atom, IntelliJ, and Zsh vi-mode.
