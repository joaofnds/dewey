Inertia.js is a TypeScript-based web development framework that bridges server-side and client-side architectures by enabling developers to build single-page applications using React, Vue, or Svelte frontends while maintaining traditional server-side routing and controller patterns. It eliminates the need for separate REST APIs or GraphQL endpoints by allowing server-side controllers to directly render frontend components, streamlining the development workflow for full-stack web applications. The framework targets web developers working on modern web applications who want to leverage client-side interactivity without abandoning familiar server-side MVC patterns, particularly those using backend frameworks like Laravel, Rails, or Django that support traditional routing architectures.
