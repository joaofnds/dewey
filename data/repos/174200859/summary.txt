Inertia.js is a TypeScript library facilitating the creation of modern single-page applications (SPAs) using React, Vue, and Svelte, while leveraging server-side routing and controllers. This framework aims to streamline the development process by bridging the gap between traditional server-side application architectures and the user experience of modern frontend frameworks. It acts as a developer productivity tool, allowing for rapid development of SPAs with a focus on server-driven functionality. The project provides tooling and architecture for integrating server-side logic with popular frontend JavaScript frameworks.
