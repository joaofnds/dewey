cljfmt is a code formatting tool specifically designed for the Clojure programming language ecosystem. It automatically detects and fixes formatting inconsistencies in Clojure source code according to established community style guidelines, primarily the Clojure Style Guide. The tool integrates with popular Clojure development workflows through Leiningen plugins, Clojure CLI tools, standalone binaries, and as a library dependency. It targets Clojure developers who need to maintain consistent code formatting across projects and teams, offering configurable indentation rules and formatting options while preserving existing code structure. Unlike comprehensive code restructuring tools, cljfmt focuses on minimal corrective changes to fix formatting errors rather than complete code transformation, making it suitable for maintaining code quality in Clojure development environments.
