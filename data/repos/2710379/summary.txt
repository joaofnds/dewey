editorconfig-emacs is an Emacs Lisp plugin that integrates EditorConfig support into the Emacs text editor, enabling automatic enforcement of consistent coding standards across multi-developer projects. Targeting software developers and development teams working in polyglot environments, it automatically applies project-specific formatting rules (indentation style, tab width, line endings, character encoding, trailing whitespace handling) by parsing .editorconfig files when opening source code files. The plugin provides a global minor mode that hooks into Emacs' file-visiting mechanisms, supporting major programming modes and offering customization through Emacs' native configuration system. It solves the common development problem of maintaining consistent code formatting across different editors, IDEs, and team members by leveraging the EditorConfig standard specification for cross-editor compatibility.
