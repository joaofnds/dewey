magit-todos is an Emacs Lisp extension that integrates TODO comment scanning into Magit, the popular Git interface for Emacs. It automatically parses source code files and Org documents to extract TODO, FIXME, and other task-related comments, displaying them directly within Magit's status buffer for enhanced project visibility. The package supports multiple scanning backends including ripgrep, git grep with PCRE, and GNU grep, and offers advanced features like grouping, branch-specific filtering, and integration with Helm/Ivy completion frameworks. Built on Emacs Lisp with dependencies on magit, hl-todo, and async processing libraries, it addresses the common developer workflow challenge of tracking scattered code annotations across Git repositories. The tool targets Emacs-using software developers working in Git-based projects who need consolidated visibility into their codebase's embedded task management comments without leaving their primary development environment.
