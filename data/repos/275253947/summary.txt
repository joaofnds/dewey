This repository is a comprehensive documentation guide for integrating Lua programming into Neovim text editor configuration and plugin development. Targeting software developers and Neovim users transitioning from Vimscript to Lua, it addresses the learning gap for writing Neovim plugins and configurations using Lua as a first-class language. The guide covers core technical aspects including Lua module system integration, file organization within Neovim's runtime path structure, interoperability between Lua and Vimscript, and practical implementation patterns for editor customization. It serves the developer tools and text editor ecosystem, specifically focusing on Neovim's embedded LuaJIT 2.1.0 environment, and provides essential knowledge for developers seeking to leverage Lua's performance and simplicity for editor automation, plugin development, and advanced Neovim configuration management.
