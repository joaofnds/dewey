RSS-Bridge is a PHP web application designed to generate RSS and Atom feeds for websites that lack native feed support. It functions as a bridge, extracting content from various web sources using a modular architecture of "bridges" specific to different websites, allowing users to create feeds for platforms like social media, news sites, and other content providers. The application is built in PHP (minimum 7.4) and utilizes third-party libraries like Simple HTML DOM Parser. This standalone web application targets users seeking to aggregate and monitor content from diverse online sources that don't natively support feed formats.
