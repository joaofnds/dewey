RSS-Bridge is a PHP web application that generates RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds for websites lacking native syndication capabilities. Built for web developers, content aggregators, and system administrators, it operates through a modular bridge architecture with 447+ specialized scrapers for platforms like YouTube, Reddit, Mastodon, TikTok, and Twitter. The application leverages PHP's cURL, SimpleXML, and DOM parsing libraries to extract content using CSS selectors and XPath expressions, then transforms it into standardized feed formats. It addresses the content syndication gap in modern web platforms that have abandoned RSS support, enabling automated content monitoring and aggregation workflows. The system requires PHP 7.4+ and can be deployed on traditional shared hosting or modern LAMP/LEMP stacks.
