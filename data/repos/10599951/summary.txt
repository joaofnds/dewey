The Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata is a software engineering educational repository designed for practicing legacy code refactoring and test-driven development techniques. This multi-language kata provides starting code implementations across various programming languages (including XSLT as indicated) that simulate an inventory management system for a fictional shop with complex business rules governing item quality degradation over time. The repository serves software developers, technical coaches, and programming instructors who want to practice safe refactoring methodologies, unit testing strategies, and approval testing approaches. It includes TextTest fixtures for approval testing, failing unit tests as starting points, and comprehensive requirements documentation in multiple languages. The kata emphasizes incremental refactoring techniques rather than complete rewrites, making it valuable for developers learning to work with legacy codebases and improve code maintainability while preserving existing functionality through disciplined testing practices.
