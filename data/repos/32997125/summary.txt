`git-cipher` is a Ruby script designed for securely storing encrypted files within a Git repository, specifically addressing the need to version-control sensitive data in public repositories. It provides command-line tools for encrypting, decrypting, logging plaintext diffs, listing encrypted files, and checking status. The tool leverages GnuPG for encryption, offering a single-file executable, which is advantageous for environments without RubyGems. Primarily a developer productivity tool, it targets developers managing configuration files or other sensitive information within version control systems.
