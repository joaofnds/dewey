`git-cipher` is a Ruby-based command-line utility that provides seamless encryption and decryption of sensitive files for secure storage in Git repositories using GPG (GnuPG) cryptography. Designed for DevOps and infrastructure automation workflows, particularly Ansible configuration management, it addresses the challenge of version-controlling sensitive data like SSH keys, credentials, and configuration files without exposing plaintext secrets in public repositories. The tool encrypts files with `.encrypted` extensions, supports multiple GPG recipients, and offers Git-like subcommands for status tracking, logging with plaintext diffs, and file management. Target users include system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers managing infrastructure-as-code who need to maintain security while preserving the benefits of Git version control for sensitive configuration data.
