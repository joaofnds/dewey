Mail is a comprehensive Ruby library for email handling that provides RFC5322 and RFC6532 compliant email generation, parsing, and transmission capabilities. Designed for web developers and Ruby applications requiring email functionality, it serves as a unified interface for all email operations including SMTP sending, POP3/IMAP receiving, and MIME multipart message processing. The library handles modern text encodings, supports UTF-8 headers, and provides object-oriented access to email components while wrapping standard Ruby networking libraries like Net::SMTP and Net::POP3. It addresses the core problem of robust email handling in Ruby applications, replacing older solutions like TMail with better encoding support and cleaner API design for developers building email-enabled web applications and services.
