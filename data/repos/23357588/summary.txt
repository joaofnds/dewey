Protocol Buffers is Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral serialization framework for structured data interchange across distributed systems and applications. Built primarily in C++, it provides a protocol compiler (protoc) that generates language-specific code from .proto schema definitions, along with runtime libraries for C++, Java, Python, C#, Ruby, Objective-C, and Go. The system addresses efficient binary serialization, deserialization, and marshalling for RPC communications, microservices architectures, and cross-platform data exchange where JSON/XML overhead is prohibitive. Target users include backend developers, distributed systems engineers, and API architects requiring high-performance, schema-evolved data serialization with strong typing and backward compatibility guarantees across heterogeneous technology stacks.
