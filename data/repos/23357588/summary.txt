Protocol Buffers (protobuf) is a Google-developed, language-neutral, and platform-neutral mechanism for serializing structured data. This C++ library and associated compiler (protoc) enable the definition of data structures in `.proto` files, which are then compiled into code for various programming languages (C++, Java, Python, etc.) for data interchange. Key features include efficient data serialization, RPC (Remote Procedure Call) capabilities, and support for evolving data schemas. The project serves as a library, a compiler (protoc) and provides runtimes for various programming languages, targeting developers needing to serialize, transmit, and deserialize structured data in a performant and interoperable manner.
