VCR is a Ruby testing library that intercepts and records HTTP requests made during test execution, storing them as "cassettes" in YAML or JSON format for replay in subsequent test runs. It integrates with popular Ruby HTTP libraries (Net::HTTP, Faraday, Typhoeus, Excon) and testing frameworks (RSpec, Cucumber, Test::Unit) through stubbing mechanisms like WebMock. The library enables fast, deterministic, and offline-capable test suites by eliminating real HTTP calls after initial recording, while maintaining response accuracy. VCR supports configurable request matching, sensitive data filtering, dynamic ERB responses, and automatic cassette refresh intervals. It primarily serves Ruby web developers building applications that consume external APIs, allowing them to create reliable integration tests without dependencies on external services or network connectivity.
