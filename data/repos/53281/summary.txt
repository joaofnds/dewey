Common Lisp Statistics (CLS) is a statistical computing library for Common Lisp that modernizes the classic LispStat system with design principles borrowed from R. It targets data scientists and statisticians who prefer Lisp environments for statistical analysis and numerical computing. The library integrates with low-level mathematical libraries including BLAS, LAPACK, and GSL for high-performance linear algebra operations, and depends on supporting packages like lisp-matrix and ANTIK for mathematical data structures. CLS addresses the need for a contemporary statistical computing platform in Common Lisp, providing matrix operations, statistical functions, and data analysis capabilities. It runs on SBCL and CCL implementations across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms, requiring manual configuration of native mathematical library paths for optimal performance.
