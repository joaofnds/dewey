nvim-lspinstall is a Lua-based Neovim plugin that provides automated installation and management of Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers for software development environments. It extends nvim-lspconfig by adding the missing `:LspInstall` command, enabling developers to programmatically install language servers for 30+ programming languages including Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, C++, and others directly into Neovim's local data directory. The plugin solves the dependency management problem for LSP servers by bundling installation scripts that automatically download and configure language servers from various sources including npm packages, GitHub releases, and VSCode extensions. It targets software developers and DevOps engineers working across multiple programming languages who need consistent, reproducible LSP server installations without relying on system package managers or manual configuration.
