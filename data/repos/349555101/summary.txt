`nvim-lspinstall` is a Lua plugin for Neovim that streamlines the installation and management of Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers. It provides the `:LspInstall <language>` command for installing and updating language servers locally, integrating seamlessly with `nvim-lspconfig`.  Functionality includes automatic server reloading after installation and a Lua API for configuration and server management, supporting numerous language servers like Python, Go, and JavaScript. The project's architecture centers around Lua scripting within Neovim, utilizing `nvim-lspconfig` for server setup, and targets Neovim users seeking an efficient workflow for language server configuration and management within their editor.
