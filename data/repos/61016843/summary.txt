LiquidJS is a JavaScript/TypeScript implementation of the Liquid template engine, designed for web developers building static site generators, content management systems, and e-commerce platforms. It provides full compatibility with Shopify's Liquid templating language and GitHub Pages/Jekyll, enabling server-side and client-side template rendering in Node.js and browser environments. The engine processes Liquid syntax including tags (`{% %}`) and output expressions (`{{ }}`) with built-in filters, conditionals, and loops for dynamic content generation. Primarily targeting frontend developers and static site generator maintainers, it solves the cross-platform portability problem for Liquid templates, allowing Jekyll sites and Shopify themes to run natively in JavaScript environments without Ruby dependencies.
