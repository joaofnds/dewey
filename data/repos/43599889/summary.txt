class-validator is a TypeScript validation library designed for web development that enables decorator-based property validation for JavaScript/TypeScript classes. Built on top of validator.js, it provides a comprehensive set of validation decorators (@IsEmail, @Length, @IsInt, etc.) that developers can apply directly to class properties to enforce data integrity constraints. The library supports both synchronous and asynchronous validation, nested object validation, conditional validation, custom validators, and validation groups, making it particularly valuable for backend API development, form validation, and data transfer object (DTO) validation in Node.js and browser environments. It targets TypeScript/JavaScript developers building applications that require robust input validation and data sanitization, offering both decorator-based and schema-based validation approaches with detailed error reporting and internationalization support.
