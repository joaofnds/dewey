`class-validator` is a TypeScript library providing decorator-based property validation for classes, primarily targeting backend and full-stack TypeScript developers. It leverages the `validator.js` library internally, enabling both decorator-based and non-decorator validation methods. Key features include validating various data types, nested objects, and arrays, alongside support for custom validation rules, validation groups, and conditional validation logic. It functions as a library, enabling integration into applications needing data validation and integrates with platforms like Node.js and browsers.
