particles.js is a lightweight JavaScript library for creating animated particle systems in web browsers using HTML5 Canvas rendering. Targeted at front-end web developers and UI/UX designers, it generates configurable particle effects for website backgrounds and interactive elements. The library supports multiple particle shapes (circles, polygons, images), connection lines between particles, animation controls, and user interaction modes (hover, click events). Built with vanilla JavaScript for broad compatibility, it offers JSON-based configuration for particle density, movement patterns, opacity, colors, and physics behaviors. The library solves the problem of creating visually engaging particle animations without requiring complex graphics programming knowledge, enabling developers to easily implement modern animated backgrounds and decorative effects in web applications through a simple API and extensive customization options.
