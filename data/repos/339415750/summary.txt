`emacs-prisma-mode` is an Emacs major mode designed to provide syntax highlighting, auto-indentation, and Language Server Protocol (LSP) support for Prisma schema files. It is implemented in Emacs Lisp and intended to enhance the editing experience for developers working with Prisma schemas within the Emacs text editor. Users install this plugin as a package or by manually loading the code. It depends on the `lsp-mode` package for its LSP functionality, providing code completion and other advanced features. This project functions as an Emacs plugin, specifically targeting Emacs users who work with Prisma, a database toolkit.
