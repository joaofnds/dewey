emacs-prisma-mode is an Emacs major mode that provides IDE-like functionality for editing Prisma schema files, targeting web developers working with database ORM tooling. Built in Emacs Lisp, it integrates with lsp-mode to deliver syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, and Language Server Protocol support for Prisma's database schema definition language. The mode addresses the need for proper editor support when defining database models, relations, and migrations in Prisma-based applications, which are commonly used in modern web development with Node.js, TypeScript, and full-stack JavaScript frameworks. It enables backend developers and full-stack engineers to efficiently write and maintain database schemas with proper code completion, error detection, and formatting within the Emacs ecosystem.
