Poetry is a Python package and dependency management tool that modernizes Python project configuration by replacing traditional files (setup.py, requirements.txt, setup.cfg, MANIFEST.in, Pipfile) with a unified pyproject.toml-based approach. Built for Python developers and DevOps engineers, it provides comprehensive dependency resolution, virtual environment management, and package publishing capabilities while supporting advanced features like dependency groups, version constraints, Git dependencies, and optional extras. The tool addresses Python packaging complexity by offering deterministic builds through lock files, simplified project bootstrapping, and PEP 517-compliant build systems, making it essential for modern Python development workflows across web development, data science, and enterprise software projects.
