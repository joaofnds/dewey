org-sidebar is an Emacs extension that provides customizable sidebar interfaces for Org mode buffers, primarily targeting productivity-focused developers and researchers who use Emacs for task management and document organization. Built using Emacs Lisp with integration to org-ql query language and org-super-agenda grouping, it renders two main sidebar types: a chronological task sidebar displaying scheduled/deadlined items and todo lists filtered by customizable queries, and a tree-view sidebar for outline navigation and hierarchical document structure visualization. The package addresses the problem of efficiently navigating and managing complex Org mode documents by providing persistent, context-aware sidebars that respect buffer narrowing and offer mouse/keyboard interactions for rapid task switching and document traversal within the Emacs ecosystem.
