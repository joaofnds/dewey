The `universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx` is a Java-based standalone application, a fork of the Universal Pokemon Randomizer, designed for modifying and randomizing various Pokemon game ROMs. It provides features to alter in-game elements, including but not limited to item locations, trainer teams, and Pokemon encounters, supporting numerous games across multiple platforms, including 3DS titles. This project's codebase includes a GUI, allowing users to configure randomization settings and apply them to game ROM files. Developers contribute fixes and improvements to the original Universal Pokemon Randomizer, including new features and support for more games.
