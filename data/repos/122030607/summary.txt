`gotop` is a terminal-based, cross-platform system monitoring application providing a graphical interface for resource usage visualization. Written in Go, it draws inspiration from `gtop` and `vtop`, offering real-time CPU, memory, and process monitoring, including mouse interaction for process selection and navigation via keybindings. The application features customizable colorschemes and supports installation via source, prebuilt binaries, and package managers like Arch Linux's AUR, FreeBSD's pkg, Homebrew, and Snap. Its core functionality revolves around providing system administrators and developers with an interactive CLI tool for monitoring and managing system resources.
