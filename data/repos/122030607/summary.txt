gotop is a terminal-based system monitoring tool written in Go that provides real-time graphical visualization of system resources including CPU usage, memory consumption, network activity, disk I/O, and running processes. Designed for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers working in Unix-like environments (Linux, macOS, FreeBSD), it serves as a lightweight alternative to traditional GUI system monitors by operating entirely within terminal sessions. The application leverages gizak/termui for terminal UI rendering, shirou/gopsutil for cross-platform system metrics collection, and termbox-go for keyboard/mouse input handling. It addresses the need for efficient system resource monitoring in headless servers, SSH sessions, and terminal-centric workflows where GUI tools are unavailable or impractical, offering features like process management, customizable colorschemes, and interactive navigation controls.
