The `opentofu/manifesto` repository houses the OpenTF Manifesto, a document advocating for the return of Terraform to a truly open-source license. Its core purpose is to address concerns regarding HashiCorp's licensing change and promote community-driven development of Terraform. This project provides the manifesto text and links to the OpenTF website and fork. It functions as a static document, primarily targeting the infrastructure-as-code community and any stakeholders interested in the future of the Terraform project. It is written in HTML and intended for informational purposes.
