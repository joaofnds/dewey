This repository hosts the OpenTF Manifesto, a community-driven advocacy document addressing HashiCorp's licensing change of Terraform from Mozilla Public License to Business Source License (BSL). Built as a static HTML website, it serves the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps community by documenting concerns about proprietary licensing restrictions and promoting the OpenTofu fork as an open-source alternative. The manifesto targets DevOps engineers, platform engineers, SREs, and infrastructure practitioners who rely on Terraform for cloud resource provisioning and infrastructure management. It addresses vendor lock-in concerns and licensing restrictions that impact enterprise adoption, CI/CD pipelines, and collaborative development workflows in cloud infrastructure automation, advocating for maintaining open-source accessibility in critical DevOps tooling.
