The `golang-lru` repository provides a thread-safe, fixed-size Least Recently Used (LRU) cache implementation for Go. It offers core functionality for storing and retrieving data with automatic eviction of less recently accessed items to maintain a specified capacity.  The library includes both standard and expirable LRU cache implementations, enabling time-based key expiration.  This Go library is designed for developers and is suitable for use cases requiring efficient in-memory caching within Go applications.
