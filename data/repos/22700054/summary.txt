This Go library provides thread-safe LRU (Least Recently Used) cache implementations for Golang applications, offering both standard fixed-size caching and time-based expirable variants. Built on Groupcache foundations, it serves backend developers and systems engineers working on high-performance applications requiring in-memory caching solutions. The package addresses memory management challenges in distributed systems, web services, and data processing pipelines where frequently accessed data needs efficient storage with automatic eviction policies. It features generic type support for Go 1.18+, configurable TTL expiration, and concurrent access safety, making it suitable for microservices architectures, API gateways, and caching layers in enterprise software development where reducing database load and improving response times are critical.
