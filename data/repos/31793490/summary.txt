The `dactyl-keyboard` repository provides a parameterized design and generation framework for ergonomic, split-hand, columnar keyboards. Built using OpenSCAD, the project leverages Clojure scripts for generating the 3D models. Users can modify the design parameters within the Clojure files and generate STL files for 3D printing, with pre-generated STL files also available. The project includes resources for PCB design and wiring, as well as a rough guide for assembly. It is a project for generating physical designs, primarily targeting individuals interested in building custom ergonomic keyboards.
