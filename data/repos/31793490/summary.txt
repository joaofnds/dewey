This repository provides a parameterized 3D model generator for ergonomic split keyboards using Clojure and OpenSCAD. The Dactyl keyboard features a concave, columnar layout designed to reduce finger strain through natural hand positioning. The codebase uses Clojure's functional programming capabilities to generate customizable OpenSCAD files, which are then compiled to STL files for 3D printing. It targets DIY keyboard enthusiasts, makers, and hardware developers interested in custom ergonomic input devices. The repository includes flexible PCB mask designs for electronic assembly and pre-generated STL files for immediate fabrication. This solution addresses the mechanical keyboard and assistive technology domains by enabling rapid prototyping of personalized ergonomic keyboards through parametric design, eliminating the need for traditional CAD modeling skills.
