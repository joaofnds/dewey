AlDente is a macOS menu bar application written in Swift designed to manage and limit the maximum charging percentage of a MacBook's battery to extend its lifespan. Key features include a user-configurable charge limiter, allowing users to set thresholds between 20% and 100%, and a discharge function to allow the MacBook to run on battery power even when plugged in. The application leverages the SMCKit library and LaunchAtLogin for system interaction and automatic startup, and targets users seeking to optimize their MacBook's battery health by preventing overcharging. This is a standalone GUI application.
