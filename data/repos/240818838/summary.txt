AlDente is a macOS menu bar utility built in Swift that provides battery charge management for MacBook users. The application interfaces with low-level system functions through SMCKit to control lithium-ion battery charging behavior, allowing users to set maximum charge limits between 20-100% and force battery discharge while plugged in. It targets the hardware optimization and system administration domain, specifically addressing battery longevity concerns by preventing constant 100% charging states that can degrade Li-Ion batteries. The tool integrates with macOS system APIs and requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later, serving power users, system administrators, and laptop enthusiasts who want to extend their MacBook's battery lifespan through intelligent charge cycle management rather than relying solely on the operating system's default charging behavior.
