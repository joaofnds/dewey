**pfetch** is a lightweight system information utility written in POSIX-compliant shell script, designed for system administrators, Linux enthusiasts, and terminal users who need quick hardware and OS details. It serves as a minimalist alternative to neofetch and screenfetch in the system monitoring and terminal customization domain. The tool detects and displays system information including OS distribution, kernel version, uptime, memory usage, and package counts across multiple Unix-like platforms (Linux distributions, BSD variants, macOS, Solaris, Haiku). Built entirely in portable shell script without external dependencies, it emphasizes performance and compatibility while providing configurable ASCII art logos and color schemes. The utility addresses the need for fast, dependency-free system profiling in DevOps workflows, system administration tasks, and terminal rice configurations.
