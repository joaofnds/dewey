`Environ` is a Clojure library designed for managing environment variables and configuration settings within Clojure applications, particularly those adhering to the 12-Factor App methodology. It provides a unified interface for accessing settings from multiple sources, including `.lein-env` and `.boot-env` files, environment variables, and Java system properties, with precedence defined. The library automatically converts environment variable keys to Clojure keywords, simplifying access. This developer productivity tool functions as a library providing the core functionality of integrating environment variables into a Clojure project.
