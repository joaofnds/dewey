Environ is a Clojure library designed for managing environment-specific configuration settings in Clojure applications, particularly those following the 12 Factor App methodology. It provides a unified interface for retrieving configuration values from multiple sources including `.lein-env` files, `.boot-env` files, system environment variables, and Java system properties, with a defined resolution order. The library integrates with Clojure build tools (Leiningen and Boot) to facilitate development-to-production configuration management, automatically handling key normalization by converting underscores and dots to hyphens and lowercasing. Target users are Clojure developers building web applications and services who need to manage different database connections, API keys, and other environment-specific settings across development, testing, and production environments without hardcoding values or manually managing configuration files.
