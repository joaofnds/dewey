Apache Hadoop is a distributed computing framework written in Java that enables storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of commodity hardware. It implements the MapReduce programming model for parallel processing and includes the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for fault-tolerant data storage. Targeting the big data analytics domain, Hadoop solves scalability challenges in processing petabyte-scale datasets that exceed single-machine capabilities. The framework utilizes Java-based APIs, supports various data formats, and integrates with ecosystem tools like Hive, HBase, and Spark. Primary users include data engineers, system administrators, and data scientists working in enterprise environments requiring distributed data processing, ETL operations, and large-scale analytics workloads across industries like finance, telecommunications, and technology.
