Automerge-classic is a deprecated JavaScript implementation of Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) that provides JSON-like data structures for building collaborative applications. The library enables multiple users to concurrently modify shared documents in distributed, offline-first environments, automatically merging changes without conflicts when systems reconnect. Built in pure JavaScript with browser and Node.js compatibility, it targets web developers creating real-time collaborative applications such as document editors, project management tools, or multiplayer applications where users need to work simultaneously on shared data. The library handles the complex distributed systems challenges of maintaining data consistency across multiple clients without requiring centralized coordination, making it particularly valuable for applications that must function reliably in offline scenarios or unreliable network conditions.
