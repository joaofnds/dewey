Piknik is a secure network clipboard utility written in Go that enables encrypted copy/paste operations across distributed systems and networks. Targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators, it solves the problem of transferring text, code snippets, and files between hosts separated by NAT gateways or firewalls without requiring SSH access. The tool implements end-to-end encryption using pre-shared keys (PSK) and digital signatures, routing clipboard data through a configurable staging server while ensuring the server cannot decrypt the transmitted content. It supports cross-platform deployment (Linux, macOS, Windows, BSD variants) and uses TOML configuration files for key management, making it particularly valuable for infrastructure teams managing remote systems and multi-host development environments.
