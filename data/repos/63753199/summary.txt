`piknik` is a standalone, command-line application written in Go that facilitates secure copy-paste functionality across a network. It addresses the need for a network-aware clipboard, enabling the transfer of arbitrary data, including text and files, between hosts regardless of network topology (e.g., behind NAT).  The core functionality relies on end-to-end encryption and transit through a staging server to bypass firewall restrictions, with features including key generation, configuration via a `piknik.toml` file, and support for various operating systems.  It is a CLI tool that leverages cryptographic protocols (Ed25519, XChaCha20) for secure data transfer, targeting users requiring a secure and flexible method for data sharing across networks.
