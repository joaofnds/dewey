This repository contains the Ruby on Rails web application that powers Exercism, an online coding education platform. Built for the education technology domain, it serves as the primary web interface where developers learn programming through practice exercises and mentorship. The application uses a comprehensive technology stack including Ruby 3.3.0, MySQL and MongoDB for data persistence, Redis for caching, AnyCable-Go for real-time features, and integrates with AWS services via localstack for development. It addresses the core problem of delivering interactive coding education at scale, handling user authentication, exercise delivery, code submission processing, mentor-student interactions, and progress tracking. The platform targets software developers seeking to improve their programming skills across multiple languages, with the Rails application serving as the central hub orchestrating the learning experience and community interactions.
