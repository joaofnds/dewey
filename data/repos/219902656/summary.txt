nestjs-query is a TypeScript-based CRUD automation framework specifically designed for GraphQL APIs in the web development domain. It provides a collection of packages that eliminate boilerplate code for common GraphQL resolver patterns including querying, sorting, filtering, and pagination operations. The framework integrates with the NestJS ecosystem and supports multiple ORM backends including TypeORM, Sequelize, and Mongoose for database operations across SQL and MongoDB databases. It targets backend developers building GraphQL APIs who need to rapidly implement standardized CRUD operations without manually writing repetitive resolver logic, service layers, and query handling code. The modular architecture separates core interfaces, GraphQL resolver generation, and ORM-specific implementations, enabling developers to quickly scaffold feature-complete GraphQL endpoints with type-safe operations while maintaining flexibility for custom business logic.
