Nestjs-query is a TypeScript library designed to simplify CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for GraphQL APIs within the NestJS framework. It provides packages to streamline the creation of GraphQL resolvers and associated data access services, particularly for querying, sorting, and paging of data. Key functionalities include decorators and services compatible with TypeORM and Sequelize, facilitating seamless integration with various database backends like MongoDB (implied by the keywords) and others. This is a developer productivity library that simplifies the backend implementation by providing an easier CRUD management system and targets backend developers building applications on the NestJS framework.
