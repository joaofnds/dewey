Jbuilder is a Ruby library designed for generating JSON structures using a domain-specific language (DSL), offering an alternative to manual hash manipulation, especially when dealing with complex conditional logic and loops. Its core functionality includes methods for defining attributes, nested structures, and arrays, along with features for merging existing data, handling top-level arrays, and utilizing partials for code reusability. Rails integration is a key aspect, allowing direct use within ActionView templates, and supporting caching and key formatting options. It is a library specifically aimed at Ruby on Rails developers for JSON generation in web applications.
