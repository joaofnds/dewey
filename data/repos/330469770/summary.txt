What-anime-cli is a command-line tool written in Go that enables anime fans and developers to identify anime series and episodes from image files or URLs. The application serves as a wrapper around the trace.moe API, leveraging reverse image search capabilities to match screenshots or scenes to their source anime. Built using Go's standard libraries for HTTP requests and image processing, it supports multiple image formats (JPG, PNG, JFIF, WebP, GIF) and provides both local file and remote URL input methods. The tool targets anime enthusiasts, content creators, and developers working in media identification domains who need programmatic access to anime scene recognition through terminal-based workflows, eliminating the need for web-based interfaces when identifying anime sources from visual content.
