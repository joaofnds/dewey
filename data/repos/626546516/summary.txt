Crab is a community-driven fork of a systems programming language, aiming to provide memory safety and eliminate bureaucratic overhead. This repository contains the compiler, standard library, and documentation for CrabLang, enabling users to build software. Written in Rust, the project utilizes a custom build system (`x.py`) and supports installation and building on Unix-like systems and Windows, with cross-compilation options. It is primarily a toolchain and associated documentation and is intended for developers interested in systems programming.
