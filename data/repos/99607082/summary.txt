**skhd** is a lightweight C-based hotkey daemon specifically designed for macOS system administration and power user workflow automation. Built using macOS Accessibility APIs and launchd service integration, it provides a DSL-based configuration system for defining global keyboard shortcuts that can execute shell commands, synthesize keypresses, or manage application-specific key bindings. The daemon features hot-reloading configuration, modal hotkey systems, application blacklisting, and media key integration, targeting system administrators, developers, and macOS power users who need programmatic control over system-wide keyboard shortcuts. It solves the problem of limited native macOS hotkey customization by providing a performant, text-file-driven approach to global key binding management that integrates seamlessly with window managers and automation tools in the macOS ecosystem.
