`skhd` is a standalone hotkey daemon for macOS, written in C, designed for responsiveness and performance. It allows users to define custom hotkeys via a configuration file using a simple DSL, supporting hotloading, modal hotkey systems, and application-specific keybindings.  Key features include the ability to synthesize keypresses, pass through hotkeys, and specify application blacklists.  The project is a command-line application that leverages a pid-file for single instance control and provides options for service installation via launchd.
