massCode is a cross-platform code snippets manager built for software developers using Electron, Vue.js, and Monaco editor. The application addresses the developer productivity challenge of organizing, storing, and retrieving reusable code fragments across projects. It provides a desktop GUI with multi-level folder hierarchy, tagging system, and tabbed fragments for granular snippet organization. The Monaco editor integration delivers VS Code-level features including IntelliSense, syntax validation for TypeScript/JavaScript/CSS/HTML/JSON, Emmet support, and Prettier code formatting. Targeting developers across web development, DevOps, and general programming domains, massCode runs natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux, serving as a local alternative to cloud-based snippet managers while maintaining the advanced editing capabilities developers expect from modern IDEs.
