Agenda is a TypeScript-based job scheduling library for Node.js applications that provides persistent task management using MongoDB as the backend storage layer. This modern rewrite of the original agenda.js targets Node.js developers building web applications and distributed systems requiring reliable background job processing. The library supports cron-based scheduling, recurring tasks, job prioritization, concurrency control, and database-backed persistence with MongoDB sharding capabilities. Key features include promise-based APIs, configurable job retries, progress tracking, and real-time job monitoring through optional REST API and web dashboard integrations. Agenda solves the problem of reliable asynchronous task execution in Node.js environments, particularly for web developers needing to handle email notifications, data processing, cleanup tasks, and other scheduled operations in production applications.
