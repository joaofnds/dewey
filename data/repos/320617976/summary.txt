This repository served as the organizational hub for the CNCF GitOps Working Group, a specialized working group under the CNCF Application Delivery Technical Advisory Group focused on standardizing GitOps practices and methodologies. The repository has been superseded and its contents migrated to two primary locations: the cncf/tag-app-delivery repository for ongoing working group activities, and the OpenGitOps project repositories for lasting documentation, specifications, and tooling. The working group targeted DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and cloud-native practitioners implementing GitOps workflows for continuous deployment and infrastructure-as-code management. It addressed the standardization of GitOps principles, best practices, and interoperability across Kubernetes-native deployment tools like ArgoCD, Flux, and Jenkins X, solving fragmentation in GitOps implementation approaches within cloud-native ecosystems.
