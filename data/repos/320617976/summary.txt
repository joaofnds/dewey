This repository, now superseded, formerly served as the CNCF GitOps Working Group's primary location. It focused on GitOps, a software development practice utilizing Git as the source of truth for infrastructure and application definitions. Its content, including documents and code, has been migrated to the cncf/tag-app-delivery and open-gitops repositories. The project's core purpose was to facilitate and promote GitOps best practices and related projects within the cloud native ecosystem.
