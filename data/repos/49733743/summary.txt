Git Draw is a Chrome extension that enables developers to create pixel art drawings on their GitHub contribution heatmap by generating scripted git commit histories. Built in JavaScript, it bypasses GitHub's Content Security Policy restrictions that would prevent a bookmarklet implementation. The tool provides an interactive drawing interface overlaid on the GitHub heatmap, then exports the artwork as a shell script containing timestamped git commits. When executed and pushed to a repository, these commits manipulate the contribution graph to visually represent the drawn design. This targets developers and GitHub users interested in customizing their profile's visual presentation through commit history manipulation, solving the technical challenge of programmatically generating specific contribution patterns while working within GitHub's security constraints.
