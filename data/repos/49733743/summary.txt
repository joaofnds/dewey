`git-draw` is a Chrome extension enabling users to visually create drawings within their GitHub contribution heatmap.  The extension generates a script containing a git commit log based on the user's drawing, allowing for customized heatmap visualizations when applied to a new Git repository. Developed using JavaScript, it circumvents GitHub's Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions that make bookmarklet implementations impractical. This developer productivity tool leverages the browser extension architecture.
