TerminalTextEffects (TTE) is a Python-based terminal visual effects engine that provides animated text effects for command-line interfaces and terminal applications. Built using standard ANSI escape sequences without external dependencies, it targets developers, system administrators, and CLI tool creators who want to enhance terminal user experiences with dynamic visual feedback. The library supports Xterm 256/RGB color schemes, complex character animations through path-based movement with bezier curves, scene management with layering and easing functions, and gradient generation. TTE functions both as a standalone CLI application and as an embeddable Python library, offering 30+ built-in effects including matrix rain, fireworks, and spotlight animations. It addresses the need for engaging visual feedback in terminal-based applications, DevOps tooling, and system administration scripts while maintaining compatibility with modern terminal emulators.
