`terminaltexteffects` is a Python library, application, and visual effects engine designed to render text-based animations and effects directly within a terminal environment. Its core functionality revolves around generating various inline terminal visual effects, supporting features such as Xterm 256/RGB color, complex character movement with easing and bezier curves, and animation via scenes with custom event handling. Users can leverage the library as a Python module or as a standalone command-line application that processes text input and applies selected visual effects like `beams`, `fireworks`, and `matrix`. The project is built using Python and relies on ANSI terminal sequences for cross-platform compatibility, targeting developers and users interested in enhancing terminal output with dynamic visual elements.
