Quelpa is an Emacs Lisp package manager that enables dynamic compilation and installation of Emacs packages directly from source repositories. Targeting Emacs users and Lisp developers in the text editor/IDE domain, it integrates with Emacs' built-in package.el system and supports multiple version control systems including Git, GitHub, Subversion, Mercurial, Bazaar, CVS, Darcs, and Fossil. The tool uses MELPA-compatible recipe formats to fetch source code, build ELPA-compatible packages, and install them locally, solving the problem of managing custom packages, testing development versions, and installing packages not available in standard repositories. It serves Emacs power users, package developers, and system administrators who need flexible package management beyond traditional package repositories like MELPA.
