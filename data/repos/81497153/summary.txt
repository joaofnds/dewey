ExternalDNS is a Kubernetes-native DNS management controller written in Go that automatically synchronizes DNS records across external DNS providers based on Kubernetes resources like Services and Ingresses. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform administrators, it bridges the gap between internal Kubernetes service discovery and external DNS resolution by dynamically configuring DNS records on providers like AWS Route53, Google Cloud DNS, Cloudflare, and Azure DNS. The system monitors the Kubernetes API for changes to exposed services and ingresses, then programmatically updates corresponding DNS entries through provider-specific APIs, eliminating manual DNS management overhead. It supports over 20 DNS providers through both built-in integrations and a webhook system for extensibility, enabling automated DNS orchestration in cloud-native infrastructure deployments.
