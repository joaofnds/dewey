jless is a command-line JSON viewer written in Rust that serves as a specialized replacement for traditional text manipulation tools like less, jq, and cat when working with JSON data. Targeting developers, DevOps engineers, and data professionals who frequently inspect JSON files, APIs responses, and configuration data, it provides syntax highlighting, collapsible object/array structures, vim-inspired navigation keybindings, and regex-based search functionality. The tool addresses the common problem of efficiently reading and exploring large or complex JSON datasets in terminal environments, offering a more ergonomic alternative to piping JSON through multiple command-line utilities or opening files in text editors for data inspection and debugging workflows.
