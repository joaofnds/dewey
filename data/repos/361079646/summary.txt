`jless` is a command-line JSON viewer designed for efficiently reading, exploring, and searching through JSON data. Written in Rust, it provides syntax-highlighted display, object and array expansion/collapsing, and Vim-inspired movement and regex search capabilities. This standalone CLI application streamlines JSON data inspection, offering an alternative to `less`, `jq`, and text editors, targeting developers and system administrators who regularly work with JSON files.
