Nock is a JavaScript library designed for mocking HTTP servers and setting expectations for Node.js applications, primarily for testing purposes. It enables developers to isolate modules that perform HTTP requests by intercepting outgoing requests and providing pre-defined responses. Core functionalities include specifying hostnames, paths, request bodies and query strings for interception, along with methods for defining various reply scenarios, including status codes, headers, and response bodies from files or functions. The library also supports advanced features such as request header matching, request body filtering, response delay simulation, and fixture recording/playback via the `nockBack` utility, providing extensive control for simulating diverse HTTP interactions during testing. This library is primarily a developer productivity tool, specifically a testing library.
