Nock is a Node.js HTTP server mocking and expectations library designed for testing JavaScript applications that make HTTP requests. It works by overriding Node's native `http.request` function and `http.ClientRequest` to intercept outbound HTTP/HTTPS calls during test execution. The library enables developers to mock external API dependencies like REST services, databases (CouchDB), and cloud APIs (Amazon) for isolated unit testing. Key features include request/response matching with support for URL patterns, query parameters, headers, and request bodies using strings, RegExp, or functions. It provides sophisticated testing capabilities including request recording/playback, response delays, request chaining, and comprehensive assertion methods. Nock targets Node.js developers and QA engineers working on microservices, API integrations, and web applications who need reliable, deterministic testing without external service dependencies.
