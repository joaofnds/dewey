`with-emacs.sh` is a Bash utility script designed for Emacs developers and power users to run Emacs instances with alternative configuration directories, bypassing the default `~/.emacs.d` setup. The script addresses the common development workflow problem of testing different Emacs configurations, package development, and troubleshooting by providing isolated environments. It supports both persistent custom configuration directories and temporary sandbox environments that are automatically cleaned up after session termination. Key features include package installation automation, configurable ELPA repository settings, and flexible Emacs executable selection. The tool targets Emacs Lisp developers, configuration maintainers, and system administrators who need to manage multiple Emacs setups without conflicts, particularly useful for package development workflows and configuration testing scenarios.
