hbac.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that automatically manages buffer lifecycle through heuristic-based auto-closing functionality. Designed for software developers using Neovim as their primary code editor, it addresses buffer list pollution by automatically closing unedited buffers when the buffer count exceeds a configurable threshold (default: 10 buffers). The plugin distinguishes between "edited" buffers (entered insert mode or modified) and "unedited" buffers, preserving actively worked files while removing browsed reference files. It integrates with telescope.nvim for visual buffer management and provides manual controls for pinning/unpinning buffers to prevent auto-closure. The plugin targets developers who frequently navigate codebases and need to maintain an organized workspace without manual buffer management overhead, particularly useful during code exploration, debugging, and definition lookups.
