This repository provides official Helm charts for deploying Datadog's monitoring and observability infrastructure components on Kubernetes clusters. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform teams, it enables containerized deployment of core Datadog products including monitoring agents, the Datadog Operator for Kubernetes-native management, Extended DaemonSets for advanced pod scheduling, Observability Pipelines Workers for data processing, Private Action Runners for secure CI/CD workflows, and Synthetics Private Location testing infrastructure. Built using Helm's package management framework and Go templating, these charts solve the complex configuration and deployment challenges of distributed monitoring systems in cloud-native environments. The repository serves as the canonical source for Kubernetes-based Datadog deployments, allowing infrastructure teams to implement comprehensive application performance monitoring, logging, and observability pipelines through declarative YAML configurations and GitOps workflows.
