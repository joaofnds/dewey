This repository provides official Helm charts for deploying Datadog products within Kubernetes environments. The charts facilitate the installation and configuration of Datadog agents, the Datadog operator for managing resources, and other Datadog components such as an extended DaemonSet, observability pipelines worker, a private action runner, and synthetics private locations. Built using Go, the project enables simplified deployment and management of Datadog's observability solutions via Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. These charts are intended for system administrators and DevOps engineers managing Datadog monitoring and observability within their Kubernetes clusters.
