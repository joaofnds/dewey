Phoenix LiveDashboard is a real-time monitoring and debugging tool for Elixir/Phoenix web applications, built on Phoenix LiveView for reactive UI updates. It provides comprehensive system observability including OS metrics (CPU, memory, disk), Erlang VM process inspection, ETS table monitoring, Ecto database statistics, request logging, and telemetry-based performance visualization. The dashboard operates across distributed Erlang nodes, enabling multi-node cluster monitoring from a single interface. Targeted at Phoenix developers and DevOps engineers, it addresses production debugging and performance analysis challenges by exposing deep runtime insights into Elixir applications without external monitoring infrastructure. The tool integrates seamlessly into Phoenix applications through router configuration and supports authentication pipelines for production deployment.
