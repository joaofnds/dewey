`tldr++` is a fast and interactive command-line interface (CLI) client written in Go for accessing and interacting with `tldr-pages`, a community-driven collection of simplified man pages. It provides features such as interactive argument filling, fuzzy command search, and file suggestions for user guidance, differentiating it from other tldr clients. The application is designed for cross-platform compatibility, supporting Linux, macOS, and Windows (with limitations), and leverages libraries including `go-prompt` for interactive elements and `go-git` for built-in Git functionality. This is a standalone developer productivity tool aimed at providing quick access to command usage examples.
