Comic Mono is a programmatically-generated monospace font designed for software development and coding environments. Built using Python and FontForge, it converts the Comic Shanns font into a monospace typeface by adjusting glyph widths and metrics to ensure uniform character spacing essential for code readability. The repository includes a Python script that patches the original font file, generating both regular and bold variants distributed as TTF files. Targeted at developers and programmers who require legible monospace fonts for code editors, terminals, and development environments, it addresses the need for a readable coding font with familiar comic-style aesthetics. The font is distributed via web CDN, npm package, and various Linux package managers for integration into development workflows.
