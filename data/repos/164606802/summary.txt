Comic Mono is a Python-based project that generates a monospace font family optimized for legibility, derived from the Comic Shanns font. It addresses the need for a readable monospaced typeface, particularly for code or text intended for visual clarity. The project features a Python script (`generate.py`) to modify and generate the font files (TTF format), and provides distribution via CDN and npm, targeting web developers and potentially software developers seeking a clear, monospaced font. This is a font library/package.
