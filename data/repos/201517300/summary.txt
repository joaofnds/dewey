This repository provides a Clojure implementation of the docopt description language, a declarative command-line interface specification tool. Targeting DevOps engineers and CLI application developers, it parses docstring-based usage patterns to automatically generate argument parsers for command-line tools. The implementation supports both traditional Clojure projects via tools.deps and modern scripting environments like Babashka, enabling developers to define CLI interfaces through natural language documentation rather than imperative parsing code. Built on the language-agnostic docopt specification, it solves the problem of maintaining separate documentation and argument parsing logic by deriving command-line behavior directly from usage text, making it particularly valuable for system administrators and developers building automation scripts, deployment tools, and CLI utilities in the Clojure ecosystem.
