Perspective-el is an Emacs Lisp package that implements workspace management for Emacs editors, providing multiple named workspaces ("perspectives") similar to virtual desktops in window managers. It targets software developers and power users who work on multiple projects simultaneously within Emacs. Each perspective maintains isolated buffer lists, window layouts, and xref rings, enabling context switching between different codebases without buffer contamination. The package integrates with Emacs' native buffer management system and supports session persistence to disk. Key features include perspective merging for related projects, customizable buffer switching behavior, and compatibility with completing-read frameworks. It addresses the common developer workflow problem of managing multiple concurrent projects in long-running Emacs sessions, particularly beneficial when combined with project management tools like Projectile.
