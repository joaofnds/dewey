`perspective-el` is an Emacs Lisp package providing named workspaces, or "perspectives," within the Emacs environment, allowing users to manage multiple, isolated buffer lists and window layouts for different projects or tasks. Key functionalities include saving and restoring Emacs sessions with distinct perspectives, buffer switching within a perspective, and merging perspectives for collaborative work. This developer productivity tool relies on Emacs Lisp and integrates with Emacs's buffer management system and key packages like `Projectile`, and it supports custom buffer switchers via wrappers. It is a plugin/extension designed to enhance Emacs's user experience.
