Blueprint is a React-based UI component library built with TypeScript and Sass, specifically designed for developing complex, data-dense desktop web applications. It provides a comprehensive toolkit of pre-built components including tables, date/time pickers, select controls, and icons, organized as a monorepo using Lerna for package management. The library targets frontend developers building enterprise-grade web interfaces that prioritize desktop functionality over mobile-first design. Blueprint solves the problem of creating consistent, scalable user interfaces for data-heavy applications by offering specialized components like interactive spreadsheet-style tables and advanced selection controls. The modular package structure allows developers to selectively import components, while the included build tooling, ESLint configurations, and documentation theme provide a complete development ecosystem for React-based enterprise applications.
