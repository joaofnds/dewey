Rome is a unified developer toolchain for web development, written in Rust, that consolidates JavaScript and TypeScript code formatting, linting, bundling, and related build processes into a single tool. It targets frontend and full-stack web developers who traditionally rely on separate tools like ESLint, Prettier, Babel, and webpack for code quality and build automation. The project emphasizes performance through Rust implementation, minimal configuration with strong conventions, and comprehensive language support including JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, HTML, Markdown, and CSS. Rome provides IDE integration with sophisticated parsing capabilities and aims to replace the fragmented JavaScript tooling ecosystem with a cohesive, high-performance alternative that handles syntax analysis, code transformation, and development workflow optimization in one integrated solution.
