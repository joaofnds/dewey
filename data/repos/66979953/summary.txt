The Rust Language Server (RLS) was a deprecated language server implementation that provided IDE functionality for Rust development environments through the Language Server Protocol (LSP). Built in Rust, it offered core development features including goto definition, symbol search, code completion, refactoring, and real-time error checking by integrating with the Rust compiler and Racer for source code analysis. The RLS served as backend infrastructure for IDE extensions, particularly targeting Visual Studio Code through a reference implementation, enabling rich development experiences for Rust programmers. It addressed the challenge of providing intelligent code assistance and navigation in Rust projects by leveraging compiler data for precise analysis and falling back to heuristic-based tools for performance-critical operations like autocompletion, though it has since been superseded by rust-analyzer.
