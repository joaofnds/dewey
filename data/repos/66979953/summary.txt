The `rls` repository provides the Rust Language Server (RLS), a background process designed to enhance IDEs and editors by offering intelligent code assistance for Rust programs. Functionality includes features like "go to definition", symbol search, code completion, refactoring, and error diagnostics, powered by data from the Rust compiler and Racer. Built in Rust, the RLS implements the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and serves as a frontend-independent project type, aiming to improve the developer experience with the Rust programming language by providing advanced tooling within various code editors. This is a developer productivity tool.
