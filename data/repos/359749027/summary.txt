`clj-github` is a Clojure library designed to interact with the GitHub REST API, providing functionalities for programmatically managing GitHub resources. It offers a client for making HTTP requests to the GitHub API, supporting authentication via GitHub Apps (using app ID and private key) and token-based authentication, along with a mechanism for token caching and refresh. Key features include utilities for managing repositories and making commits through the `clj-github.changeset` namespace, enabling file content modifications and branch updates. The library further facilitates testing through the `clj-github.test-helpers` namespace, which provides a macro to mock API calls using `http-kit-fake`. This is a developer productivity library, specifically a Clojure library intended for developers working on Clojure-based projects that need to interact with the GitHub API.
