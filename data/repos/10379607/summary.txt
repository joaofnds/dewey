GoReplay is a network monitoring tool written in Go that captures live HTTP traffic by listening on network interfaces and replays it to test environments for continuous testing with production data. Targeting DevOps engineers and QA teams in web development, it operates as a passive traffic interceptor rather than a proxy, requiring minimal infrastructure changes. The tool addresses the challenge of realistic load testing and system validation by enabling traffic shadowing, allowing teams to test code deployments, configuration changes, and infrastructure modifications against real user behavior patterns. It supports various input/output methods including raw network capture, HTTP replay, and file-based traffic storage, making it suitable for organizations needing production-like testing scenarios without affecting live systems.
