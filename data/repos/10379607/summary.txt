GoReplay is an open-source network monitoring tool written in Go, designed for capturing and replaying live HTTP traffic into a test environment. It facilitates continuous testing by enabling the reuse of existing traffic for tasks such as shadowing, load testing, and detailed analysis, enhancing confidence in code deployments and infrastructure changes. Key functionalities include passively recording network traffic without affecting production infrastructure, with replay capabilities to staging environments or stdout.  This standalone application, leveraging the Go programming language, targets DevOps and QA engineers seeking to improve their testing and deployment workflows.
