CIDER is an Emacs-based interactive development environment for Clojure and ClojureScript programming, implemented in Emacs Lisp. It provides a comprehensive IDE experience by extending Emacs with features like REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) integration, code completion, debugging, documentation lookup, test execution, and interactive programming capabilities. The tool connects to nREPL servers to enable live code evaluation and development workflow enhancement for functional programming projects. CIDER complements existing Clojure editing modes by adding runtime interaction and project management features, targeting Clojure developers who prefer Emacs as their primary editor. It supports multiple project build tools including Leiningen and tools.deps, serving the functional programming and JVM ecosystem development community with sophisticated tooling for interactive development workflows.
