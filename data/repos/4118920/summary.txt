CIDER is an Emacs extension, a developer productivity tool, providing an interactive development environment (IDE) for Clojure and ClojureScript development. It extends Emacs with `cider-mode`, complementing `clojure-mode` and `clojure-ts-mode`, enabling interactive programming features like code completion, debugging, definition lookup, and test running, all interacting with a running Clojure process via nREPL. The project leverages Emacs Lisp and targets Clojure developers, enhancing the Clojure development workflow within the Emacs text editor.
