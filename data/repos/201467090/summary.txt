Babashka is a native, fast-starting Clojure interpreter designed for scripting and command-line automation, intended to replace Bash scripts in many use cases. It leverages the Clojure language, utilizing GraalVM for native compilation and fast startup times, enabling cross-platform execution on Linux, macOS, and Windows without requiring a JVM. Key functionalities include interop with common Java classes, multi-threading support, and built-in namespaces providing utilities like tools.cli and cheshire. This is a standalone CLI application targeting developers familiar with Clojure, offering an alternative for tasks where Bash is used but Clojure's expressiveness is desired.
