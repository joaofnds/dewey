Babashka is a native Clojure interpreter built with GraalVM for shell scripting and automation tasks, targeting the DevOps and system administration domain. It compiles to a fast-starting native binary that eliminates JVM startup overhead, making Clojure viable for command-line scripts, build automation, and system utilities where Bash would traditionally be used. The interpreter implements a substantial subset of Clojure core functionality through SCI (Small Clojure Interpreter), includes batteries-like tools.cli and cheshire for JSON processing, and provides Java interop for common classes like System, File, and java.time. It serves developers and system administrators who want to leverage Clojure's expressiveness for scripting tasks that are too complex for Bash but too simple to justify full JVM Clojure applications, offering cross-platform compatibility across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
