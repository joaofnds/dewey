`terraform-mode.el` is an Emacs major mode providing syntax highlighting, indentation, imenu integration, and formatting capabilities specifically for Terraform configuration files. It leverages `hcl-mode` for underlying syntax features and integrates with the `terraform fmt` command for code formatting. Additional features include block folding using `outline-mode`, and access to Terraform resource documentation directly within the editor using context-aware keybindings. This Emacs Lisp project functions as a plugin/extension, enhancing the development workflow for users managing infrastructure-as-code with Terraform.
