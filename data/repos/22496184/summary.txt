terraform-mode.el is an Emacs Lisp major mode specifically designed for editing Terraform infrastructure-as-code configuration files in the Emacs text editor. Targeting DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers, and infrastructure developers, it provides essential IDE-like features including syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, code formatting via `terraform fmt`, block folding through outline-mode integration, and imenu support for navigation. The mode inherits from hcl-mode for HashiCorp Configuration Language parsing and adds Terraform-specific functionality such as direct access to provider documentation through integrated browser links and clipboard operations. It addresses the need for enhanced developer experience when writing and maintaining Terraform infrastructure definitions, supporting customizable indentation levels and format-on-save capabilities for streamlined cloud infrastructure management workflows.
