http-kit is a Ring-compatible HTTP client and server library for Clojure web development, implementing an event-driven architecture for high-concurrency applications. Built in Java with zero dependencies, it provides both synchronous and asynchronous APIs for HTTP operations and WebSocket connections, serving as a drop-in replacement for standard Ring Jetty adapters. The library targets Clojure web developers building scalable web applications, real-time systems, and microservices that require efficient connection handling and low memory overhead. It addresses the need for lightweight, high-performance HTTP infrastructure in the JVM ecosystem, supporting HTTP long-polling, streaming, and WebSocket protocols while maintaining compatibility with existing Ring middleware and tooling.
