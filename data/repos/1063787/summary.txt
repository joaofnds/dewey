Speclj is a testing and behavior-driven development (TDD/BDD) framework for Clojure and ClojureScript, inspired by RSpec. It enables developers to write specifications for their Clojure and ClojureScript projects, offering features like assertions, test organization with `describe` and `it` blocks, and support for Clojure CLR and Babashka. This library provides a command-line interface and integrates with Leiningen, `deps.edn`, and Cloverage for code coverage, serving as a developer productivity tool focused on testing. Speclj is designed to facilitate writing and running tests within Clojure and ClojureScript development workflows.
