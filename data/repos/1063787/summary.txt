Speclj is a Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework for Clojure and ClojureScript applications, inspired by Ruby's RSpec framework. It provides a comprehensive testing DSL with familiar constructs like `describe`, `it`, `should`, and `should-not` assertions, along with setup/teardown components such as `before`, `with`, and `around`. The framework targets Clojure developers building applications on the JVM, browser environments via ClojureScript, or .NET via Clojure CLR, offering integration with popular build tools including Leiningen and deps.edn. Speclj solves the challenge of writing expressive, readable unit and integration tests in functional Clojure codebases by providing an idiomatic testing syntax that follows BDD conventions, enabling developers to write specifications that serve as both executable tests and living documentation of system behavior.
