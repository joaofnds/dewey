Colly is a high-performance web scraping and crawling framework written in Go, designed for developers building data extraction applications. It provides a clean API for creating web scrapers, spiders, and crawlers with features like concurrent request handling (>1k requests/sec), automatic cookie/session management, robots.txt compliance, and distributed scraping capabilities. The framework targets data engineers, backend developers, and data scientists working in data mining, web archiving, and automated data collection workflows. Colly abstracts HTTP client complexity while offering granular control over scraping behavior through callbacks, request/response middleware, and configurable rate limiting. It serves applications ranging from price monitoring and content aggregation to SEO analysis and competitive intelligence gathering, providing a robust alternative to Python-based scraping tools in Go-centric technology stacks.
