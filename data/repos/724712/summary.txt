The `rust-lang/rust` repository is the core source code repository for the Rust programming language, focused on enabling reliable and efficient software development. It encompasses the Rust compiler, standard library, and related documentation. Key features include memory safety through ownership, performance optimization, and comprehensive tooling like a package manager (Cargo), a formatter (rustfmt), and a linter (Clippy). This is a foundational project, functioning primarily as a compiler and associated development tools for the Rust language, targeting system and application developers who require high performance and reliability.
