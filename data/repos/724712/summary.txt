This repository contains the complete implementation of the Rust programming language, including the rustc compiler, standard library, and core runtime components. Rust is a systems programming language targeting performance-critical domains such as operating systems, embedded systems, web backends, blockchain infrastructure, and system utilities. The compiler implements advanced memory safety guarantees through ownership semantics, zero-cost abstractions, and compile-time borrow checking, eliminating common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and data races without garbage collection overhead. The codebase integrates with LLVM for code generation and includes the foundation for Rust's ecosystem toolchain including Cargo package manager integration. Primary users are systems programmers, infrastructure engineers, and application developers requiring both memory safety and native performance for concurrent, low-level software development across web services, cryptocurrency, game engines, and embedded device programming.
