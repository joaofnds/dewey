`vim-speeddating` is a Vim plugin that enables users to increment and decrement dates, times, and potentially other numerical or date-related values directly within the Vim editor. Utilizing `CTRL-A` and `CTRL-X` bindings, it enhances developer productivity by streamlining the manipulation of such values in text files. Developed in Vim Script, the plugin functions as an extension to the Vim editor, augmenting its core text editing capabilities. This project is designed for Vim users seeking to improve their workflow when working with date, time, and numerical data within text documents.
