vim-speeddating is a Vim Script plugin that extends Vim's native CTRL-A/CTRL-X increment/decrement functionality to intelligently handle temporal data types including dates, times, and datetime formats. The plugin addresses the limitation where Vim's default numeric incrementing treats date separators like hyphens as negative signs, leading to incorrect calculations when working with ISO dates, RFC timestamps, and other structured temporal formats. It supports multiple date formats, roman numerals, ordinals, and provides visual mode capabilities for batch operations and sequence generation. Target users include software developers, system administrators, and technical writers who frequently manipulate timestamps, log files, configuration files, or documentation containing temporal data within the Vim text editor environment.
