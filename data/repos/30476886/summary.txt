VMD is a Node.js-based desktop markdown preview application built on Electron that provides GitHub-style rendering for markdown files. Targeting web developers, technical writers, and documentation authors, it solves the problem of real-time markdown preview during content creation by offering live file watching, drag-and-drop functionality, and stdin piping capabilities. The tool renders markdown with GitHub-compatible styling, supports syntax highlighting themes, emoji rendering, checklists, and front matter parsing for Jekyll/Hugo workflows. Key features include customizable CSS styling, window state persistence, navigation between linked documents, and clipboard integration. VMD serves the technical documentation and web development domain by bridging the gap between markdown editing in text editors and final rendered output visualization.
