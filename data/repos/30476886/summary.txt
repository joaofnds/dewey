`vmd` is a standalone JavaScript command-line application (CLI) that previews Markdown files in a separate window, styled to resemble GitHub's rendering. Key features include file watching for automatic updates, standard input support for piping Markdown text from other programs, drag-and-drop file loading, navigation within the document, clipboard integration, and emoji/checklist rendering. It leverages JavaScript and Electron for its GUI, with options for custom themes, syntax highlighting, and frontmatter support for Jekyll and Hugo content. Its target audience is developers and writers who need a local, GitHub-style Markdown previewer.
