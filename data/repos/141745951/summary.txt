`ndb` is a standalone developer productivity tool providing an enhanced debugging experience for Node.js applications. Built upon Chrome DevTools, it enables breakpoint debugging, async stack tracing, and file editing within the UI, with capabilities to blackbox external scripts and attach to child processes. Users can debug Node.js applications directly through `ndb` or prepend it to existing commands like `npm run` scripts, benefiting from features like eager evaluation and profiling. The project utilizes JavaScript and depends on Puppeteer, leveraging Chromium's debugging capabilities to streamline the Node.js development workflow.
