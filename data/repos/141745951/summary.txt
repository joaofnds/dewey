ndb is a Node.js debugging tool that provides an enhanced debugging experience by integrating Chrome DevTools with Node.js applications. Targeting web developers and Node.js engineers, it leverages Puppeteer to launch a Chromium instance that serves as the debugging interface, replacing traditional command-line debugging workflows. The tool addresses key limitations in Node.js debugging by automatically detecting and attaching to child processes, enabling breakpoint placement before module loading, supporting in-editor file modifications with disk persistence, and providing intelligent code blackboxing to filter out node_modules and internal libraries. It supports advanced DevTools features including async stack traces, memory profiling, JS sampling, and console evaluation, while offering flexible execution modes through direct binary replacement, npm script integration, or standalone application launch for comprehensive Node.js application debugging.
