Kubernetes is an open-source, production-grade system designed for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing orchestration for deployment, scaling, and maintenance. Built on Google's Borg experience and hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), it allows users to deploy and manage containerized applications. Developed primarily in Go, Kubernetes functions as a standalone application, central to the domain of cloud-native computing and container orchestration, and targets system administrators and developers building and deploying containerized applications.
