Kubernetes is a production-grade container orchestration platform written in Go that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across distributed computing clusters. Targeting the DevOps and cloud infrastructure domain, it serves as the foundation for modern microservices architectures by providing container scheduling, service discovery, load balancing, health monitoring, and resource management capabilities. Built upon Google's internal Borg system experience and hosted by the CNCF, Kubernetes solves the complex problem of managing containerized workloads at scale across multiple hosts. The platform primarily serves system administrators, DevOps engineers, and platform engineers who need to orchestrate containerized applications in production environments, offering declarative configuration management and automated operational tasks for container lifecycle management.
