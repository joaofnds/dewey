`libzmq` is a C++ library implementing the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) messaging kernel, designed to extend standard socket interfaces with advanced features found in messaging middleware. It provides an abstraction for asynchronous message queues, various messaging patterns (pub-sub, push-pull), and message filtering, enabling seamless access to multiple transport protocols. This library serves as a core component for building distributed, concurrent, and networked applications, acting as a networking foundation for projects requiring efficient message passing, with a focus on performance and scalability. It is a library, leveraging C++98 with optional C++11 features, and is supported on a variety of operating systems and architectures.
