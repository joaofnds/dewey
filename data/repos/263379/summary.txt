ZeroMQ (libzmq) is a high-performance C++ messaging library that implements the ZMTP/3.1 protocol for distributed and concurrent systems. It provides a lightweight messaging kernel that extends standard socket interfaces with asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns (pub/sub, push/pull, request/reply), and transport protocol abstraction. The library targets systems programmers and distributed application developers building network services, microservices architectures, and real-time communication systems across various platforms including Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android. Written in C++98 with optional C++11 features, it uses autotools or CMake for configuration and focuses on zero-copy messaging, lock-free algorithms, and minimal latency for high-throughput networking applications requiring reliable message passing between distributed components.
