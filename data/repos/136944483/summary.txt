doom-modeline is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a customizable, minimalist status bar (mode-line) for the Emacs text editor, targeting software developers and power users who work extensively in Emacs environments. The package integrates with numerous development tools and frameworks including LSP servers (lsp-mode, eglot), version control systems, project management tools (projectile, project.el), syntax checkers (flycheck, flymake), and modal editing systems (evil, god-mode). It displays contextual information such as programming language versions, Git status, compilation errors, search matches, macro recording state, battery status, and integration indicators for email clients, IRC, and cloud services like Kubernetes. The modeline addresses the need for a visually appealing, information-dense status bar that consolidates development workflow indicators into a single, performance-optimized interface for Emacs-based development environments.
