cl-mongo is a Common Lisp client library that provides programmatic access to MongoDB databases, targeting Lisp developers working in data-intensive applications and backend systems. The library implements core MongoDB operations including document insertion, querying, updating, deletion, indexing, and regex-based searching, while supporting JavaScript execution for map-reduce operations through Lisp-to-JavaScript compilation. Built primarily for SBCL and Clozure Common Lisp with cross-platform compatibility, it features multi-threaded query processing, declarative syntax macros ($.. operators), and comprehensive CRUD functionality. The library addresses the need for native MongoDB integration in Common Lisp applications, enabling developers to leverage MongoDB's document-oriented, schema-free database capabilities within Lisp-based data processing, web applications, and analytical systems without requiring external drivers or complex interop layers.
