`cl-mongo` is a Common Lisp library providing an interface to MongoDB document databases, enabling functionalities such as inserting, updating, and deleting documents, along with indexing and searching using regular expressions. It supports features including JavaScript execution within the Lisp REPL via a compiler and multi-threading for query processing.  The library is designed to be used with SBCL and Clozure Common Lisp, with broader compatibility across other Common Lisp implementations like CLisp and Allegro Common Lisp.  It is primarily a library and provides testing via an ASDF-installable package that interfaces with a local MongoDB instance.
