Redis OM for Node.js is a TypeScript-based object-relational mapping (ORM) library that provides an abstraction layer for Redis database operations in Node.js applications. Targeting backend web developers and full-stack engineers, it eliminates the need for low-level Redis commands by mapping Redis data structures (JSON documents and Hashes) to JavaScript objects with a fluent query interface. The library integrates with Node Redis client and supports Redis Stack features including RediSearch for full-text search, geospatial queries, and complex filtering operations. It addresses the common problem of manual Redis data serialization and query construction by providing schema definition, repository patterns, automatic indexing, and type-safe database interactions for developers building scalable web applications with Redis as their primary or caching data store.
