Istio is an open-source service mesh platform written in Go that provides infrastructure layer capabilities for microservices architectures. Built on Envoy proxy, it operates primarily in Kubernetes environments to handle service-to-service communication, traffic management, security policies, and observability without requiring application code changes. The platform consists of Istiod (control plane with Pilot for proxy configuration, Citadel for certificate management, and Galley for configuration validation) and Envoy sidecars for data plane operations. Istio addresses complex distributed system challenges including load balancing, circuit breaking, fault injection, mTLS authentication, and telemetry collection. It targets DevOps engineers, platform architects, and SREs managing containerized microservices who need to implement consistent networking, security, and monitoring policies across service meshes in cloud-native environments.
