Istio is a service mesh platform, written in Go, designed to connect, secure, control, and observe microservices within a distributed application architecture, particularly in Kubernetes environments. It provides functionalities including traffic management (load balancing, routing), service-to-service authentication, policy enforcement, circuit breaking, fault injection, and telemetry collection. The project comprises core components like Envoy proxies (for ingress/egress traffic handling) and Istiod (the control plane for service discovery, configuration, and certificate management). Istio is a standalone platform, primarily targeted toward DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers building or managing cloud-native applications with microservice architectures.
