osquery is a cross-platform system instrumentation framework written in C++ that exposes operating system data through a SQL interface for security monitoring and system administration. Targeting the cybersecurity and DevOps domains, it transforms OS components like processes, network connections, file systems, and kernel modules into queryable SQL tables, enabling administrators and security engineers to perform real-time system analysis using familiar SQL syntax. The framework supports Linux, macOS, and Windows environments and provides both interactive querying through osqueryi shell and automated monitoring via osqueryd daemon with scheduler capabilities. Primary use cases include intrusion detection, compliance monitoring, incident response, and infrastructure analytics, serving system administrators, security analysts, and DevOps engineers who need programmatic access to system state information for monitoring, auditing, and threat hunting activities.
