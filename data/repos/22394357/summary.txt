osquery is a C++-based framework enabling operating system instrumentation, monitoring, and security analytics. It exposes OS data as a high-performance SQL database, allowing users to query system information, such as running processes, network connections, and file hashes, using SQL. This project provides a CLI tool and a scheduler for ad-hoc querying and continuous monitoring across multiple hosts, functioning as a system monitoring and intrusion detection tool for system administrators and security professionals.
