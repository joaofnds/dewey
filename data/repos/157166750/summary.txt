Lens is a Kubernetes IDE and management platform designed for DevOps engineers and developers working with containerized applications in cloud-native environments. It provides a unified graphical user interface for managing, monitoring, and troubleshooting Kubernetes clusters and workloads, eliminating the need for complex kubectl command-line operations. The platform serves as a centralized tool for Kubernetes cluster administration, offering context-aware visualization of pods, services, deployments, and other Kubernetes resources. Previously open-source, Lens is now a commercial product by Mirantis that extends functionality through a plugin-based extension API, targeting teams managing container orchestration workflows and seeking to streamline Kubernetes operations through an intuitive desktop application interface.
