Mermaid Live Editor is a TypeScript-based web application built with SvelteKit that provides an interactive browser-based environment for creating, editing, and sharing Mermaid diagrams. It serves the technical documentation and software development domain by offering real-time preview capabilities for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and Gantt charts using Mermaid's text-to-diagram syntax. The application integrates with external rendering services (mermaid.ink, Kroki) for SVG/PNG export functionality and supports collaborative workflows through shareable diagram links. Deployed via Netlify with Docker containerization support, it targets developers, technical writers, and software architects who need to create visual documentation and system diagrams as part of their development workflow, eliminating the need for traditional diagramming software by leveraging code-based diagram generation.
