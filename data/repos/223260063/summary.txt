The `mermaid-live-editor` is a web application for creating, previewing, and sharing Mermaid diagrams and charts, operating within the domain of data visualization and diagramming tools. It allows users to edit various diagram types (flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts) in real-time, save them as SVG images, and generate shareable links for collaborative viewing and editing. Built using TypeScript and leveraging SvelteKit for its front-end, the project provides Docker support for deployment and development workflows, with Netlify managing automated builds and deployments. This is a standalone web application designed for developers and users seeking to create and share Mermaid diagrams easily.
