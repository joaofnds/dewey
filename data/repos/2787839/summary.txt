Lsyncd is a standalone application, a live syncing daemon, designed for synchronizing local directories with remote targets, primarily using rsync. It monitors local directory tree events (inotify or fsevents) and synchronizes changes to a remote location. Configurable via a Lua configuration file, it supports custom action configurations, including shell scripts and Lua code, providing flexibility. The project's core technology stack relies on Lua scripting for configuration, with rsync as the default synchronization tool and optional SSH integration, addressing system administrators and developers needing local-to-remote directory mirroring.
