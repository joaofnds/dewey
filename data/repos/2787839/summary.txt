Lsyncd is a file synchronization daemon designed for system administrators and DevOps teams managing live directory mirroring between local and remote systems. Built with a C core and Lua scripting interface, it leverages filesystem event monitoring (inotify/fsevents) to detect changes in local directory trees and automatically triggers rsync processes to synchronize modifications to remote targets. The tool aggregates filesystem events over short intervals to optimize transfer efficiency and supports advanced configurations including rsync+ssh for intelligent file movement operations. Primarily used in infrastructure management, backup automation, and deployment pipelines, Lsyncd addresses the need for real-time, one-way directory synchronization without requiring specialized filesystems or block devices, making it particularly valuable for maintaining live mirrors from secure to less-secure environments.
