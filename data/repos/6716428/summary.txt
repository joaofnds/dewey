Robe is an Emacs Lisp package that provides intelligent code assistance for Ruby development within the Emacs editor. It establishes a Ruby REPL subprocess that loads application or gem code to enable advanced IDE-like features including method definition navigation, documentation lookup, code completion, and context-aware ElDoc integration. The tool leverages Pry REPL integration and works with both traditional ruby-mode and ruby-ts-mode, supporting Ruby 2.3-3.4 across various platforms. Robe targets Ruby developers working in web development, particularly Rails applications, who prefer Emacs as their primary development environment. It integrates with company-mode for enhanced autocompletion and supports complex Ruby introspection by analyzing buffer context, method inheritance hierarchies, and module structures to provide accurate code intelligence and navigation capabilities.
