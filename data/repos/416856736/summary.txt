The add-to-calendar-button repository provides a JavaScript Web Component library for generating cross-platform calendar integration buttons on web applications. Built for web developers working across vanilla JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue, and Svelte frameworks, it solves the complex problem of reliably creating "Add to Calendar" functionality that works across Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, Microsoft 365/Outlook/Teams, Yahoo Calendar, and generic iCal systems. The component handles timezone management, recurring events, multi-date events, and generates appropriate calendar-specific URLs or downloadable .ics files while managing edge cases like WebView environments and mobile browsers. It includes accessibility compliance (W3C WAI), internationalization support for 20+ languages, responsive UI with light/dark themes, and generates Schema.org structured data for SEO optimization, targeting frontend developers who need robust calendar integration without backend dependencies.
