`lsofgraph` is a Lua-based command-line utility designed to visualize interprocess communication using output from the Unix `lsof` command. It parses `lsof`'s output and transforms it into a format compatible with the Graphviz graph description language, enabling users to generate visual representations of FIFO and UNIX process interactions. The core functionality lies in its role as a data transformation tool within a pipeline, and its output is designed for consumption by the `dot` utility for graph rendering. This is a standalone command-line application that provides system administrators and developers a way to graphically understand process relationships.
