**lsofgraph** is a Unix system administration utility written in Lua that converts `lsof` (list open files) command output into Graphviz-compatible visualizations for analyzing interprocess communication patterns. The tool specifically focuses on mapping FIFO pipes and UNIX domain socket connections between processes, transforming raw lsof data into directed graphs that reveal system-level IPC relationships. It operates as a command-line filter in Unix pipelines, processing lsof's machine-readable format (-F flag) and generating DOT graph descriptions for rendering with Graphviz tools like `dot` and `unflatten`. This utility primarily serves system administrators, DevOps engineers, and system developers who need to visualize and debug complex process communication topologies, understand system dependencies, or analyze interprocess data flows in Unix-like environments for troubleshooting and system optimization purposes.
