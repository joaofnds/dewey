TigerBeetle is a specialized financial transactions database built in Zig, designed for high-performance OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) workloads in mission-critical financial systems. The database implements double-entry bookkeeping primitives with debit/credit account management, providing ACID guarantees for financial transactions through a custom storage engine and consensus protocol. It targets financial technology developers, payment processors, and banking infrastructure teams who require strict consistency, high throughput, and safety guarantees for monetary operations. The system supports clustered deployments with replica management and offers a REPL interface for account creation, transfer execution, and balance queries, positioning itself as a purpose-built alternative to general-purpose databases for financial transaction processing workloads.
