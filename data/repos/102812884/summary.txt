`Primalize` is a Ruby library designed for serializing Ruby objects into primitive data types, primarily for JSON output. It allows developers to define "primalizers" using a declarative syntax, specifying attribute types and supporting coercion and virtual attribute generation for data transformation. The library facilitates type checking and provides customizable error handling for type mismatches during serialization. As a library, it integrates within Ruby applications, providing developers with tools to manage and format data for external representations such as APIs, and targets Ruby developers needing serialization capabilities.
