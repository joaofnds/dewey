Woo is a high-performance HTTP server implementation written in Common Lisp, built on top of the libev event loop library for non-blocking I/O operations. Targeting web developers in the Lisp ecosystem, it serves as a production-ready web server that integrates with the Clack web application framework and implements the Lack application interface specification. The server supports SSL/TLS encryption, multi-worker clustering for horizontal scaling, graceful signal handling, and aims to deliver maximum throughput for Common Lisp web applications. Woo addresses the need for a fast, scalable HTTP server within the Lisp web development stack, competing with servers written in other languages while maintaining compatibility with existing Lisp web frameworks and middleware systems.
