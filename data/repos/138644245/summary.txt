v8n is a JavaScript validation library designed for web developers to perform client-side and server-side data validation using a fluent, chainable API. Built in vanilla JavaScript, it provides comprehensive validation capabilities for primitives, arrays, objects, and complex data structures through method chaining syntax. The library supports synchronous boolean-based validation, exception-based validation with detailed error reporting, and asynchronous validation for time-consuming operations like backend checks. It features built-in validation rules (string length, numeric ranges, array operations) with extensibility for custom validators, schema validation for object structures, and reusable validation modules. Targeting JavaScript developers working on form validation, API input sanitization, and data integrity checks in web applications, v8n addresses the need for readable, maintainable validation logic without external dependencies while maintaining a small bundle size for production deployments.
