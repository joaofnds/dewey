This repository contains the legacy source code for Processing, a Java-based visual programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) designed for creative coding and computational arts. Processing targets artists, designers, educators, and creative technologists who need to create interactive graphics, animations, and multimedia applications without extensive programming expertise. The platform provides a simplified Java syntax, built-in graphics rendering capabilities, and extensive libraries for computer vision, sound processing, and hardware interfacing. Processing serves the creative technology domain by bridging the gap between programming and visual arts, enabling rapid prototyping of interactive installations, generative art, data visualizations, and educational programming projects. Development has migrated to the processing4 repository, making this a historical archive of the Processing 3.x codebase that shaped creative programming education and digital art creation workflows.
