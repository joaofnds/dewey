This repository contains the source code for the Processing Development Environment (PDE), a Java-based platform for visual arts, design, and education. Processing facilitates creative coding through a simplified programming language and integrated development environment, enabling users to generate interactive graphics, animations, and visualizations. As a standalone application, the PDE provides a code editor, compiler, and runtime environment, offering a direct way to learn and experiment with programming concepts relevant to visual arts and design, and related projects. Development has moved to a new repository, `processing/processing4`, for ongoing bug fixes and feature development.
