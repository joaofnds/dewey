`memviz` is a Go library designed for visualizing Go data structures using Graphviz. It takes a pointer to any Go data structure and generates Graphviz's dot file format, enabling the creation of visual diagrams. The library's core functionality revolves around providing a more intuitive way to debug data structures compared to raw text representations, utilizing graph-based visualizations. It relies on the Go programming language and integrates with the Graphviz graph visualization software, positioning it as a developer productivity tool for Go programmers.
