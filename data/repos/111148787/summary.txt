memviz is a Go library that generates visual representations of in-memory data structures by leveraging reflection to traverse object graphs and output Graphviz DOT format files. Targeting Go developers working in software development and debugging domains, it addresses the challenge of understanding complex pointer relationships, nested structures, and memory layouts that are difficult to comprehend through traditional text-based debugging output. The library uses Go's reflection capabilities to introspect arbitrary data structures at runtime, then generates graph descriptions compatible with Graphviz for rendering as visual diagrams. This tool is particularly valuable for Go developers debugging recursive data structures, linked lists, trees, and other complex pointer-based architectures where visual representation significantly improves comprehension over traditional pretty-printing or textual output methods.
