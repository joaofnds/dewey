sidekiq-scheduler is a Ruby gem that extends Sidekiq, a popular background job processing framework, with cron-like scheduling capabilities for web applications. Targeted at Ruby/Rails developers and DevOps engineers, it enables automated job scheduling using cron expressions to trigger recurring tasks such as data cleanup, report generation, and maintenance operations. The library integrates with existing Sidekiq infrastructure, utilizing fugit for cron parsing and rufus-scheduler for timing mechanisms, while supporting dynamic schedule updates, queue management, and metadata injection. It addresses the common web development need for reliable, periodic background task execution without requiring external cron services, making it particularly valuable for Ruby web applications requiring automated recurring processes like database maintenance, email campaigns, or data synchronization tasks.
