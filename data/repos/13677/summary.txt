Compojure is a concise HTTP routing library for Clojure web development built on top of the Ring HTTP abstraction layer. It enables developers to compose web applications from small, independent route handlers using a declarative DSL that maps HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and URL patterns to handler functions. The library provides macros like `defroutes` and route matching functions that integrate seamlessly with Ring's request/response model, allowing developers to build RESTful web services and applications in idiomatic Clojure. Compojure targets Clojure web developers who need lightweight, functional routing capabilities without the overhead of larger web frameworks, making it particularly suitable for microservices, APIs, and small-to-medium web applications in the JVM ecosystem.
