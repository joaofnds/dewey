Compojure is a Clojure library providing concise routing capabilities for web applications built with the Ring framework. It facilitates the creation of Ring handlers from modular, independent components, enabling the definition of routes and associated request handling logic. The library's core functionality includes HTTP routing, with features like route definition using macros and a mechanism for handling "not found" responses. This library is a developer productivity tool, specifically aimed at Clojure developers building web applications and services that leverage the Ring specification.
