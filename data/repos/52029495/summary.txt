This repository provides Docker container images for Debezium, a distributed platform that transforms databases into event streams. These images are automatically built and published on Quay.io. Debezium utilizes Kafka Connect connectors to capture row-level changes from databases, recording data history in Kafka logs. This project serves as a set of containerized deployment artifacts enabling the use of Debezium, which operates within the data streaming and database integration domain.
