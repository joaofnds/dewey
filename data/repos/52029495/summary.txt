This repository provides Docker container images for Debezium, a distributed change data capture (CDC) platform that transforms database changes into real-time event streams. Built on Apache Kafka and providing Kafka Connect compatible connectors, Debezium monitors database management systems and captures row-level changes, publishing them to Kafka topics for downstream consumption. The containerized deployment targets data engineers, system administrators, and backend developers implementing event-driven architectures, real-time data pipelines, and microservices synchronization. The images are automatically built using Shell scripts and published to Quay.io, enabling straightforward deployment of CDC infrastructure for organizations needing to stream database changes to applications, analytics systems, or data lakes without custom database polling or complex integration code.
