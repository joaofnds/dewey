The Front-End Checklist is a comprehensive quality assurance framework for web developers, providing systematized pre-production validation checklists for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript websites. This documentation-based resource addresses frontend development quality control by organizing essential checks across HTML head elements, semantic markup, web fonts, CSS optimization, JavaScript best practices, and accessibility compliance. The checklist employs a three-tier priority system (low/medium/high) to categorize validation items based on their impact on SEO, performance, and functionality. Targeting frontend developers and web development teams, it serves as a systematic audit tool to ensure production-ready websites meet modern web standards, accessibility requirements, and performance benchmarks before deployment, reducing post-launch issues and improving overall code quality.
