This repository provides a completion framework for Emacs text editor consisting of three integrated tools: Ivy (generic completion mechanism), Counsel (Ivy-enhanced versions of common Emacs commands), and Swiper (Ivy-based search interface). Written entirely in Emacs Lisp, it targets software developers and power users who work extensively within the Emacs ecosystem. The framework replaces Emacs' default completion systems like icomplete-mode and isearch with more efficient, customizable alternatives that provide real-time filtering and overview capabilities. It addresses the core problem of inefficient navigation and completion workflows in Emacs by offering enhanced file finding, buffer switching, command execution, and in-buffer searching functionalities through a unified minibuffer-based interface that integrates seamlessly with existing Emacs workflows.
