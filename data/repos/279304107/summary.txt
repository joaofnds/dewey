The prathyvsh/pl-catalog repository is a curated technical catalog documenting experimental and indie programming languages across diverse computational domains. It serves as a comprehensive reference for programming language enthusiasts, compiler researchers, and developers exploring alternative language paradigms including functional programming (Coalton, Felix), theorem proving (Arend, Dafny), WebAssembly compilation (AssemblyScript), distributed systems (Caramel targeting Erlang VM), visual programming (Enso), audio synthesis (Glicol), DevOps scripting (NGS), and domain-specific applications like legislative programming (Catala) and data analysis (Empirical). The catalog targets language designers, academic researchers, and advanced developers interested in novel type systems, verification techniques, and specialized programming paradigms beyond mainstream languages, providing direct links to repositories, documentation, and interactive playgrounds for hands-on exploration.
