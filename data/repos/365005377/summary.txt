btop++ is a cross-platform system resource monitoring tool written in C++20 that provides real-time visualization of CPU, memory, disk I/O, network traffic, and GPU utilization through a terminal-based interface. Targeting the DevOps and system administration domain, it serves as a modern replacement for traditional Unix monitoring tools like top and htop, offering enhanced graphics, customizable themes, and comprehensive hardware monitoring capabilities. The application supports Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD platforms, utilizing platform-specific APIs to gather system metrics and render them using terminal escape sequences for rich visual output. Primary users include system administrators, DevOps engineers, and power users who need detailed real-time system performance monitoring with GPU support for modern hardware environments, making it particularly valuable for server management, performance troubleshooting, and resource optimization tasks.
