Ivy is an APL-like interpreter written in Go that provides a calculator environment for array programming and mathematical computation. Built for educational programming language enthusiasts and mathematical computing users, it implements APL's characteristic array manipulation operators, mathematical functions, and concise symbolic syntax. The interpreter supports bignum arithmetic, floating-point operations, text processing, and user-defined operators, making it suitable for numerical analysis, mathematical exploration, and teaching array programming concepts. Targeting researchers, mathematicians, and programming language hobbyists familiar with APL or J, Ivy serves as both a practical calculator tool and a demonstration of implementing domain-specific languages in Go, with cross-platform availability including mobile apps for iOS and Android.
