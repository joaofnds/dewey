**Ivy** is an APL-like language interpreter implemented in Go, offering a compact, expressive, and vector-oriented calculator for numerical and symbolic computations. It provides a custom domain with core features such as matrix operations, user-defined functions, and interactive REPL environment. The project serves as both a plaything and a potential foundation for more complex applications, with prototypes available for iOS and Android platforms. To leverage Ivy, users require Go 1.23 or later versions. While primarily designed for numerical and symbolic computations, its vector-based nature makes it suitable for various data analysis tasks, including vector embedding and clustering.
