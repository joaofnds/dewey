TypeGraphQL is a TypeScript library that enables declarative GraphQL API development by using classes and decorators to define schemas and resolvers, eliminating the need to maintain separate SDL schema files. Built on top of graphql-js, it targets web developers creating GraphQL APIs in Node.js environments who want to leverage TypeScript's type safety and modern language features. The library solves the code redundancy problem inherent in traditional GraphQL development where developers must maintain synchronized type definitions across GraphQL schemas, TypeScript interfaces, and ORM models. It provides decorator-based annotations like @ObjectType, @Field, @Query, and @Mutation to transform TypeScript classes into GraphQL types and resolvers, while supporting dependency injection, authorization guards, and validation. The framework primarily serves backend developers building type-safe GraphQL APIs who prefer code-first schema generation over schema-first approaches.
