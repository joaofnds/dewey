Traefik Mesh is a Kubernetes-native service mesh designed to simplify service-to-service communication. Built in Go, it provides a non-invasive approach by utilizing proxy endpoints on each node for routing, eliminating the need for sidecar containers. Key features include support for the Service Mesh Interface (SMI) specification, opt-in deployment, and configuration via annotations or SMI objects. This project is a standalone application focused on enhancing Kubernetes cluster networking, targeting system administrators and developers managing containerized applications.
