Traefik Mesh is a Kubernetes-native service mesh implementation written in Go that provides inter-service communication management, traffic routing, and security policies for containerized microservices architectures. Unlike traditional service mesh solutions that rely on sidecar containers, it uses a non-invasive approach with proxy endpoints running on each node and a centralized mesh controller for configuration management. The platform targets DevOps engineers and platform architects working with Kubernetes clusters, supporting Service Mesh Interface (SMI) specifications and integrating with CoreDNS for service discovery. It addresses the complexity of microservices networking by providing traffic management, observability, and security features through an opt-in model that doesn't modify existing Kubernetes objects or application traffic patterns until explicitly configured.
