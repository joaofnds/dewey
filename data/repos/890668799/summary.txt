This JavaScript repository presents a collection of reference implementations for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), focusing on providing Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources. The servers demonstrate MCP's versatility and extensibility, showcasing various use cases such as web content fetching, database interaction, file operations, and API integrations. Implemented using the TypeScript MCP SDK or Python MCP SDK, these servers serve as a foundation for building custom MCP servers tailored to specific needs. The repository also includes third-party servers, offering official integrations with platforms like 21st.dev Magic, Adfin, AgentQL, and more. This project is primarily aimed at developers seeking to leverage the Model Context Protocol in their applications.
