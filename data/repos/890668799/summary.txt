This repository contains reference implementations of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable Large Language Models to securely access external tools and data sources. Built primarily with TypeScript and Python SDKs, the collection spans multiple domains including cloud services (AWS, Google Drive, Aiven), databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis), version control systems (Git, GitHub, GitLab), web automation (Puppeteer, Brave Search), and developer tools. Each server acts as a bridge between LLMs and specific APIs or services, providing controlled access to functionalities like file operations, database queries, web scraping, and repository management. The servers demonstrate MCP's extensibility for AI application developers and system integrators who need to connect language models with existing infrastructure and external services while maintaining security boundaries.
