fx is a terminal-based JSON viewer and processor built in Go that provides interactive command-line and text user interface (TUI) capabilities for parsing, navigating, and manipulating JSON data structures. Targeting DevOps engineers, backend developers, and system administrators who work with APIs, configuration files, and log analysis, fx solves the problem of efficiently inspecting and processing JSON data directly in terminal environments without requiring external editors or browsers. The tool leverages Go's native JSON parsing capabilities and terminal UI libraries to deliver real-time JSON formatting, syntax highlighting, and interactive exploration features, making it particularly valuable for debugging API responses, analyzing structured logs, and working with configuration management in cloud-native and microservices architectures.
