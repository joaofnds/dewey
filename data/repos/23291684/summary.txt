`Canada` is an Elixir library providing a declarative permission definition system for Elixir applications. It enables developers to define readable and concise access control rules leveraging Elixir's pattern matching capabilities, addressing the need for permission management within applications. The library facilitates defining `can?` rules for resources like users and posts using the `Canada.Can` protocol. Designed as a developer productivity tool, it aims to provide a simplified alternative to frameworks like CanCan in Ruby, specifically targeting Elixir developers.
