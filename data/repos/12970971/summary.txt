This repository serves as the official collection of WebRTC JavaScript code samples and demonstrations, providing practical implementations of real-time communication features for web developers. Built entirely in JavaScript, it targets frontend web development and serves as both educational material and reference implementation for WebRTC APIs including peer-to-peer video calling, audio streaming, data channels, and media capture. The samples demonstrate core WebRTC functionality such as getUserMedia, RTCPeerConnection, and RTCDataChannel APIs, solving the common problem of understanding complex WebRTC implementation patterns. Designed for web developers learning WebRTC technologies or building real-time communication applications, the repository offers executable examples that can be tested locally via npm or accessed through a hosted GitHub Pages deployment at webrtc.github.io/samples.
