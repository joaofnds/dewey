The `webrtc/samples` repository provides JavaScript code samples and web demos for WebRTC, facilitating understanding and experimentation with real-time communication technologies in web browsers. These samples showcase various WebRTC functionalities, likely including peer-to-peer audio/video calls and data transmission, and are designed to be easily tested directly via a hosted website. It utilizes JavaScript as its primary language, and it functions as a set of example projects demonstrating WebRTC API usage. The project targets frontend developers and individuals interested in learning and implementing WebRTC-based web applications.
