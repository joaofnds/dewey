Calva is a Visual Studio Code extension written in TypeScript that provides an integrated development environment for Clojure and ClojureScript programming. It targets functional programming developers working in JVM-based ecosystems and web development with ClojureScript. The extension implements REPL-driven development capabilities including inline code evaluation, structural editing via Paredit, syntax highlighting, debugging, and linting through clj-kondo integration. It supports multiple Clojure build tools including Leiningen, tools/deps, shadow-cljs, Figwheel, and Gradle-based Clojurephant projects. The primary problem solved is bridging the gap between VS Code's popular editor interface and Clojure's REPL-centric development workflow, enabling productive Lisp programming without requiring Emacs or specialized Clojure IDEs. The extension leverages The Orchard project for REPL connectivity and targets both experienced Clojure developers and newcomers to functional programming.
