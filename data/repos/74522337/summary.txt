`remacs/remacs` is a community-driven port of the Emacs text editor, implemented in Rust. The project aims to provide Emacs functionality, including its extensive ecosystem and introspectability, while leveraging Rust's performance, tooling, and interoperability with C. Key features include porting Emacs Lisp functions to Rust and exploring new development approaches via a fork. Itâ€™s a standalone application focusing on improving developer productivity, using Emacs Lisp for configuration/extension and Rust for core functionality. The project targets developers and Emacs enthusiasts interested in a potentially performant and modern Emacs implementation, with emphasis on compatibility with existing Emacs Lisp code.
