Remacs is a community-driven fork of the GNU Emacs text editor that ports its C codebase to Rust while maintaining full compatibility with Emacs Lisp (Elisp). The project targets software developers and text editor users who require Emacs functionality with improved memory safety, better tooling, and enhanced performance characteristics provided by Rust's compile-time guarantees. It incrementally replaces C primitive functions with Rust implementations while preserving the complete Emacs Lisp environment, package ecosystem, and user interface. The project addresses technical debt, memory safety issues, and maintainability challenges inherent in Emacs' legacy C codebase by leveraging Rust's interoperability with C, allowing gradual migration without breaking existing workflows or Elisp packages used by Emacs developers and power users.
