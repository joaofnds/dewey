ElixirLS is a language server implementation that provides IDE-agnostic code intelligence and debugging capabilities for Elixir development. Built in Elixir, it implements the Language Server Protocol (LSP) and Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) standards to deliver features like code completion, go-to-definition, documentation lookup, Dialyzer static analysis, and step-through debugging across multiple editors including VS Code, Emacs, Vim, and Neovim. The project targets Elixir developers working on web applications, distributed systems, and other Elixir-based projects by solving the fragmented tooling ecosystem problemâ€”providing consistent, sophisticated development tools regardless of editor choice. It integrates with Elixir's build system (Mix), type checker (Dialyzer), and formatter while offering real-time error reporting and automated spec suggestion based on inferred success typings.
