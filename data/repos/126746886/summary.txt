ElixirLS is a language server and debug adapter designed to enhance the Elixir development experience. It provides code intelligence features such as code completion, go-to-definition, and documentation lookup, alongside integrated Dialyzer analysis for static code analysis. The project implements the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for IDE integration and the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) for debugging, offering features like breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, and expression evaluation. Built in Elixir, it is a plugin/extension primarily targeted at Elixir developers, supporting various IDEs and code editors through client-side integrations.
