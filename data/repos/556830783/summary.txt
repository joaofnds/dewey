Zap is a minimal plugin manager specifically designed for the Z shell (zsh), targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and command-line power users who need efficient shell customization. Built entirely in shell script, it provides a lightweight solution for installing, updating, and managing zsh plugins, themes, and completions from GitHub repositories or local filesystems. The tool addresses the common problem of zsh configuration management by offering simple `plug` commands to source plugins, automatic dependency handling, and lifecycle management through update/clean operations. It supports multiple installation sources including HTTPS/SSH GitHub cloning, GitLab integration, and local file sourcing, making it particularly valuable for developers working across different environments who require consistent, reproducible shell configurations without the overhead of more complex plugin management systems.
