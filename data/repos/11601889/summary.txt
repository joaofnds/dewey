Gonum Plot is a Go-based data visualization library that provides programmatic plotting and charting capabilities for scientific computing and data analysis applications. Built as the official successor to plotinum, it offers a modular architecture with separate packages for core plotting primitives (`plot`), standard chart types (`plotter` for scatter plots, box plots, error bars), utilities (`plotutil`), and vector graphics backends (`vg` supporting EPS, SVG, PDF, and GUI outputs). The library targets Go developers, data scientists, and researchers working in computational domains who need to generate publication-quality plots and visualizations programmatically. It solves the problem of limited native plotting capabilities in Go by providing a comprehensive, extensible plotting framework that integrates with the broader Gonum scientific computing ecosystem for statistical analysis and mathematical computation workflows.
