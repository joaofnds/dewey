`yeetgif` is a Go-based command-line interface (CLI) tool for generating animated GIFs, primarily focused on creating custom emoji and visual effects for platforms like Slack and Discord. It provides a range of image manipulation functionalities, including roll, wobble, pulse, zoom, shake, fried, hue, tint, and text overlay effects, enabling users to compose complex GIF animations through command-line pipes. The project is a standalone application with no external dependencies beyond the Go standard library, and provides binary distributions for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The tool leverages third-party libraries for image processing, including modified versions of imaging, ggtext, and box2d and integrates with external tools for GIF optimization.
