yeetgif is a command-line tool written in Go that applies visual effects and transformations to GIF images, specifically designed for creating custom animated emoji for Slack and Discord platforms. The single-binary application provides cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows) with no external dependencies and offers composable effects including wobble, shake, pulse, zoom, hue shifts, deep-frying filters, and text overlays. It processes GIF files through stdin/stdout pipelines, enabling chained transformations with options for optimization via giflossy integration. The tool targets developers, community managers, and digital content creators who need to programmatically generate meme-style animated graphics for workplace communication platforms. Its raw output mode enables lossless intermediate processing steps, while metadata embedding allows effect reconstruction for reproducible workflows.
