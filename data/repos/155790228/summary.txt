SQLFluff is a Python-based SQL linter and auto-formatter designed for data engineering and analytics workflows, particularly ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) applications. It provides dialect-flexible parsing and rule-based validation for over 20 SQL variants including BigQuery, Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Spark, and dbt, with built-in support for Jinja templating and parameterized queries. The tool offers both linting (error detection) and automatic code fixing capabilities through a modular rule engine, enabling data engineers and analytics developers to enforce consistent SQL code quality and formatting standards across heterogeneous database environments. SQLFluff integrates into CI/CD pipelines and development workflows via CLI, Docker, and VS Code extension, addressing the challenge of maintaining clean, standardized SQL code in modern data stack implementations where multiple SQL dialects and templating systems coexist.
