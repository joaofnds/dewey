`typos` is a command-line application written in Rust designed to identify and correct spelling errors within source code files. It functions as a code-quality tool, scanning codebases and suggesting corrections for typos, aiming to reduce false positives and be fast enough for use in monorepos and integration into pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipelines. Core functionality includes the ability to detect typos, automatically suggest or apply corrections using a `--write-changes` flag, and integrate with editors and CI systems like GitHub Actions. This project is a standalone CLI application intended for developers focused on improving code quality and maintaining consistency in their codebase.
