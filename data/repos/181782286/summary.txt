**typos** is a high-performance source code spell checker written in Rust, designed for software development workflows and code quality assurance. It targets developers, DevOps engineers, and development teams who need to automatically detect and correct spelling mistakes in codebases, documentation, and configuration files. The tool is optimized for large-scale repositories (monorepos) with minimal false positives, making it suitable for CI/CD pipelines, pull request validation, and pre-commit hooks. Built as a CLI application, it integrates with GitHub Actions, pre-commit frameworks, Visual Studio Code, and supports programmatic usage through JSON output formats. The system uses configurable dictionaries and regex patterns to handle technical terminology, proper nouns, and domain-specific language while providing real-time diff generation and automated correction capabilities for maintaining code documentation standards.
