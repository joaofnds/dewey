**whatthefuck.is** is a curated glossary website that provides opinionated definitions of computer science terms specifically tailored for front-end developers. Built primarily with CSS and targeting the JavaScript/web development ecosystem, it serves as an educational reference resource for frontend engineers seeking clear explanations of technical concepts. Created by Dan Abramov (React core team member), the project addresses the knowledge gap between computer science fundamentals and practical frontend development work. The repository operates as a static website where the community can request definitions through GitHub issues and vote on priorities, though content creation remains controlled by the author. It solves the problem of CS terminology being inaccessible or poorly explained for developers focused on UI/UX implementation rather than theoretical computer science.
