Toot is a minimalist web server framework for Common Lisp, derived from Edi Weitz's established Hunchentoot HTTP server by removing extensive functionality to create a streamlined alternative. Targeting web development in the Lisp ecosystem, it serves developers who need a simplified HTTP server foundation without the complexity of Hunchentoot's full feature set. The project addresses the common need for lightweight web server implementations by sacrificing backwards compatibility and comprehensive functionality for reduced complexity and easier comprehension. Intended for Common Lisp developers building web applications who prefer minimal dependencies and straightforward server architecture, Toot represents a deliberate reduction approach to web framework design, prioritizing simplicity over feature completeness in the specialized domain of Lisp-based web development.
