Rufo is an opinionated Ruby code formatter designed for software development teams working with Ruby applications. Built using Ruby's native Ripper parser and lexer, it automatically formats Ruby source code to enforce consistent styling while preserving intentional alignment choices like parameter alignment and whitespace formatting. Unlike configurable linters such as RuboCop, Rufo follows a "zero-configuration" philosophy similar to gofmt and prettier, providing minimal customization options through `.rufo` configuration files. The tool integrates with popular text editors (VS Code, Vim, Sublime Text, Emacs) via plugins and supports command-line usage for CI/CD pipelines, targeting Ruby developers who need automated code formatting without extensive configuration overhead while maintaining code readability and team formatting standards.
