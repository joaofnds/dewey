Rufo is a Ruby code formatter designed to automatically format Ruby source code, aiming for a "one true format" with minimal configuration. It functions primarily as a command-line tool and editor plugin, integrating with various text editors (e.g., Vim, VS Code) to enable on-save code formatting. Leveraging the Ruby parser and lexer (Ripper), Rufo focuses on preserving code style choices where practical, while ensuring code consistency and readability. It's a Ruby gem, targeting Ruby developers seeking automated code style enforcement.
