Glow is a Go-based command-line interface (CLI) tool that renders Markdown files with enhanced visual formatting in terminal environments. Built for developers and system administrators working in CLI-heavy workflows, it provides both a textual user interface (TUI) for browsing local Markdown files and direct CLI rendering capabilities. The tool integrates with Git repositories to discover documentation, supports remote file fetching from GitHub/GitLab and HTTP endpoints, and offers customizable styling with JSON stylesheets. Targeting the developer tooling and DevOps domain, Glow solves the problem of reading documentation and Markdown content directly in terminal sessions without switching to graphical applications, supporting features like word wrapping, paging integration, and automatic dark/light theme detection for improved CLI-based documentation workflows.
