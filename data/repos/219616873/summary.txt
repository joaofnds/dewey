`Glow` is a Go-based command-line interface (CLI) application designed to render Markdown files with enhanced visual presentation within a terminal. It provides a TUI for browsing local and Git repository Markdown files and a CLI for rendering Markdown from files, standard input, or remote URLs, supporting features like word wrapping, style customization, and integration with a pager. This standalone application enables developers to read and format Markdown documentation and content directly in the terminal environment using a variety of configuration options. The project leverages Go's capabilities for building performant CLI tools and integrates with external libraries for style management and paging.
