git-filter-repo is a Python-based Git history rewriting tool designed to replace the deprecated git filter-branch command with significantly improved performance and capabilities. Targeting DevOps engineers, Git administrators, and developers working with large repositories, it provides a comprehensive solution for repository maintenance tasks including removing sensitive files, restructuring directory layouts, splitting repositories, and cleaning commit history. The tool leverages Git's fast-export/fast-import mechanisms to achieve orders-of-magnitude performance improvements over traditional approaches, while offering both command-line utilities and a Python library for custom filtering scripts. It addresses critical repository management challenges in enterprise environments where teams need to sanitize codebases, migrate repository structures, or comply with data retention policies without the prohibitive execution times associated with legacy Git tools.
