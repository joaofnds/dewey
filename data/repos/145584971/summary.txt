`git-filter-repo` is a Python-based command-line tool designed to efficiently rewrite Git repository history, serving as a replacement for the often slow and error-prone `git filter-branch`. It provides a comprehensive set of features for tasks like path filtering, renaming, and commit message modification, with built-in mechanisms for handling common issues such as empty commits and inconsistent references. Beyond its standalone application, `git-filter-repo` functions as a library, allowing developers to construct custom history rewriting tools. Its architecture heavily relies on the Python programming language for both its core logic and user extensibility, aiming at providing speed and safety for complex repository modifications compared to alternative approaches.
