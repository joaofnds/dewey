fontpreview is a bash-based command-line font management and preview tool designed for Linux desktop environments and system administration workflows. It integrates fzf for fuzzy searching through locally installed fonts, ImageMagick for generating font preview images, and nsxiv for display rendering, targeting developers, designers, and power users who need efficient font selection capabilities. The tool addresses the problem of quickly identifying and evaluating fonts from large system font collections without opening GUI applications, supporting common font formats (.otf, .ttf, .woff) and offering extensive customization through environment variables and command-line flags. It can generate standalone preview images for integration with terminal file managers like vifm using Ã¼berzug, making it particularly valuable for terminal-centric development workflows and system administration tasks requiring font management.
