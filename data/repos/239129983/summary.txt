`fontpreview` is a command-line application written in Bash designed for quickly searching and previewing installed fonts. It leverages `fzf` for fuzzy search functionality and `imagemagick` and `nsxiv` to generate and display font previews. Highly customizable through command-line arguments and environment variables, it allows users to specify font size, colors, preview text, and window positioning, with single-font preview generation capabilities. This is a standalone command-line utility intended for Linux users, particularly those interested in font management and customization, and can be integrated with other tools like terminal file managers.
