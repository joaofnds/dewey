`mini_phone` is a Ruby gem providing fast and robust phone number parsing, validation, and formatting functionalities. Leveraging Google's C++ `libphonenumber` library for spec-compliance and performance, it offers methods for validating number formats, converting to E.164 format, and determining phone number types (mobile, fixed line, etc.). This library is designed as a high-performance alternative to existing Ruby phone number libraries, targeting Ruby developers requiring efficient phone number handling within their applications.
