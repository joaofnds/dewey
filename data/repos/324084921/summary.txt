MiniPhone is a high-performance Ruby gem that provides phone number parsing, validation, and formatting capabilities by binding directly to Google's libphonenumber C++ library. Targeting Ruby web developers and applications requiring telecommunications data processing, it offers methods for validating phone numbers, formatting them in multiple standards (E.164, national, international, RFC3966), determining number types (mobile, fixed-line, toll-free), and checking number feasibility. The gem achieves 70-80x performance improvements over pure Ruby alternatives like Phonelib and TelephoneNumber by leveraging native C++ bindings rather than implementing phone number logic in Ruby, making it suitable for high-throughput web applications requiring spec-compliant international phone number handling.
