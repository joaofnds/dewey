KaTeX is a JavaScript library for rendering mathematical notation on web pages, serving as a fast alternative to server-side LaTeX compilation. Built for web developers and technical content creators, it parses TeX/LaTeX mathematical expressions and converts them into HTML/CSS output with print-quality typography based on Donald Knuth's TeX algorithms. The library operates synchronously without page reflow, supports both client-side and Node.js server-side rendering, and includes an auto-render extension for automatic math detection in HTML documents. KaTeX addresses the need for fast, self-contained mathematical typesetting in web applications, educational platforms, scientific documentation, and online publishing systems where mathematical formulas must be displayed with professional quality and cross-browser compatibility.
