`Broot` is a command-line application written in Rust designed to improve directory navigation and file management. It provides an interactive terminal interface for viewing directory trees with features like fuzzy search, file previewing, and integrated commands for actions like moving and deleting files. Key functionalities include rapid directory exploration, file finding via typing, and the ability to execute shell commands directly from within its interface. The project is a standalone CLI tool aimed at enhancing developer productivity within the Linux and similar command-line environments, providing an alternative to standard `ls` and `tree` commands.
