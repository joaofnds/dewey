evil-surround is an Emacs Lisp package that ports the functionality of vim-surround to the Evil vi-emulation layer for Emacs, enabling efficient manipulation of surrounding characters like quotes, brackets, and HTML tags. Targeting text editor users and developers who prefer vi-style modal editing within Emacs, it provides key bindings for adding (ys/yS), changing (cs), and deleting (ds) surrounding pairs around text objects or visual selections. The package integrates with Evil's text object system and supports extensible surround pairs through customizable alists, buffer-local configurations for different programming modes, and integration with operators beyond the default change/delete actions. It serves developers across various programming domains who require rapid text manipulation capabilities while maintaining vi-like editing workflows in their Emacs environment.
