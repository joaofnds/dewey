Realm Tasks is a deprecated cross-platform to-do application, inspired by Clear for iOS, demonstrating real-time data synchronization using Realm. The application supports iOS (Swift), Android, and macOS platforms, allowing users to create and manage tasks, with changes reflected across instances. It utilizes Realm Swift for data persistence, Realm LoginKit for authentication, and Cartography for layout constraints. The project showcases a client-side application using the Realm Mobile Database and Realm Object Server.
