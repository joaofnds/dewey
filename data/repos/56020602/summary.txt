Realm Tasks is a deprecated cross-platform task management application designed as a technical demonstration and testbed for Realm database synchronization technologies. Built primarily in Swift with companion implementations in Android, React Native, and Xamarin, it showcases real-time data synchronization across multiple platforms using Realm Object Server and Realm Cloud infrastructure. The application targets mobile and desktop developers interested in implementing cross-platform data synchronization patterns, featuring authentication, real-time updates, and multi-device sync capabilities. Key technologies include Realm Swift database, CocoaPods dependency management, Realm LoginKit for authentication, and Cartography for iOS auto layout constraints. The project serves as a reference implementation for developers building synchronized mobile applications that require seamless data sharing between iOS, Android, macOS, and other platforms within the Realm ecosystem.
