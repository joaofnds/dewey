This repository provides an end-to-end tutorial for implementing Kubernetes deployment pipelines using Google Cloud Container Builder, demonstrating multi-environment application propagation across dedicated Kubernetes clusters. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform administrators, it establishes a GitOps-based CI/CD workflow where code changes trigger automated builds and deployments through staging and production environments via separate GitHub repositories and Kubernetes manifest files. The tutorial uses a simple Go application to illustrate container building, cluster provisioning, build trigger configuration, and automated deployment orchestration across multiple Kubernetes Engine clusters, enabling fine-grained access control and environment isolation for enterprise deployment strategies.
