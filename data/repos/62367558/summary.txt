Hyper is a cross-platform terminal emulator built using web technologies including TypeScript, React, HTML, and CSS, targeting developers and command-line interface users across Linux, macOS, and Windows. The application leverages Electron to package web-based UI components into a native desktop terminal application, providing an extensible alternative to traditional terminal emulators. It utilizes node-pty for pseudo-terminal functionality and implements a plugin-based architecture for customization. The project addresses the need for a modern, themeable, and extensible terminal experience while maintaining performance and stability standards. Primary users include software developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who require advanced terminal functionality with web-based styling capabilities and cross-platform consistency.
