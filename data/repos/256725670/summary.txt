pattern.css is a lightweight CSS-only library designed for frontend web development that provides decorative background patterns through pure CSS classes. Built with SCSS and weighing less than 1KB minified, it offers 12 distinct pattern types (checks, grids, dots, stripes, lines, triangles, zigzag) across four size variants each, totaling 48 pattern classes. The library integrates seamlessly with existing CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and utility-first frameworks, using CSS background-image properties with SVG data URIs to generate geometric patterns. It solves the common frontend problem of creating visually appealing background textures without requiring JavaScript, image assets, or custom CSS implementation. Target users are frontend developers, UI/UX designers, and web developers seeking ready-to-use pattern solutions for modern web applications with full browser compatibility.
