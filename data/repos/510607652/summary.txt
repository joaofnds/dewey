PocketBase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) framework written in Go that provides a complete backend solution in a single executable file. It targets web and mobile developers who need rapid backend deployment without complex infrastructure setup. The system combines an embedded SQLite database with realtime WebSocket subscriptions, RESTful APIs, built-in authentication and user management, file storage capabilities, and an administrative dashboard UI. PocketBase can be used as either a standalone application or integrated as a Go library framework for custom business logic. It addresses the problem of backend complexity for small to medium-scale applications by offering Firebase-like functionality with self-hosting capabilities, supporting JavaScript and Dart SDK clients for frontend integration across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.
