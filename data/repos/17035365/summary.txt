vim-projectionist is a Vim plugin that provides granular project configuration through JSON-based "projections" for enhanced file navigation and project-specific settings. Built entirely in Vim Script, it targets software developers across multiple domains by enabling custom navigation commands (`:Ecommand`, `:Ehook`), intelligent alternate file switching (`:A` commands), and per-project buffer configuration through `.projections.json` files or global heuristics. The plugin solves the problem of efficiently navigating complex project structures by creating semantic file relationships and project-aware commands, supporting diverse development environments from Ruby/Rails projects to Maven-based Java applications, rbenv plugins, and generic codebases. It integrates with other Vim ecosystem tools like dispatch.vim and rails.vim, making it particularly valuable for Vim power users who work across multiple programming languages and project architectures requiring different navigation patterns and build configurations.
