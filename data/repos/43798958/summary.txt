**org-alert** is an Emacs Lisp package that provides automated system notifications for Org mode agenda items, targeting productivity-focused Emacs users and knowledge workers who rely on Org mode for task management. The package integrates with Emacs' built-in Org mode agenda system and leverages the `alert` library to deliver cross-platform notifications (libnotify, native system notifications) for scheduled tasks and deadlines. It continuously monitors Org agenda files through configurable timer intervals, parsing scheduled and deadline entries while filtering out completed tasks marked with DONE states. Key features include customizable notification cutoff times, per-item reminder intervals via Org properties, flexible regex-based agenda parsing, and support for various notification backends. The package addresses the common problem of missed deadlines and forgotten scheduled tasks by bridging Emacs' powerful Org mode planning capabilities with modern desktop notification systems, making it essential for developers, researchers, and professionals who manage complex project workflows within the Emacs ecosystem.
