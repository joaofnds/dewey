`org-alert` is an Emacs Lisp package providing system notifications for scheduled and deadline-driven items within Org-mode agenda files. Its core functionality includes periodic checking of the agenda, parsing for scheduled or due entries, and displaying notifications using the Emacs `alert` package, with customization options for notification styles, intervals, titles, categories, and regular expressions for agenda entry and time matching. This is a plugin/extension designed to enhance the Emacs/Org-mode user experience by integrating time-sensitive agenda reminders directly into the operating system's notification system, targeting users of the Emacs text editor and Org-mode.
