Restic is a cross-platform backup utility written in Go that implements cryptographically secure, deduplicated data backups with snapshot-based versioning. The tool targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and power users requiring enterprise-grade backup solutions across Linux, macOS, Windows, and BSD systems. It employs content-defined chunking and deduplication algorithms to minimize storage overhead while maintaining AES-256 encryption for data confidentiality and integrity. Restic supports multiple storage backends including local filesystems, SFTP, REST servers, cloud providers (AWS S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, BackBlaze B2), and rclone-compatible services. The application addresses the critical infrastructure need for reliable, incremental backups with fast restore capabilities, offering FUSE mounting for browsing historical snapshots and verification tools for backup integrity validation.
