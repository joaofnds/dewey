Fishery is a TypeScript library designed to facilitate the creation of test data by enabling the definition and use of object factories. These factories generate typed JavaScript objects, offering type-checking during both definition and usage, thus ensuring data validity within testing scenarios. Key features include the ability to define factories with typed parameters, incorporate asynchronous operations using the `create` method, and extend factories through methods like `params`, `transient`, and `associations`. This library is specifically targeted at TypeScript developers focused on improving the efficiency and reliability of their testing workflows.
