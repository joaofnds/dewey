Fishery is a TypeScript-first test data factory library for JavaScript/Node.js applications, designed for web developers who need to generate consistent test fixtures and mock objects. Modeled after Ruby's factory_bot gem, it provides a strongly-typed API for defining object factories that can build() synchronous test data or create() asynchronous database records with full TypeScript inference and compile-time validation. The library targets JavaScript/TypeScript developers working on web applications, APIs, and testing suites who require reliable, type-safe data generation for unit tests, integration tests, and development environments. It solves the common problem of maintaining consistent, realistic test data across large codebases while leveraging TypeScript's type system to prevent runtime errors and ensure data integrity during test execution.
