TruffleRuby is a high-performance Ruby language implementation built on Oracle's GraalVM polyglot runtime platform, targeting Ruby developers seeking performance optimization for CPU-intensive applications. It leverages the Truffle language implementation framework and Graal just-in-time compiler to deliver faster execution than standard Ruby (MRI/CRuby), while maintaining compatibility with existing Ruby codebases and C extensions. The implementation eliminates Ruby's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) to enable true parallel execution of Ruby code and thread-safe native extensions. TruffleRuby serves web developers, application developers, and systems programmers who need Ruby's productivity with enhanced performance characteristics, offering both native standalone and JVM configurations for different deployment scenarios while supporting polyglot interoperability with Java, JavaScript, Python, and WebAssembly within the GraalVM ecosystem.
