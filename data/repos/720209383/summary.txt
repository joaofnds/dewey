Cap is an open-source screen recording and video messaging application that serves as an alternative to Loom, targeting content creators, developers, and professionals who need to create shareable screen recordings. Built as a Turborepo monorepo, it combines a Tauri-based desktop application using Rust backend with SolidStart frontend, and a Next.js web application for video sharing and management. The architecture leverages TypeScript, React, Drizzle ORM with MySQL for data persistence, and TailwindCSS for styling. The desktop app handles native screen capture and recording functionality across macOS and Windows, while the web platform manages video hosting, sharing, and playback. This addresses the need for privacy-conscious video communication tools in the productivity and developer tooling domain.
