`turfwar` is a standalone web application designed as a game to encourage interaction across diverse IPv4 addresses. Built using a redbean server, the application's core functionality involves users accessing the webserver from as many unique IP addresses as possible, fostering creative engagement. The project's architecture directly leverages the redbean web server, a single-file, self-contained webserver. This example project demonstrates a concise approach to testing and engaging with IP address-based interaction.
