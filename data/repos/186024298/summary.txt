Nushell is a modern command-line shell built in Rust that reimagines shell interaction through structured data processing and pipeline-based workflows. Unlike traditional Unix shells that treat data as raw text streams, Nushell operates on structured data types, enabling users to manipulate files, directories, and command outputs as tables and objects. The shell targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and power users who need advanced data manipulation capabilities in their terminal workflows. It features a pipeline architecture where commands produce, filter, or consume structured data streams, supporting operations like filtering directories with `where type == "dir"` and displaying results in formatted tables. Nushell addresses the limitation of text-based shell scripting by providing native support for JSON, CSV, and other structured formats, making it particularly valuable for automation tasks and data processing workflows in modern infrastructure management.
