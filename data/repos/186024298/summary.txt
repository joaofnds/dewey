Nushell is a cross-platform, structured shell built in Rust, designed as a modern command-line interface emphasizing data handling and pipeline operations. It moves beyond treating data as simple text streams, enabling users to interact with structured data formats like TOML, JSON, and tables natively. Key functionalities include robust pipeline support for filtering and transforming data, file/URL content loading, and plugin architecture for extending functionality, making it a developer productivity tool that aims to enhance the command-line experience. This is a standalone, interactive command-line application (CLI) offering an alternative to traditional shells, targeting system administrators and developers.
