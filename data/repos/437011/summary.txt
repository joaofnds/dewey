OpenZFS is an advanced file system and volume manager implementation for Linux and FreeBSD operating systems, primarily written in C. This repository provides kernel-level storage infrastructure targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and enterprise storage professionals who require enterprise-grade data management capabilities. The project implements ZFS filesystem features including copy-on-write snapshots, data deduplication, compression, RAID-Z redundancy, and checksumming for data integrity. It operates as kernel modules and userspace utilities, integrating directly with Linux and FreeBSD kernel APIs to provide advanced storage pool management, automatic error correction, and scalable storage virtualization. The system addresses complex storage challenges in data centers, cloud infrastructure, and high-availability environments where data reliability, performance, and flexible storage management are critical requirements for mission-critical applications and large-scale storage deployments.
