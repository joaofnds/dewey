Apache Avro is a cross-platform data serialization system designed for big data applications and distributed computing environments. It provides schema-based binary serialization with support for schema evolution, enabling efficient data exchange between systems written in different programming languages including Java, Python, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, Perl, and JavaScript. The framework addresses the critical need for compact, fast serialization in data-intensive applications like Apache Kafka message streaming, Hadoop ecosystems, and microservices architectures. Avro's schema registry functionality allows backward and forward compatibility during data format changes, making it essential for data engineers, backend developers, and distributed systems architects working with high-volume data pipelines and inter-service communication protocols.
