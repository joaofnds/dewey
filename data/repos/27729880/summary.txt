gRPC is a high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework built on a shared C++ core library that enables transparent client-server communication across distributed systems. Targeting backend developers, microservices architects, and system integrators in web development and distributed computing domains, it provides language bindings for C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Objective-C, and C# within this repository, with additional implementations available for Java, Go, Node.js, and other languages. The framework leverages HTTP/2 transport protocol and Protocol Buffers for efficient serialization, solving the complexity of inter-service communication in microservices architectures, API development, and cross-platform distributed applications. It serves developers building scalable backend services, cloud-native applications, and polyglot systems requiring robust, type-safe communication between services running on different platforms and programming languages.
