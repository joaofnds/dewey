**legit** is an esoteric programming language implemented in Ruby that uses Git repository commit graphs as executable code, where program logic is defined by commit messages and control flow follows the repository's branching structure. This domain-specific language targets programming language enthusiasts and computer science researchers interested in unconventional computational models, drawing inspiration from esoteric languages like Brainfuck and Befunge. The implementation includes both a Ruby-based interpreter using the rugged gem for Git operations and an LLVM IR compiler that produces optimized native binaries. Programs utilize a stack-based architecture with tape memory operations, executing instructions embedded in commit messages while navigating through Git history based on branching patterns, making repository visualization tools like `git log --graph` essential for program comprehension and debugging.
