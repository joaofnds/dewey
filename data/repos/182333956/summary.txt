`legit` is an esoteric programming language where programs are defined by the commit graph of a Git repository, ignoring the content of files. It provides a stack and a Brainfuck-inspired tape data structure for memory management, with instructions executed sequentially from commit messages. Written in Ruby, it includes an interpreter for development and a compiler that generates LLVM IR, allowing for optimized binary creation using tools like `clang`. This is a standalone application (CLI) and programming language, targeting developers interested in exploring unconventional computational paradigms.
