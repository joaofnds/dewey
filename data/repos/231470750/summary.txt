This shell script provides a fuzzy-finding interface for tmuxinator project management in terminal-based development workflows. It integrates three command-line tools—fzf (fuzzy finder), tmuxinator (tmux session manager), and tmux (terminal multiplexer)—to create an interactive project launcher that allows developers to quickly select and start pre-configured development environments. The tool addresses the friction of managing multiple tmux sessions across different projects by offering multi-select capabilities and automatic session attachment. It supports both interactive selection through fzf's interface and direct query-based launching for single matches. This utility primarily serves software developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who rely on terminal-based workflows and need efficient session management across multiple codebases or development environments, particularly those already using tmuxinator for tmux session configuration management.
