This shell script provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool for efficiently starting tmuxinator projects. It leverages `fzf` to present a user-friendly, interactive selection list of tmuxinator projects, allowing for multi-selection and launching of multiple projects simultaneously. Upon project selection, the script executes `tmuxinator start` for each chosen project and attaches to the tmux session or provides a session selection interface if tmux is already running. It is designed for developer productivity and integrates the `tmux`, `tmuxinator`, and `fzf` utilities, targeting users of these tools within a terminal environment. The project is distributed as a standalone CLI utility.
