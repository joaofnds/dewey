Spectacle is a standalone macOS application designed to manage window layout and organization without requiring mouse interaction. Built using Objective-C, it primarily provides customizable keyboard shortcuts to resize and reposition application windows to predefined regions, including full-screen, halves, thirds, and multiple display support. It leverages the macOS Accessibility Protocol for window manipulation and utilizes Carthage for dependency management. This project is a developer productivity tool, enabling efficient window management for macOS users through keyboard-driven actions.
