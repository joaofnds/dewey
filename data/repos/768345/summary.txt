Spectacle is an Objective-C macOS desktop application that provides window management functionality through keyboard shortcuts, eliminating the need for mouse-based window manipulation. Built for macOS system administration and productivity workflows, it leverages Apple's Accessibility Protocol APIs to programmatically control window positioning, sizing, and multi-display management. The application enables users to snap windows to predefined screen regions (halves, thirds, quarters), resize windows incrementally, move windows between displays, and undo/redo window actions through customizable hotkey combinations. Targeted at macOS power users, developers, and system administrators who require efficient workspace organization, Spectacle addresses the native macOS limitation of lacking built-in window tiling capabilities similar to Linux window managers or Windows Snap features.
