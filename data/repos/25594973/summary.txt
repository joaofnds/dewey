Buffalo is a comprehensive web development framework for Go that provides a Rails-inspired, full-stack development environment for rapid web application creation. Built on established Go libraries including Gorilla Mux for routing, Plush templating engine, Pop ORM for database operations, and Gorilla toolkit components for sessions and WebSockets, Buffalo generates complete web projects with integrated front-end and back-end scaffolding. The framework targets Go web developers seeking accelerated development workflows by providing opinionated project structure, code generation tools, and pre-configured integration between database layers, routing, templating, and asset management. Buffalo requires Go modules and supports the latest two Go versions, offering a holistic alternative to building web applications from scratch using individual Go packages.
