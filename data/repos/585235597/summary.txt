Service Weaver is a Go-based programming framework for building and deploying distributed cloud applications. It targets cloud-native software development by providing a unified development experience where applications can be written, tested, and debugged locally as monoliths, then deployed as distributed microservices to cloud platforms like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with minimal configuration changes. The framework abstracts the complexity of distributed systems architecture, service discovery, and inter-service communication, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns. It primarily serves backend developers and DevOps engineers working on cloud-native applications who need to manage the transition from local development to production distributed deployments while maintaining code simplicity and operational efficiency.
