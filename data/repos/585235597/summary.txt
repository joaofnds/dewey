Service Weaver is a Go-based programming framework designed for developing, deploying, and managing distributed cloud applications. This framework allows users to write applications that can be run locally for testing and debugging and deployed to the cloud with a single command, simplifying the transition from development to production. It provides a unified approach to building and operating distributed systems. The project is now in maintenance mode, with plans to archive the repository in the future.
