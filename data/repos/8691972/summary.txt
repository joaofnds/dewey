hl-todo is an Emacs Lisp package that provides syntax highlighting for TODO keywords (TODO, FIXME, DEBUG, etc.) within code comments and strings across programming languages. Designed for software developers using the Emacs text editor, it implements a minor mode that applies customizable color-coding to task-related annotations in source code. The package offers navigation commands for jumping between TODO items, integration with Emacs tools like occur and rgrep for searching, and extensibility through flymake integration for linting workflows. It addresses the common development need to visually track inline code annotations and technical debt markers, supporting developer productivity by making TODO comments more prominent and searchable within the Emacs development environment across any programming language or file type.
