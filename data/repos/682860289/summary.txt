conform.nvim is a Lua-based formatter plugin for Neovim that provides intelligent code formatting across multiple programming languages and file types. It solves critical editor integration problems by preserving extmarks, folds, and cursor positions through minimal diff-based formatting, unlike traditional formatters that replace entire buffers. The plugin supports over 100 formatters including black, prettier, rustfmt, stylua, and biome, enabling per-filetype configuration with sequential or fallback formatting chains. It enhances LSP formatting capabilities by fixing poorly-behaved language servers and enables range formatting for formatters that don't natively support it. Primary users are software developers working in polyglot environments who need reliable, non-disruptive code formatting integrated into their Neovim workflow, with support for embedded code blocks and injected language formatting in markdown and similar files.
