`conform.nvim` is a Lua-based Neovim plugin designed to provide lightweight yet powerful code formatting capabilities. It leverages built-in LSP format utilities to preserve extmarks and folds while applying minimal diffs, and also corrects issues with poorly-behaving LSP formatters. The plugin offers a simple API mimicking `vim.lsp.buf.format()` along with support for range formatting and formatting embedded code blocks. The project functions as a Neovim plugin, providing a centralized and customizable interface for various code formatters written in diverse languages such as Lua, Python, and Rust, primarily targeting Neovim users aiming to streamline their coding workflow.
