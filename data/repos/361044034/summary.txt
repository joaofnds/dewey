Slidev is a modern presentation framework designed specifically for developers, enabling the creation of technical slides using Markdown syntax with embedded Vue.js components. Built on Vite for fast development and Vue 3 for interactivity, it targets software developers who need to create code-heavy presentations with live coding demonstrations, syntax highlighting via Shiki/Monaco Editor, and mathematical expressions through LaTeX/KaTeX. The framework integrates UnoCSS for styling, supports Mermaid diagrams, provides presenter mode functionality, and includes built-in recording capabilities. It addresses the common developer need for presentations that seamlessly blend documentation, code examples, and interactive demonstrations while maintaining version control compatibility through its Markdown-based approach, offering export options to PDF, PNG, and PPTX formats.
