Colima is a standalone, Go-based CLI application designed to provide container runtimes, including Docker, containerd, and Incus, on macOS and Linux with minimal setup. It facilitates container management by integrating with container runtimes, supporting features like automatic port forwarding, volume mounts, and multiple instance management. The project enables users to easily utilize container technologies like Docker Compose, Kubernetes (k8s), and nerdctl via its straightforward interface. Its core architectural element is a virtual machine (VM) that can be customized and managed with the CLI tool, using Lima as a base.
