tmux-thumbs is a Rust-based tmux plugin that provides keyboard-driven text selection and copying functionality similar to browser extensions like vimium/vimperator. It automatically detects and highlights various patterns in tmux panes including file paths, Git SHAs, IP addresses, UUIDs, hex colors, Docker images, and Kubernetes resources, then assigns keyboard hints for rapid selection and copying to the tmux buffer. The tool serves system administrators, DevOps engineers, and terminal-heavy developers who need efficient text extraction from command-line output, log files, and terminal sessions. Built as a performance-optimized replacement for tmux-fingers, it integrates with the tmux plugin ecosystem through TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager) and offers extensive customization options for hint appearance, key bindings, and custom regex patterns, addressing the workflow needs of users who spend significant time in terminal multiplexer environments.
