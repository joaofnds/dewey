`tmux-thumbs` is a Rust-based plugin designed to enhance tmux's copy/paste functionality, providing a lightning-fast alternative to `tmux-fingers`. Its core function is to enable vimium/vimperator-like text selection and copying within tmux panes, identifying and highlighting patterns such as file paths, URLs, and more. The plugin utilizes a customizable alphabet for hint generation, supports multi-selection, and integrates with the system clipboard. Furthermore, it can be used as a standalone command-line tool, demonstrating a broader scope beyond just a tmux plugin and targeting developers who work within a terminal environment.
