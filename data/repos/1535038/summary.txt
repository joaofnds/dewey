Sloth is a native macOS system administration and debugging tool that provides a graphical interface for the Unix `lsof` command-line utility. Built in Objective-C using Cocoa frameworks, it displays comprehensive information about all open files, directories, IP sockets, Unix domain sockets, pipes, and devices currently in use by running processes. The application targets system administrators, developers, and power users who need to inspect system resources, debug file access issues, monitor network connections, or identify which processes are using specific files or ports. Key features include filtering by process attributes, detailed socket information (protocol, port, status), inter-process communication visualization, and root privilege escalation for complete system scanning, making it essential for macOS system monitoring and troubleshooting workflows.
