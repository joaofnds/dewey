`vim-notes` is a Vim plugin designed to streamline note-taking within the Vim text editor. It facilitates the creation, organization, and retrieval of notes through commands for starting, saving, editing, deleting, and searching notes, leveraging features like title-based file management and tab completion. The plugin supports note navigation, including syntax highlighting and text folding using atx-style headers, with integration for hyperlinks between notes and file type extensions to support embedded file types. Written in VimL, the plugin enhances the standard Vim environment for developer productivity and note management, incorporating optional Python scripting for accelerated keyword searches.
