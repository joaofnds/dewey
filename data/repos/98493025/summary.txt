`lolgopher` is a Go implementation of a rainbow text writer, mirroring the functionality of the `lolcat` utility. This command-line application leverages the Go programming language and is designed for developers seeking to add colorful text output to their terminal applications. It is packaged using Go's dependency management tool (`dep`). This project provides a standalone CLI tool for developers.
