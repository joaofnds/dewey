This repository provides a reference implementation of a RESTful backend API built with Elixir and the Phoenix framework, demonstrating production-ready web application patterns for the blogging/social media domain. It implements the RealWorld specification for "Conduit," a Medium-clone platform, showcasing essential backend functionalities including user authentication, CRUD operations for articles and comments, user following/unfollowing, article favoriting, and pagination. The codebase serves as an educational resource for Elixir/Phoenix developers, illustrating best practices for database integration with PostgreSQL via Ecto ORM, API design, routing, and code organization while adhering to Elixir community standards enforced by Credo. Target users are backend developers learning functional programming paradigms in web development or seeking to understand how to structure scalable Phoenix applications for content management and social interaction features.
