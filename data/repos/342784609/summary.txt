lsp_signature.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides real-time function signature hints during code editing by integrating with Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients. Targeting software developers across multiple programming languages including Go, Lua, and others, it displays function parameters, documentation, and type information as floating windows or virtual text while typing function calls. The plugin addresses the limitation of completion frameworks that lack signature help functionality, offering asynchronous LSP buffer requests, parameter highlighting, multiple signature support for overloaded functions, and customizable display modes. It integrates with popular Neovim package managers like Packer and Lazy.nvim, enhancing the development experience by providing contextual code assistance without interrupting the coding workflow for developers using LSP-enabled editors.
