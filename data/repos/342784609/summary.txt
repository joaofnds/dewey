`lsp_signature.nvim` is a Neovim plugin providing real-time function signature hints within the editor as the user types, enhancing developer productivity. Written in Lua, it leverages the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to retrieve and display function signatures, supporting features like virtual text hints for parameter highlighting and floating window display of signatures, including overload variations. The plugin integrates with Neovim's LSP client and completion plugins, supporting installation via package managers like `dein`, `plug`, `packer`, and `lazy.nvim`, and offers configuration options for keymaps, borders, and visual presentation to customize the signature hints' behavior. It is specifically tailored for developers using Neovim for coding.
