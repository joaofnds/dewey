Eva Icons is an open-source icon library providing 480+ SVG icons for web and mobile development, implemented in TypeScript with JavaScript API integration. The library targets frontend developers and UI/UX designers working on web applications, iOS, and Android projects. It offers programmatic icon replacement through DOM manipulation using `data-eva` attributes, supports web font integration, and provides four CSS animation types (zoom, pulse, shake, flip). The package includes multiple distribution formats (SVG, PNG, Sketch files, web fonts) and can be consumed via CDN, NPM, or direct download. The core functionality centers on runtime SVG injection and styling through a lightweight JavaScript API, solving the common web development need for consistent, customizable iconography across digital products.
