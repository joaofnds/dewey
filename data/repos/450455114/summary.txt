Globstar is a Go-based static analysis toolkit designed for software security and code quality engineering. It enables developers and security engineers to create custom SAST (Static Application Security Testing) checkers using tree-sitter's AST parsing capabilities and S-expression query language. The tool targets the DevSecOps domain, providing both YAML-based configuration for simple pattern matching and Go API access for complex multi-file analysis with import/scope resolution. Globstar addresses the need for fast, portable static analysis in CI/CD pipelines by distributing as a single binary with no external dependencies. It supports detection of security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and compliance violations across multiple programming languages, making it suitable for security teams, DevOps engineers, and development teams implementing automated code review processes.
