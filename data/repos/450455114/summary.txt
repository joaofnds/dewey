**Globstar** is an open-source static analysis toolkit written in Go for performing code quality and security checks across various programming languages. Leveraging the power of [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) for AST-based analysis, Globstar allows developers to write custom checkers using its intuitive interface, either through a YAML interface for simple checks or a Go interface for more sophisticated ones. With lightning-fast performance, native tree-sitter support, and CI-friendly design, Globstar is an essential tool for maintaining high code quality in large codebases. This library is distributed under the MIT license, ensuring its long-term availability and community involvement.
