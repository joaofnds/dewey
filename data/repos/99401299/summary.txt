`nanoid` is a JavaScript library providing a tiny, secure, URL-friendly, and unique string ID generator. It enables the generation of random, collision-resistant IDs, offering features such as a larger alphabet for shorter IDs, and integration with hardware random number generators for security.  The library includes APIs for custom alphabets and sizes, as well as non-secure ID generation, making it suitable for various contexts, including React, React Native, and use within a command-line interface (CLI).  `nanoid` is designed as a developer productivity tool and library, aiming to simplify unique ID creation in JavaScript projects.
