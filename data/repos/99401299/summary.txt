Nano ID is a lightweight JavaScript library for generating cryptographically secure, URL-safe unique string identifiers, serving as an optimized alternative to UUID v4 for web development applications. Built for JavaScript/Node.js environments with cross-platform browser support, it produces 21-character IDs using a 64-character alphabet (A-Za-z0-9_-) while maintaining collision resistance equivalent to UUID's 122 random bits. The library leverages hardware random number generators through Node.js crypto module and Web Crypto API, implementing uniform distribution algorithms to prevent brute-force vulnerabilities. At only 118 bytes minified, it targets frontend and backend JavaScript developers building web applications, APIs, databases, and distributed systems requiring compact, secure identifier generation without external dependencies or performance overhead.
