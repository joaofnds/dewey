This Rust repository, sirupsen/napkin-math, provides a collection of software, numbers, and techniques for estimating the performance of computer systems from first principles. The goal is to answer questions like how much storage cost should be expected for an application with 100,000 requests per second (RPS). It offers a set of benchmarked numbers for various operations such as memory read/write, network communication, hashing, serialization, and more, on an Intel Xeon E-2236 3.4GHz with 12 virtual cores. The repository encourages users to practice these techniques by subscribing to the associated newsletter for weekly problems to solve. This project is particularly useful for systems engineers seeking to estimate system performance quickly and accurately.
