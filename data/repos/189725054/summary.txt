This repository provides a comprehensive reference for back-of-the-envelope performance estimation in distributed systems and infrastructure engineering. It contains empirically-measured latency and throughput benchmarks for fundamental computing operations including memory access, disk I/O, network transfers, serialization, compression, and database queries, all tested on Intel Xeon hardware. The project targets site reliability engineers, backend developers, and system architects who need to quickly estimate system performance characteristics during capacity planning, architecture design, and troubleshooting. While implemented in Rust, the core value lies in the curated performance data tables and estimation techniques rather than code functionality. It addresses the critical need for rapid performance modeling in distributed systems design, enabling engineers to make informed decisions about scalability, cost estimation, and architectural trade-offs without requiring detailed benchmarking or complex modeling tools.
