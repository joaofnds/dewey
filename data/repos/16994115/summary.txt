CanCanCan is a Ruby authorization library specifically designed for Ruby on Rails applications that provides role-based access control and permission management. It targets web developers building Rails applications who need to implement fine-grained user authorization beyond basic authentication. The library centralizes permission logic through Ability classes where developers define rules using a DSL, eliminating the need to scatter authorization checks across controllers, views, and database queries. Key features include automatic resource loading and authorization in controllers via `load_and_authorize_resource`, database-level filtering through `accessible_by` queries, and view helpers like `can?` and `cannot?` for conditional rendering. The gem integrates seamlessly with Rails' MVC architecture and ActiveRecord ORM, solving the common web development challenge of managing complex user permissions while maintaining clean, maintainable code separation.
