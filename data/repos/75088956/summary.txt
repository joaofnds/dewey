`graphql-voyager` is a TypeScript-based, interactive graph visualization tool for GraphQL APIs. It allows users to represent any GraphQL API schema as an interactive graph, facilitating API exploration and data model understanding. The tool provides features like quick navigation, detailed type information, options to simplify the graph (e.g., skip Relay wrappers), and the ability to connect to custom GraphQL endpoints. `graphql-voyager` offers pre-bundled versions and middleware integrations for popular frameworks like Express, Hapi, and Koa, making it easy to integrate within existing GraphQL-based projects; it is primarily a developer productivity tool and a web application.
