GraphQL Voyager is a TypeScript-based visualization tool that renders GraphQL APIs as interactive graphs for web developers and API designers. Built with React and GraphViz technologies, it consumes GraphQL introspection queries to generate visual representations of schema relationships, types, and fields. The tool addresses the challenge of understanding complex GraphQL schema structures by providing an interactive browser-based interface with features like Relay wrapper filtering, deprecated field handling, and configurable root type selection. It integrates with popular web frameworks (Express, Hapi, Koa) through middleware and supports both standalone deployment and npm package integration, primarily serving GraphQL developers who need to visualize, document, and communicate API schema designs effectively.
