The google/uuid repository is a Go package that generates and validates Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) conforming to RFC 9562 and DCE 1.1 Authentication and Security Services standards. Targeting backend developers, distributed systems engineers, and database architects across web development, microservices, and enterprise software domains, this library provides UUID generation for unique record identification, session management, API request tracking, and distributed system coordination. The package implements UUID as a 16-byte array rather than byte slices, offering improved performance and type safety compared to predecessor implementations. It serves developers building scalable applications requiring guaranteed unique identifiers across distributed environments, databases, and concurrent systems where collision-free identification is critical for data integrity and system reliability.
