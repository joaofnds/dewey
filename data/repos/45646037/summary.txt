Plotly.js is a standalone JavaScript data visualization library that serves as the core rendering engine for interactive charts and graphs in web applications, scientific computing, and data analysis platforms. Built on D3.js, WebGL (via regl), and SVG technologies, it provides programmatic APIs for creating statistical charts, 3D visualizations, scientific plots, financial charts, and geospatial maps directly in web browsers. The library powers the Python Plotly.py and R Plotly.R ecosystems while also serving as the visualization foundation for Dash web applications. Target users include web developers, data scientists, and frontend engineers who need to embed interactive, publication-quality visualizations in JavaScript applications, dashboards, or data analysis workflows without requiring extensive graphics programming knowledge.
