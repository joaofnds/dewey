Zed is a high-performance, multiplayer code editor built in Rust, targeting software developers across various programming domains. Developed by the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter, it leverages the GPUI framework for native GUI rendering and emphasizes real-time collaborative editing capabilities. The editor addresses performance bottlenecks commonly found in Electron-based editors by utilizing Rust's memory safety and speed advantages. Currently supporting macOS and Linux platforms, Zed integrates Tree-sitter for advanced syntax highlighting and code parsing. The project solves the core problem of providing a fast, native code editing experience with seamless multiplayer collaboration features, appealing to developers who require both high performance and team-based coding workflows without the overhead of web-based editor architectures.
