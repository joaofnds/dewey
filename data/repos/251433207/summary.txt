`vim_cubed` is a standalone, command-line application that renders the Vim text editor on a three-dimensional cube. It utilizes the Nim programming language and relies on the `paravim` library, which incorporates a built-in copy of Vim. Users can launch `vim3` to edit files, provided that the necessary Nim and OpenGL dependencies are installed. The project aims to provide a novel, albeit unusual, method of interacting with the Vim editor across various operating systems, leveraging Nim's capabilities to create a terminal-based application.
