vim_cubed is a novelty text editor that renders the Vim interface on a 3D rotating cube using OpenGL graphics, implemented in the Nim programming language. Built on top of paravim (a standalone Vim implementation), it provides a fully functional text editing environment with traditional Vim keybindings and commands while displaying the interface across the faces of a continuously spinning 3D cube. The project targets software developers and Vim enthusiasts who appreciate unconventional development tools, serving primarily as a demonstration of 3D graphics programming rather than solving practical editing problems. It leverages OpenGL for 3D rendering, cross-platform compatibility, and integrates a complete Vim engine without requiring a separate Vim installation, making it accessible across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
