**rf** is an experimental Go-based refactoring tool designed for automated code transformation and restructuring of Go codebases. Targeting Go developers and software engineering teams, it addresses the challenge of safely modifying large-scale Go applications through programmatic refactoring operations. The tool likely leverages Go's AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing capabilities and the `go/ast`, `go/parser`, and `go/format` packages to analyze, transform, and rewrite Go source code while preserving semantic correctness. As a developer tooling solution in the software development domain, rf aims to automate repetitive code changes, enable large-scale codebase migrations, and reduce manual refactoring errors that commonly occur during Go application maintenance and evolution.
