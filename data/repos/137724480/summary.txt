Hasura GraphQL Engine is an open-source GraphQL server that automatically generates real-time GraphQL APIs from existing databases, targeting backend developers and API architects in web application development. Built primarily in Haskell with TypeScript components, it connects to multiple data sources including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ClickHouse, BigQuery, and SQL Server, eliminating manual API development overhead. The engine provides fine-grained access control, automatic schema generation, real-time subscriptions, and database event webhooks, solving the problem of building and maintaining REST/GraphQL APIs for CRUD operations. Version 3 introduces a data connector architecture with SDK support for TypeScript, Python, and Go, while Version 2 remains the stable release, both designed for full-stack developers seeking rapid API development and database-to-API automation.
