GitDiagram is a web-based repository visualization tool that automatically generates interactive system architecture diagrams from GitHub repositories using AI-powered analysis. Built with Next.js/TypeScript frontend and FastAPI/Python backend, it leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 mini to analyze repository file structures and README content, then outputs Mermaid.js diagrams with clickable components linking to source files. The application targets software developers and open-source contributors who need to quickly understand large, unfamiliar codebases without manual exploration. It supports both public and private repositories via GitHub API integration, stores metadata in PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, and deploys on Vercel/EC2 infrastructure, solving the common developer problem of navigating complex repository structures for contribution or learning purposes.
