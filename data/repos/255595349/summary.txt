Org Roam BibTeX (ORB) is an Emacs Lisp extension that integrates Org-roam's note-taking system with bibliography management tools for academic research workflows. It bridges Org-roam with citation management software including Org-ref, Helm/Ivy-bibtex, and Citar, enabling researchers to create and access bibliographical notes stored in org-roam-directory through unified interfaces. The package allows users to manage academic references using BibTeX format while leveraging Org-roam's networked note-taking capabilities, supporting both Org-ref citation links and Org-cite citations. Built for academic researchers, graduate students, and knowledge workers who use Emacs for research, ORB solves the problem of fragmenting bibliographic references from contextual notes by providing seamless integration between citation databases and interconnected note systems within the Org-mode ecosystem.
