Org Roam BibTeX (ORB) is an Emacs Lisp package that extends Org Roam, enabling integrated bibliography and citation management for users of the Org-mode note-taking system. It facilitates linking notes within Org Roam to bibliography entries managed by tools like Org Ref, Helm BibTeX, and Citar, enabling users to access notes via these tools. ORB integrates with BibTeX files, allowing users to manage bibliographical notes and create cite-links and citations within Org-mode files. It functions primarily as an Emacs package or extension aimed at researchers and knowledge workers leveraging Org-mode for note-taking and bibliographic organization.
