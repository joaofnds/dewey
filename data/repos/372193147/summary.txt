git-cliff is a Rust-based changelog generator designed for DevOps and software development workflows that automatically creates structured changelog files from Git commit history. It targets developers and release engineers working with continuous integration/deployment pipelines who need to maintain consistent project documentation. The tool parses conventional commits and custom regex patterns to extract commit metadata, then applies configurable Handlebars templates to generate changelogs in various formats (Markdown, JSON, etc.). It integrates with semantic versioning (semver) practices and supports monorepo architectures, solving the manual effort required for release documentation. The core problem addressed is automating the tedious process of maintaining accurate, well-formatted changelogs that follow industry standards like Keep a Changelog and Conventional Commits specifications for professional software projects.
