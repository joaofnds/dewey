`calcurse` is a text-based calendar and scheduling application designed for managing appointments and tasks via a command-line interface. Written in C, the application provides functionality for scheduling events, managing to-do lists, and viewing calendar information. It is a standalone command-line application, offering features for both personal and potentially collaborative scheduling through features like CalDAV synchronization, as indicated by a contrib directory including a CalDAV script. The project is actively maintained and includes build system files, detailed documentation, and translation support.
