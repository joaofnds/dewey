calcurse is a text-based calendar and scheduling application written in C, designed for command-line environments and terminal-based productivity workflows. Built using ncurses for terminal user interface rendering and supporting internationalization through gettext, it targets system administrators, developers, and power users who prefer lightweight, keyboard-driven tools over graphical calendar applications. The application addresses personal information management (PIM) needs by providing appointment scheduling, task management, and calendar functionality without requiring a desktop environment or GUI framework. It includes CalDAV synchronization capabilities for integration with modern calendar services, automated build processes with autotools, and comprehensive localization support, making it suitable for server environments, minimal Linux distributions, and users seeking efficient terminal-based time management solutions within the productivity software domain.
