Lapce is a high-performance code editor written in Rust targeting software developers across all programming domains. Built on the Floem UI framework with wgpu-based GPU rendering and Xi-Editor's rope data structures for efficient text manipulation, it provides native Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration for intelligent code completion, diagnostics, and refactoring. The editor features modal editing with Vim keybindings, built-in terminal emulation, and remote development capabilities similar to VS Code Remote. It supports WASI-compatible plugins (C, Rust, AssemblyScript) and includes integrated development tools for modern software engineering workflows. Lapce addresses the need for a fast, extensible code editor that combines traditional text editing performance with contemporary IDE features for professional developers working in local and remote environments.
