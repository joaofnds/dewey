Repomix is a TypeScript-based CLI tool and web service designed for AI-assisted software development workflows. It aggregates entire codebases into single, AI-friendly files (XML, Markdown, or Plain Text) optimized for Large Language Model consumption, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other LLMs. The tool addresses token limit constraints by providing accurate token counting, optional code compression using Tree-sitter parsing, and intelligent file filtering with Git-aware exclusions. Built on Node.js, it features security scanning via Secretlint, supports remote GitHub repository processing, and offers multiple deployment options including npm package, Docker container, browser extension, and VSCode extension. Primarily targets software developers and AI engineers who need to efficiently feed large codebases to generative AI tools for code review, refactoring, and development assistance.
