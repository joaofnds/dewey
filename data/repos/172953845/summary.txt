code-server is a TypeScript-based application that runs Visual Studio Code in web browsers, enabling remote development environments accessible from any device. Built as a browser IDE, it addresses the core problem of providing consistent development environments across different machines and locations, particularly for distributed teams and cloud-based workflows. The solution targets software developers, DevOps engineers, and development teams who need remote access to their coding environment, whether for leveraging cloud compute resources, maintaining consistent tooling across devices, or enabling remote work scenarios. It implements VS Code's full feature set through web technologies, supporting the complete development workflow including debugging, extensions, and terminal access, while running on Linux servers with WebSocket support for real-time browser-server communication.
