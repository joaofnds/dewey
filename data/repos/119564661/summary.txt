intel-undervolt is a Linux system administration tool written in C that enables undervolting and thermal management of Intel CPUs from Haswell generation onwards. It targets system administrators, power users, and performance enthusiasts who need to optimize CPU power consumption, reduce heat generation, and configure thermal throttling limits on Intel-based systems. The tool directly manipulates Model-Specific Registers (MSRs) using reverse-engineered methods to adjust voltage domains, package power limits (TDP), temperature offsets (tjoffset), and Hardware-Managed P-States (HWP) preferences. It supports systemd, elogind, and OpenRC service integration for automated configuration application, includes daemon mode for persistent limit enforcement, and provides power consumption monitoring via intel_rapl kernel module, addressing thermal management challenges in laptops and servers.
