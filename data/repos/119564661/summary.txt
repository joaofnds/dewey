`intel-undervolt` is a standalone command-line tool written in C for undervolting and configuring power limits and thermal throttling settings on Intel CPUs, specifically targeting Haswell and newer architectures. The tool allows users to modify voltage domains, set package power limits (short and long term), and adjust temperature offsets, with configuration done through a dedicated configuration file (`/etc/intel-undervolt.conf`). It supports systemd, elogind, and OpenRC for service management and includes a daemon mode with features for managing energy-versus-performance preferences based on CPU load and power consumption using the `intel_rapl` module, allowing for optimized power usage scenarios.
