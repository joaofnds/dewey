`lib/pq` is a pure Go language library providing a driver for interacting with PostgreSQL databases through Go's standard `database/sql` package. It enables Go applications to connect to PostgreSQL databases and execute SQL queries, supporting features such as SSL, handling of bad connections, correct scanning of `time.Time` and binary data types, and `COPY FROM` support. The library facilitates database interaction by providing functions like `pq.ParseURL` for connection string conversion and supporting PostgreSQL-specific features including LISTEN/NOTIFY, pgpass, and GSS (Kerberos) authentication. This library is a database driver, a type of library that enables developers to connect to and interact with databases, primarily targeting Go developers building applications that require PostgreSQL database connectivity.
