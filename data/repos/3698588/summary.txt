lib/pq is a pure Go PostgreSQL database driver that implements Go's standard database/sql interface, enabling Go developers to connect to and interact with PostgreSQL databases without external C dependencies. Targeting backend web development, data processing, and enterprise application domains, it provides essential database connectivity features including SSL support, connection pooling, time/binary data type handling, COPY operations, LISTEN/NOTIFY pub-sub messaging, GSS authentication, and Unix socket connections. The driver solves the core problem of PostgreSQL integration in Go applications by offering a standard, database/sql-compatible interface with PostgreSQL-specific extensions like hstore support and libpq environment variable compatibility. Currently in maintenance mode, it primarily serves Go backend developers, data engineers, and system integrators who need reliable PostgreSQL connectivity in production applications, though active development has shifted to the pgx driver.
