Meander is a Clojure/ClojureScript library that empowers developers to write transparent data transformation code for pattern matching and substitution tasks. The primary function of this tool lies in the domain of logic programming, where it allows users to plainly see the input and output of these transformations through its `match` and `search` macros. Core features include pattern matching on a data structure, extraction of values using logic variables, and joining across values. The library also supports finding more than one answer with the `search` macro and remembering values using memory variables. This project is a library that targets developers working in the functional programming domain who require efficient data transformation capabilities.
