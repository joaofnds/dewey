Meander is a Clojure/ClojureScript library providing declarative pattern matching and term rewriting capabilities for data transformation tasks. It targets Clojure developers working on data processing, functional programming, and symbolic computation applications. The library implements logic programming concepts including unification, substitution, and term rewriting through macros like `match`, `search`, and `find` that use logic variables for extracting and joining data across complex nested structures. Key features include memory variables for collecting scattered values, conditional pattern matching with predicates, extensible syntax through `defsyntax`, and strategic rewriting with bottom-up/top-down transformation strategies. Meander solves the problem of writing clear, maintainable data transformation code by making input-output relationships explicit through pattern-based syntax, eliminating complex nested map operations and conditional logic typically required for deep data structure manipulation in functional programming contexts.
