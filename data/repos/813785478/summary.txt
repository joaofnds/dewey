SQL Studio is a cross-platform database exploration tool built in Rust that provides a unified web-based interface for querying and analyzing multiple SQL database systems including SQLite, libSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, ClickHouse, and Microsoft SQL Server. The application serves as a single-binary database client targeting database administrators, backend developers, and data analysts who need to inspect database schemas, browse table data with infinite scroll pagination, and execute ad-hoc SQL queries with IntelliSense support. It embeds a static web UI into the Rust binary and offers both local file access for SQLite databases and remote connection capabilities for server-based databases, solving the problem of needing separate tools for different database engines in development and data exploration workflows.
