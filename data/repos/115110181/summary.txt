SWC is a Rust-based compiler and toolchain designed to accelerate web development by providing fast TypeScript and JavaScript compilation. Functionality includes parsing, compiling, and transforming ECMAScript and TypeScript code, offering performance advantages compared to existing solutions like Babel. As a library, SWC integrates directly into build processes and other tools, serving primarily as a developer productivity tool for frontend and potentially full-stack developers, aiding in faster build times and improved development workflows.
