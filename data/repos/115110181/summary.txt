SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) is a high-performance JavaScript and TypeScript compiler written in Rust that serves as a faster alternative to Babel in the web development ecosystem. It provides ECMAScript parsing, transformation, and compilation capabilities for modern JavaScript/TypeScript codebases, targeting significant performance improvements over existing Node.js-based tooling. The platform offers both Rust crate libraries for systems-level integration and npm packages for JavaScript developers, supporting standard web development workflows including transpilation, bundling, and code optimization. SWC addresses the performance bottlenecks in JavaScript build toolchains by leveraging Rust's speed and memory safety, making it suitable for large-scale web applications and development teams requiring faster build times and improved developer experience.
