pnpm is a fast and disk space-efficient package manager designed for JavaScript and Node.js projects, significantly improving installation speed and reducing disk usage compared to alternatives like npm and Yarn. Written in TypeScript, it employs a content-addressable storage system to link files from a central location, optimizing dependency management and enabling efficient handling of monorepos. Key features include deterministic lockfiles, support for Node.js version management, and compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms; it functions as a command-line interface (CLI) tool for dependency installation and project management, targeted towards JavaScript developers focused on optimizing their build and development workflows.
