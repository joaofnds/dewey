pnpm is a high-performance package manager for the Node.js ecosystem, built in TypeScript to address dependency management inefficiencies in JavaScript/TypeScript projects. It serves web developers and frontend engineers by implementing a content-addressable storage system that creates hard links from a global store to node_modules, eliminating duplicate package installations and reducing disk usage. The tool provides strict dependency resolution, deterministic lockfile management (pnpm-lock.yaml), and enhanced monorepo support through workspaces functionality. Unlike npm and Yarn, pnpm enforces that packages can only access explicitly declared dependencies, preventing phantom dependency issues. It integrates with the broader Node.js toolchain while offering up to 2x faster installation speeds, making it particularly valuable for large-scale JavaScript applications, monorepos, and enterprise development workflows where build performance and disk efficiency are critical.
