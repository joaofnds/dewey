CIDER nREPL is a collection of nREPL middleware designed to enhance Clojure development environments by providing essential IDE functionality including code completion, definition lookup, namespace inspection, and debugging capabilities. Targeting Clojure developers using editors like Emacs (CIDER), Vim (fireplace.vim, vim-iced), VS Code (Calva), and Neovim (Conjure), it serves as the backend infrastructure that bridges nREPL protocol communication with rich editor features. The middleware extends the standard nREPL server with additional operations for code introspection, evaluation context management, and interactive development workflows. Built entirely in Clojure, it integrates with Leiningen and other Clojure build tools to provide a standardized API for editor-agnostic tooling, solving the problem of fragmented development tool implementations across different Clojure editors and enabling consistent REPL-driven development experiences.
