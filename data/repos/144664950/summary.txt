`NonEuclidean` is a C++ rendering engine for creating and visualizing 3D scenes with a focus on non-Euclidean geometry. It leverages OpenGL for graphics rendering, operating as a standalone application for Windows. Key functionalities include mouse-controlled camera navigation and AWSD-based movement within the 3D environment, with room switching via numerical keys and fullscreen toggling. The project depends on the GLEW library for OpenGL extensions and is designed to showcase non-Euclidean geometric principles in an interactive, visual format.
