NonEuclidean is a specialized 3D rendering engine written in C++ and OpenGL that implements non-Euclidean geometry visualization for interactive 3D scenes. Targeting computer graphics developers, game developers, and researchers in computational geometry, this engine renders spaces where traditional Euclidean geometric rules don't apply, such as rooms with impossible spatial relationships or curved spacetime effects. The engine uses OpenGL for hardware-accelerated rendering and GLEW for OpenGL extension management, providing real-time navigation through geometrically impossible environments with standard FPS controls. It serves as both a technical demonstration of advanced rendering techniques and a development framework for creating immersive experiences that challenge conventional spatial perception, particularly valuable for experimental game development and mathematical visualization applications.
