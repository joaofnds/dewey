PgSearch is a Ruby library providing ActiveRecord named scopes for leveraging PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities. It enables developers to create advanced search functionality within Rails applications, utilizing features like `tsearch`, trigram, and Double Metaphone algorithms for flexible search criteria. The library supports both single-class search scopes and a multi-search feature allowing indexing and querying across multiple Active Record models through the `multisearchable` method. Built on ActiveRecord and PostgreSQL, it integrates with the database's full-text search features, offering options for weighting, prefix searching, stemming, and ranking, making it a developer productivity tool for building robust search capabilities within Ruby on Rails applications.
