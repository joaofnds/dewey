pg_search is a Ruby gem that provides PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities for Ruby on Rails web applications through ActiveRecord integration. It enables Rails developers to implement sophisticated search functionality by creating named scopes that leverage PostgreSQL's native text search features including tsearch, trigram matching, and double metaphone phonetic search. The gem supports two primary approaches: multi-search for creating global search indexes across multiple ActiveRecord models, and search scopes for advanced single-model queries with features like association searching, result ranking, weighting, and accent-insensitive matching. Built specifically for PostgreSQL databases with ActiveRecord 7.1+ and Ruby 3.1+, it addresses the common web development need for robust search functionality without requiring external search engines like Elasticsearch, making it ideal for Rails developers building content management systems, e-commerce platforms, or any web application requiring full-text search capabilities.
