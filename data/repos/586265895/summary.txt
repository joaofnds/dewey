Kamal is a Ruby-based deployment orchestration tool designed for containerized web application deployment across distributed infrastructure. Built primarily for the DevOps and web development domain, it enables zero-downtime deployments to bare metal servers, cloud VMs, and multi-server environments using Docker containerization and SSHKit for remote command execution. The tool leverages kamal-proxy for seamless traffic switching between container instances during deployments, eliminating service interruption. Originally developed for Rails applications, Kamal supports any Docker-compatible web application stack. It targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, and web developers who need reliable, automated deployment pipelines without complex orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, focusing on simplicity while maintaining production-grade deployment capabilities across heterogeneous server environments.
