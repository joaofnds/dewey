M11 is a TypeScript-based PDP-11 assembler and emulator designed for educational purposes, specifically for computer architecture and assembly language instruction. The system implements a Macro-11 compatible assembler that parses PDP-11 assembly syntax and generates machine code, paired with a software emulator that executes the assembled instructions. Key features include comprehensive error reporting with educational feedback, detailed processor state tracking (registers, memory, PSW), instruction-level debugging capabilities, and extensible EMT (Emulator Trap) system for simulating OS calls. The emulator provides fine-grained access to execution state after each instruction and tracks all memory/register access patterns for visualization purposes. Targeting computer science educators and students learning low-level programming concepts, this browser-based tool solves the problem of accessing vintage PDP-11 hardware for hands-on assembly language education.
