`avy` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to enhance text navigation within the Emacs editor, enabling users to quickly jump to visible text elements using a character-based decision tree approach. Key functionalities include commands like `avy-goto-char`, `avy-goto-char-2`, `avy-goto-char-timer`, and variants for line and word navigation, along with integration for Org-mode headings. This project is an Emacs extension, written in Emacs Lisp, that enhances developer productivity by providing advanced text-jumping capabilities similar to `ace-jump-mode` and `vim-easymotion`.
