Avy is an Emacs Lisp package that implements a character-based decision tree navigation system for efficiently jumping to visible text locations within Emacs buffers. Targeting Emacs power users and developers who prioritize keyboard-driven workflows, it provides commands like `avy-goto-char`, `avy-goto-line`, and `avy-goto-word` that overlay single-character labels on potential jump targets, allowing users to navigate by typing the corresponding character rather than using traditional cursor movement. The package integrates with Emacs' native functionality including isearch and org-mode, solving the problem of slow cursor navigation in large files by eliminating repetitive arrow key presses or complex key combinations. It serves as an alternative to vim-easymotion for Emacs users seeking rapid intra-buffer navigation.
