This repository serves as a curated learning resource collection for Istio service mesh implementation in cloud-native microservices architectures. Targeting DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and Kubernetes administrators, it provides comprehensive documentation links, tutorials, real-world case studies, and hands-on workshops focused on Istio deployment, configuration, and operational best practices. The resource compilation covers core service mesh concepts including traffic management, security policies, observability, and integration with Envoy proxy within Kubernetes environments. It addresses the technical challenges of managing inter-service communication, implementing zero-trust security, and gaining observability in distributed microservices deployments, particularly for organizations transitioning from monolithic to cloud-native architectures using technologies like Kubernetes, Envoy, and container orchestration platforms.
