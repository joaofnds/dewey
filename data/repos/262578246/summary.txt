`askmeegs/learn-istio` is a curated resource list focused on Istio, a service mesh technology built on Envoy. The repository provides links to documentation, blog posts, videos, and examples covering Istio's core functionalities including traffic management, observability, security (mTLS, JWT), and multicluster deployments. It also explores use cases, integration with virtual machines, and extensibility via WebAssembly. This project serves as an educational hub for developers and operations teams seeking to learn about and implement Istio within microservices architectures, Kubernetes environments, and broader cloud-native ecosystems.
