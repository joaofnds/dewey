Hyper is a low-level HTTP library for Rust that provides asynchronous client and server APIs supporting HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 protocols. Targeting web development and systems programming domains, it serves as a foundational building block for higher-level HTTP frameworks like Axum and Warp, as well as HTTP clients like Reqwest. The library leverages Rust's async/await capabilities and focuses on performance, correctness, and memory safety for network programming. It addresses the need for efficient, concurrent HTTP communication in Rust applications, primarily serving systems programmers and web developers who require fine-grained control over HTTP operations rather than convenience-focused abstractions.
