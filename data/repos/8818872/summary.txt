JSON-Patch is a JavaScript implementation of RFC 6902 that enables efficient JSON document updates through delta patches rather than full document replacement. Targeting web developers and REST API implementors, it provides core functionality to apply patch operations, validate patch sequences, observe object changes to generate patches automatically, and compare objects for differences. The library supports both browser and Node.js environments with ES modules, CommonJS, and bundled distributions, offering operations like add, remove, replace, move, copy, and test on JSON structures. It solves the problem of bandwidth-efficient data synchronization in web applications by transmitting only the changes between JSON states, making it particularly valuable for real-time applications, collaborative editing systems, and optimized HTTP PATCH implementations in RESTful services.
