This repository implements a browser-based PDP-11 assembler and emulator built in JavaScript, designed specifically for computer science education and teaching computer architecture fundamentals. The system provides an interactive development environment with syntax-highlighted assembly code editing, incremental assembly with meaningful error reporting, processor state visualization, debugging capabilities including breakpoints and step-through execution, and real-time register/memory monitoring. Unlike traditional PDP-11 emulators that require operating systems, this educational tool focuses on bare-metal processor concepts, featuring octal/decimal/hexadecimal number base switching and basic console output macros for I/O simulation. It targets computer science educators and students learning low-level programming concepts, processor architecture, and assembly language fundamentals through hands-on experimentation with the elegant PDP-11 instruction set architecture.
