The `pdp11-playground` repository provides a browser-based PDP-11 assembler and emulator, designed for educational purposes, specifically to teach computer architecture and machine code concepts. It features an assembler that incrementally parses PDP-11 assembly syntax, highlights errors, and provides visual feedback on the machine's state, including register values and memory dumps. Built with JavaScript, the project offers breakpoints, supports decimal/hexadecimal representation, and emulates basic console output macros, operating as a standalone web application suitable for interactive exploration of processor behavior.
