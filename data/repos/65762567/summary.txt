Tally is a Go metrics collection library designed for high-performance applications that need to emit telemetry data to monitoring systems. It provides a buffered, hierarchical interface for collecting counters, gauges, timers, and histograms with configurable reporting intervals to reduce overhead from frequent metric emissions. The library targets DevOps and backend developers building distributed systems, microservices, and high-throughput applications who need to instrument their code for observability. Tally supports multiple reporting backends including StatsD, Prometheus, M3, and custom implementations through its StatsReporter interface, enabling integration with various monitoring and alerting infrastructures. The buffering mechanism aggregates metrics before transmission, making it suitable for applications generating high-velocity metrics without impacting performance, particularly beneficial for companies operating large-scale Go services requiring comprehensive monitoring and observability.
