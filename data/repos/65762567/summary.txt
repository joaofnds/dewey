`tally` is a Go library providing a high-performance, buffered metrics interface for collecting and reporting application telemetry. It allows developers to instrument their Go applications with counters, gauges, timers, and histograms, while decoupling metric emission velocity from the underlying reporting infrastructure. The library offers a flexible architecture with pluggable reporters, including integrations for StatsD, Prometheus, and m3, enabling users to customize their metrics pipeline.  It is designed as a developer-focused metrics library, allowing users to easily instrument their Go code and integrate with a variety of monitoring backends.
