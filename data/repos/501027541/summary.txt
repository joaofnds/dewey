Bluesky Social App is a cross-platform social media client built with React Native and TypeScript, targeting web, iOS, and Android platforms. The application implements the AT Protocol (Authenticated Transfer Protocol), a decentralized social networking protocol, using `@atproto/api` packages and `app.bsky.*` Lexicons for social media schemas. It includes a Go-based web service in `./bskyweb/` that serves the React Native Web bundle. The codebase addresses the need for a decentralized alternative to traditional social media platforms, enabling federated social networking with custom feeds and third-party integrations. Target users include mobile and web developers interested in decentralized social protocols, React Native developers, and teams building atproto-based applications.
