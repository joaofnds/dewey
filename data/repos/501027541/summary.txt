The `bluesky-social/social-app` repository hosts the source code for the Bluesky Social application, a decentralized social media client available for Web, iOS, and Android. Built using TypeScript and React Native, the application leverages the `@atproto` TypeScript packages and a Go-based web service for the web application. It provides a user interface for interacting with the AT Protocol, a decentralized social media protocol, and includes features for content creation, consumption, and social interaction. This is a standalone, cross-platform social media application aimed at users seeking an alternative social networking experience built on an open and decentralized protocol.
