`faktory_worker_ruby` is a Ruby library providing the client and worker components for interacting with the Faktory background job server. This project facilitates asynchronous job processing, enabling developers to offload tasks to be executed by worker processes. It offers an API for pushing jobs and a worker process that fetches and executes them, mirroring Sidekiq's functionality but designed to integrate with a "smart" server for advanced features and cross-language compatibility. The library is intended for Ruby developers building applications that require background job processing, particularly in polyglot environments where jobs may be handled by workers written in various programming languages.
