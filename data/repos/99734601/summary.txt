faktory_worker_ruby is the official Ruby client library and worker process for the Faktory background job processing server, serving as a polyglot alternative to Sidekiq in web application development. The gem provides job queuing capabilities for Ruby applications, allowing developers to asynchronously execute background tasks by pushing jobs to a centralized Faktory server and processing them through dedicated worker processes. It targets Ruby web developers building distributed systems who need language-agnostic background job processing, supporting Rails 7.0+ integration via ActiveJob. Unlike Redis-dependent solutions like Sidekiq, Faktory implements job retry logic, scheduling, and management features server-side, enabling organizations to use workers written in different programming languages while maintaining consistent job processing behavior across their polyglot technology stack.
