Datalevin is a simple, fast, and versatile Datalog database, designed as both an embedded database and a client-server solution, built in Clojure. It provides a Datalog query engine compatible with Datomic's flavor, incorporating a cost-based query optimizer for improved performance, competing with traditional SQL RDBMS.  Key functionalities include ACID transactions, full-text search, and vector database support through integration with the `usearch` library, along with a key-value store for EDN data.  The project presents itself as a library, a standalone server application, and a Babashka pod, targeting developers requiring a performant, durable, and flexible database solution.
