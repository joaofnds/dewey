Datalevin is a durable Datalog database engine built in Clojure that provides ACID-compliant data storage and querying capabilities across multiple deployment modes. It implements Datomic-compatible Datalog syntax with a cost-based query optimizer, backed by LMDB for high-performance storage. The system functions as an embedded database library, networked client-server database, or key-value store, supporting full-text search, vector similarity search, and native EDN data handling. Targeting Clojure developers and data engineers, it addresses the need for a simple, fast alternative to SQL databases that supports declarative querying, graph processing, and deductive reasoning without complex temporal semantics, competing directly with traditional RDBMS while maintaining familiar ACID transaction guarantees.
