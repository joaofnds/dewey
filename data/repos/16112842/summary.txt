JSON-to-Go is a JavaScript-based code generation tool that automatically converts JSON data structures into corresponding Go struct type definitions. Built for web development and Go programming workflows, it operates both as a browser-based web application and a Node.js command-line utility. The tool parses JSON input and generates idiomatic Go struct code with appropriate field tags, handling nested objects, arrays, and primitive types. It addresses the common developer pain point of manually writing Go structs for JSON unmarshaling in REST API clients, configuration parsers, and data processing applications. Targeted at Go developers and backend engineers, it streamlines the process of integrating JSON data sources into Go applications by eliminating boilerplate struct definition work.
