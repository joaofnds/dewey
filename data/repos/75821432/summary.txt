The LLVM Project provides a modular and reusable compiler infrastructure, primarily used for constructing highly optimized compilers, optimizers, and runtime environments. It features tools for intermediate representation processing, assembly, disassembly, bitcode analysis and optimization, and includes components like the Clang frontend for compiling C-like languages. Key functionalities include the generation of object files from various source languages, alongside associated libraries such as libc++ and the LLD linker. This project is a collection of tools and libraries and functions as a core infrastructure component, primarily targeting developers focused on compiler technology and systems programming.
