This is a personal dotfiles repository containing shell-based configuration management for development environment setup, primarily targeting software developers and system administrators. The repository automates the installation and configuration of core development tools including Neovim (text editor), Ghostty (terminal emulator), and Tmux (terminal multiplexer) using rcm (RCM configuration management) and Homebrew package manager on macOS/Unix systems. It provides both full machine setup through a curl-based installation script and selective configuration deployment for existing development environments. The repository solves the common problem of reproducible development environment configuration across multiple machines, enabling developers to quickly bootstrap consistent toolchains with their preferred editor settings, terminal configurations, and shell environments through version-controlled dotfile management.
