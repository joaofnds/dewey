Skaffold is a command-line tool designed for facilitating continuous Kubernetes application development, streamlining the build, push, and deployment workflow. Written in Go, it enables rapid local iteration by automatically detecting code changes and handling the build, push, and deployment phases to Kubernetes clusters, supporting policy-based image tagging. Key features include optimized source-to-deploy cycles, continuous feedback from deployed resources, project portability for sharing, and pluggable architecture for integration with various build and deploy tools. This developer-focused tool provides building blocks and configuration for CI/CD pipelines and is primarily a CLI application targeting Kubernetes developers.
