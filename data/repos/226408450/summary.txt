Neovide is a GPU-accelerated graphical user interface for Neovim, the modern Vim text editor, built in Rust using the Skia graphics library. It serves the software development and text editing domain by providing a native desktop client that enhances the terminal-based Neovim experience with hardware-accelerated rendering and graphical improvements while maintaining full compatibility with Neovim's functionality. The application targets software developers, system administrators, and power users who prefer Vim-style modal editing but want a more polished graphical interface with better performance than traditional terminal emulators. By leveraging Rust's performance characteristics and Skia's 2D graphics capabilities, Neovide addresses the need for a responsive, cross-platform Neovim GUI that doesn't compromise on the editor's core terminal-based workflows.
