Mezzano is an experimental operating system implemented entirely in Common Lisp, targeting systems programming and OS research domains. The project demonstrates alternative approaches to operating system architecture by leveraging Lisp's dynamic features, garbage collection, and interactive development environment at the kernel level. It includes a complete software stack with hardware drivers (Intel HDA audio, GMA950 graphics, USB), networking protocols (TCP/IP, DHCP), file systems (FAT32, EXT2/3/4), multicore/SMP support, and a GUI with window management. The system features advanced Lisp runtime capabilities including CLOS/MOP conformance, generational garbage collection, SSA-based compilation, and unboxed arithmetic operations. Targeting x86-64 and AArch64 architectures, it runs on VirtualBox and QEMU with plans for bare-metal deployment. Primary users include programming language researchers, systems programmers, and Lisp enthusiasts exploring unconventional operating system designs.
