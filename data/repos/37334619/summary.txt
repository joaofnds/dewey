GoMock is a mocking framework for Go programming language designed for software testing and test-driven development. It generates mock implementations of Go interfaces through two modes: source mode (parsing Go source files) and reflect mode (using runtime reflection). The framework integrates with Go's built-in testing package and provides the `mockgen` command-line tool to automatically generate mock objects from interface definitions. It enables developers to create isolated unit tests by replacing dependencies with controllable mock objects that can verify method calls, parameters, and return values. GoMock is primarily used by Go developers for backend software development, API testing, and ensuring code quality through comprehensive unit testing workflows.
