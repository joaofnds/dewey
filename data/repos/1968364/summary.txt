Xit is a native macOS Git GUI client built with Swift and Cocoa, leveraging libgit2 for Git operations. It provides developers with a visual interface for repository management, featuring commit history visualization with branch graphs, file diff previews, blame annotations, and sidebar navigation for branches, remotes, tags, and stashes. The application targets software developers working on macOS who need graphical Git repository management beyond command-line tools, offering integration with CI/CD services like TeamCity and Git hosting platforms such as Bitbucket Server. It handles large repositories efficiently and includes search functionality for commits by author, message, or hash, positioning itself as a GitX alternative with improved codebase architecture and comprehensive unit testing for the macOS development ecosystem.
