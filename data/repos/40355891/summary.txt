`to-regex-range` is a JavaScript library that generates regular expression source strings for matching numerical ranges, designed for use in validating numbers and related data. Its core functionality involves converting two numerical inputs (min and max) into a regex-compatible string optimized for performance and accuracy, as validated by extensive test assertions. This developer-focused library, built in JavaScript and compatible with Node.js environments, provides options for features like capturing groups, regex shorthands, and handling of zero-padding to generate precise and flexible regex patterns.
