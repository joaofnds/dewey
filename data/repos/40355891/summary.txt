The `to-regex-range` library is a JavaScript utility that generates optimized regular expression patterns for matching numeric ranges. Designed for Node.js and web development environments, it converts two input numbers into regex-compatible source strings that can validate ranges like postal codes, user IDs, years, or any bounded numeric sequences. The library addresses the complexity of manually crafting regex patterns for number ranges, which becomes exponentially difficult as ranges grow (e.g., matching 1-555 requires intricate character class combinations). It features performance optimization through fragment caching, quantifier reduction, and smart conditional handling for positive/negative numbers. Extensively tested with over 2.78 million assertions, it supports options for zero-padding, shorthand notation, and capture groups. The tool primarily serves JavaScript developers building form validation, data processing pipelines, or any application requiring precise numeric range matching through regular expressions.
