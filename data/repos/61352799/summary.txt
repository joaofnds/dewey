This deprecated repository provides Docker images for deploying and running the Confluent Platform, specifically for versions 5.3.x and lower. Built using Python, it leverages Docker for containerization, enabling users to quickly set up and manage Confluent Platform components. The project includes build scripts using `make` and integrates with Docker Hub for image distribution, focusing on simplifying the deployment of Kafka-related services and addressing networking considerations within the Docker environment. This is a collection of Docker image definitions (configuration files and scripts) designed to build Docker images; it is not a library or application.
