This repository contains deprecated Docker images for deploying Confluent Platform versions 5.3.x and earlier, serving the Apache Kafka ecosystem and event streaming infrastructure domain. Built with Python automation scripts and Docker containerization, it provided pre-configured images for Kafka brokers, Schema Registry, Kafka Connect, Control Center, and other Confluent Platform components. The repository addressed the operational challenge of packaging and deploying complex distributed streaming systems by providing standardized Docker containers with proper networking configurations for both development and production environments. Targeted at DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and data engineers working with real-time data pipelines, the images simplified the deployment of Kafka clusters and related services, though functionality has been migrated to component-specific repositories for versions 5.4.0+.
