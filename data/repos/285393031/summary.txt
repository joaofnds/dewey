Paru is a Rust-based AUR (Arch User Repository) helper that serves as a pacman wrapper for Arch Linux systems, targeting Linux system administrators and Arch Linux users. It automates the process of building, installing, and managing packages from the AUR by handling PKGBUILD downloads, dependency resolution, and package compilation through makepkg integration. The tool addresses the complexity of manually managing AUR packages by providing features like automated updates for development packages (particularly -git packages), PKGBUILD review workflows, interactive package searching, and seamless integration with pacman's interface and configuration. Paru essentially bridges the gap between Arch Linux's official package manager and the community-maintained AUR ecosystem, streamlining package management workflows for users who need access to software beyond the official repositories.
