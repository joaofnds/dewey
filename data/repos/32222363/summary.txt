Astral is a PHP-based web application built on the Laravel framework that provides organizational tools for GitHub users to manage their starred repositories. The application integrates with GitHub's OAuth API to authenticate users and fetch their starred repositories, enabling them to categorize stars using custom tags and organizational structures. Built with a modern web stack including Node.js, Yarn for dependency management, and following Laravel conventions, it addresses the limitation of GitHub's basic starring system by adding metadata and categorization capabilities. The tool targets developers and software engineers who actively use GitHub for discovering and bookmarking repositories but need enhanced organization features beyond GitHub's native functionality. It can be self-hosted or used via the hosted SaaS version.
