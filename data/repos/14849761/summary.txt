Onyx is a masterless distributed data processing platform written in pure Clojure, designed for real-time stream processing and batch computation workloads. It targets data engineering and big data domains, competing directly with Apache Storm, Flink, and Spark by providing fault-tolerant, high-performance distributed computation capabilities. The platform supports hybrid batch/streaming processing models and exposes an information model for constructing distributed workflows, with extensive plugin ecosystem including Kafka, Datomic, Redis, SQL databases, and AWS services. Primary use cases include ETL pipelines, continuous computation, event stream processing, CQRS implementations, and data ingestion/transformation tasks. The system is designed for data engineers, backend developers, and distributed systems architects who need scalable, cloud-native data processing solutions without single points of failure in JVM-based environments.
