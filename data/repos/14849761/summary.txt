Onyx is a high-performance, fault-tolerant, distributed data processing system designed for both batch and stream hybrid processing, written in Clojure. It exposes an information model for constructing distributed workflows and competes with systems like Apache Storm and Flink. Key functionalities include real-time event stream processing, CQRS, continuous computation, and data transformation, leveraging a masterless architecture suitable for cloud-scale deployments. The project is a framework with supporting plugins and libraries, including integrations for Kafka, Datomic, Redis, and AWS SQS/S3, along with example and template projects, enabling its use as a foundation for complex data pipelines.
