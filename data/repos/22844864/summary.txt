Synapse is a Python-based homeserver implementation for the Matrix protocol, enabling decentralized communication and real-time collaboration. The project provides the core functionality for a Matrix server, facilitating secure messaging, voice and video calls, and file sharing. Built with Python and the Twisted framework, it forms a standalone application that acts as a central hub for Matrix users, enabling federated communication across different homeservers. It targets system administrators and developers interested in deploying and managing Matrix infrastructure.
