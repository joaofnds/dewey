`slog-multi` is a Go library designed to extend and manage structured logging workflows based on Go's standard `slog` package, enabling functionalities such as handler chaining, fanout, routing, failover, and load balancing for logging records. It allows developers to construct pipelines and middlewares for log processing, supporting features like error recovery and privacy-focused record modification. Built in Go, the library offers flexible integration with various `slog` handlers and middlewares, including those for popular logging backends like Datadog and Kafka, along with HTTP framework middleware integrations. This is a library intended for developers who need advanced control over structured logging in Go applications.
