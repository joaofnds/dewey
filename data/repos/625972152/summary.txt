slog-multi is a Go library that extends Go's structured logging framework (slog) with advanced handler orchestration patterns for enterprise logging workflows. It provides fanout distribution to multiple handlers in parallel, pipeline-based log record transformation, conditional routing, failover mechanisms, and load balancing across handler pools. The library targets backend developers and DevOps engineers building distributed systems who need sophisticated logging strategies beyond basic console or file output. It integrates with existing slog handlers for various destinations (Datadog, Loki, Slack, Kafka) and supports middleware patterns for log preprocessing. The library addresses complex logging requirements in microservices architectures where logs need conditional routing, transformation for privacy compliance, or high-availability patterns with automatic failover between logging backends.
