This repository serves as a proof-of-concept collection for Go web application development, demonstrating hexagonal architecture implementation with comprehensive dependency injection patterns. Built primarily for backend web development, it showcases integration of multiple communication protocols including HTTP (via Fiber framework), gRPC services, and Kafka message streaming. The codebase emphasizes clean architecture principles using FX dependency injection container to resolve interface-to-implementation mappings, Protocol Buffers for service definitions managed by Buf, and Viper for configuration management. Integration tests cover producer-consumer patterns and cross-protocol communication scenarios. Targeted at Go developers and software architects, this repository addresses the challenge of building maintainable, testable web services with proper separation of concerns between domain logic and external adapters through ports-and-adapters pattern implementation.
