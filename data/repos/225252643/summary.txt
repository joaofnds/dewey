This repository implements a simplified Jira clone designed as a showcase project for modern React development practices. Built for web development education and demonstration purposes, it features a full-stack architecture with a React frontend using functional components and hooks, and a Node.js/TypeScript backend with TypeORM for PostgreSQL database management. The application demonstrates real-world complexity including custom UI components (datepickers, modals, forms), local state management without external libraries, custom Webpack configuration, and end-to-end testing with Cypress. Targeted at React developers of all skill levels, it serves as a learning resource for understanding scalable project structure, modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns, and full-stack web application development without relying on create-react-app or similar scaffolding tools.
