Solid is a decentralized web architecture project that provides standards and tools for building distributed web applications using Linked Data principles and semantic web technologies. Targeting web developers and decentralization advocates, it implements protocols for personal data ownership where users control their data through personal online datastores (pods) rather than centralized platforms. The project leverages RDF (Resource Description Framework), HTTP-based APIs, and web standards to enable interoperable applications that can access user data across different services with proper authentication and authorization. Solid addresses the problem of data silos and centralized control by major tech platforms, allowing developers to build applications where users maintain sovereignty over their personal information while enabling cross-platform data portability and privacy-focused web experiences through standardized decentralized protocols.
