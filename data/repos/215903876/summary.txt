nvim-colorizer.lua is a high-performance color visualization plugin for Neovim that provides real-time syntax highlighting of color codes within text editors. Written in Lua/LuaJIT for optimal performance, it targets web developers, UI/UX designers, and frontend engineers working with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files. The plugin parses and visually highlights various color formats including hex codes (#RGB, #RRGGBB, #RRGGBBAA), CSS color names, and CSS functions (rgb(), rgba(), hsl(), hsla()) by setting foreground or background colors directly in the editor buffer. It leverages Neovim's Lua API and terminal true color support, eliminating external dependencies while providing zero-latency color preview functionality. The tool addresses the common developer need to visualize colors while coding, replacing slower synchronous colorizers with a performant, real-time solution for modern text-based development workflows.
