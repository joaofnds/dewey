Linkerd 2.x is an ultralight service mesh platform designed for Kubernetes environments, providing critical security, observability, and reliability features for containerized microservices without requiring application code changes. Built primarily in Go with Rust components for the data plane proxy, it targets the cloud-native DevOps and platform engineering domain. The system addresses service-to-service communication challenges in distributed Kubernetes applications by implementing transparent network-level features including mutual TLS, traffic routing, load balancing, and telemetry collection. It serves system administrators, platform engineers, and DevOps teams managing complex microservices architectures who need zero-trust security, traffic management, and observability capabilities. As a CNCF project, Linkerd integrates deeply with the Kubernetes API and ecosystem, offering a lightweight alternative to more complex service mesh solutions while maintaining enterprise-grade security and operational visibility.
