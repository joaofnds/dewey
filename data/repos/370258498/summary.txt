`rougier/svg-lib` is an Emacs Lisp library providing functionalities for generating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) content. It enables users to create SVG tags, icons, and bars directly within the Emacs environment. The library is built entirely in Emacs Lisp, suggesting its tight integration with the Emacs text editor ecosystem. This project functions as a developer productivity tool, allowing for SVG manipulation within the editor.
