svg-lib is an Emacs Lisp library that programmatically generates and renders SVG graphics within Emacs text buffers for enhanced visual documentation and UI elements. Targeting Emacs power users, developers, and technical writers, it creates pixel-perfect tags, icons, progress indicators, buttons, and date displays that align precisely with character grids to maintain text formatting integrity. The library integrates with multiple open-source icon collections (Material Design, Bootstrap, Octicons, Simple Icons) through remote fetching and local caching mechanisms. It solves the problem of creating visually appealing, consistently-sized graphical elements in plain-text environments like org-mode documents, code comments, and technical documentation, enabling rich visual markup without breaking Emacs' text-based workflow paradigm.
