Envoy is a high-performance C++ proxy server designed for cloud-native microservices architectures, serving as an edge, middle, or service proxy in distributed systems. Hosted by the CNCF, it targets DevOps engineers, platform architects, and SREs managing containerized, dynamically-scheduled microservices environments. The proxy implements advanced networking capabilities including load balancing, service discovery, health checking, observability, and traffic management through a universal data plane API. Envoy solves the complex networking challenges inherent in microservices communication, providing features like circuit breaking, retries, timeouts, and comprehensive metrics collection. It integrates with service mesh architectures and Kubernetes environments, offering hot restart capabilities and extensive configurability for managing inter-service communication in production-scale distributed systems.
