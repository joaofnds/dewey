ip2region is an offline IP geolocation library and data management framework designed for high-performance IP address lookup and location resolution. Built primarily in Go with multi-language bindings (Java, PHP, Python, C, Rust, Lua, C#, etc.), it uses a custom XDB binary format to achieve microsecond-level query performance while supporting billions of IP data segments. The framework targets backend developers, network administrators, and web application developers who need fast, offline IP-to-location mapping without external API dependencies. It provides configurable memory acceleration through vector index caching (512KiB) or full file caching, supports custom region data formats beyond standard country/region/province/city/ISP fields, and includes both data generation tools and query clients across multiple programming languages for integration into web services, analytics platforms, and network monitoring systems.
