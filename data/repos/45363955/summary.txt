`ip2region` is an offline IP address manager and locator library providing fast IP to region mapping. Its core functionality centers around a high-performance, ten-microsecond-level search engine (xdb) designed to handle billions of IP address segments. Implemented in Go, with bindings/ports for various languages including C, Java, PHP, Lua, and Rust, this library is intended for applications needing efficient IP location lookups without external network dependencies. This project functions as a library, facilitating rapid IP address geolocation within software systems.
