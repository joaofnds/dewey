ClayGL is a modular WebGL-based 3D graphics library designed for building scalable web applications with advanced rendering capabilities. Targeting web developers creating data visualizations, interactive 3D experiences, and WebGL applications, it provides a comprehensive scene graph system with support for physically-based rendering, HDR pipelines, shadow mapping, and glTF model loading. The library features tree-shaking optimization allowing minimal bundles as small as 22k gzipped, while offering full-featured capabilities including geometry processing, GPU-based skinning, post-processing effects, and VR/stereo rendering. Notable implementations include ECharts GL for 3D data visualization and various interactive 3D viewers, making it particularly suitable for developers building web-based 3D visualization tools, interactive graphics applications, and data-driven 3D experiences using modern JavaScript and WebGL technologies.
