ClayGL is a JavaScript library designed for constructing scalable Web3D applications leveraging WebGL. Its core functionality includes scene graph management for lights, meshes, cameras, and shaders, supporting primitive geometry generation, and offering features like Phong and Lambert shaders with normal and environment map support. The library provides a glTF loader, timeline-based animation with spline interpolation, and also includes a FBX to glTF2.0 converter. As a WebGL graphics library, it enables 3D visualization and targets frontend developers building interactive web-based 3D experiences.
