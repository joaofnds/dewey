`bat` is a command-line tool written in Rust designed to be a drop-in replacement for `cat`, enhancing file viewing with syntax highlighting and Git integration. It supports a wide array of programming and markup languages, leverages `syntect` for syntax definition, and displays Git modifications directly within the terminal output. Functionality includes automatic paging, non-printable character display, and integration with tools like `fzf`, `find`, `ripgrep`, and `tail -f`. As a standalone CLI application, its architecture emphasizes customization through themes, file type associations, and pager selection, targeting developers and system administrators seeking a more feature-rich file display utility.
