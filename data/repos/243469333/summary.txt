erlfmt is an opinionated automated code formatter for Erlang developed by WhatsApp, targeting Erlang/Elixir developers and teams working in telecommunications, distributed systems, and backend infrastructure domains. Built as both a rebar3 plugin and standalone escript, it enforces consistent code formatting across .erl, .hrl, .app, .config, and .escript files by parsing Erlang AST and re-printing code while preserving semantics. The formatter addresses code readability and team collaboration issues by eliminating formatting debates, supporting line-length enforcement, comment preservation, macro handling, and manual intervention capabilities. It integrates with development workflows through CI/CD pipelines, Visual Studio Code, Emacs, and rebar3 build systems, requiring Erlang/OTP 21+ and following idempotent formatting principles to maintain AST equivalence between input and output code.
