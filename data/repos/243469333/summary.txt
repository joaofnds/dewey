`erlfmt` is an automated code formatter designed specifically for Erlang, aimed at improving code readability and team collaboration by enforcing a consistent style. The core functionality involves parsing and re-printing Erlang code while respecting original formatting decisions and enforcing a configurable line length. As a developer productivity tool, `erlfmt` is implemented as a rebar3 plugin and an escript, offering command-line access and Visual Studio Code integration, and it aims to minimize configuration through opinionated formatting choices. This project targets Erlang developers seeking to automate code formatting and maintain a standardized codebase.
