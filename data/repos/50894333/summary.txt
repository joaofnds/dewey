This repository provides a Docker containerization of Pi-hole, a network-level DNS sinkhole that blocks advertisements and tracking domains at the infrastructure layer. Targeted at network administrators and DevOps professionals, it implements DNS filtering through blocklists to provide network-wide ad blocking without requiring client-side software installation. The solution uses Shell scripting for container orchestration and configuration management, integrating with Docker Compose for deployment automation. It includes web-based administration interfaces, supports DHCP server functionality, and handles DNS query logging and statistics. The container addresses the operational challenge of deploying and maintaining Pi-hole across diverse network environments, providing persistent storage for blocklists and configuration data while enabling scalable DNS-based content filtering for home networks, small businesses, and enterprise environments seeking centralized advertisement and malware domain blocking.
