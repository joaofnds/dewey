Sendme is a command-line file transfer tool built in Rust that leverages the iroh distributed systems framework and iroh-blobs protocol for peer-to-peer file and directory transmission over the internet. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who need reliable file sharing capabilities, it addresses network connectivity challenges through automatic NAT traversal, hole punching, and relay fallback mechanisms. The tool provides BLAKE3-verified streaming with resume functionality for interrupted transfers, uses 256-bit node IDs for location transparency, and encrypts connections via TLS. Users generate transferable tickets on the sender side and use these tickets to receive files, with the system handling temporary storage and cleanup automatically during the transfer process.
