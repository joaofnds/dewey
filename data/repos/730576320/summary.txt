`sendme` is a standalone command-line application, written in Rust, designed for sending and receiving files and directories over the internet. Built upon the `iroh` and `iroh-blobs` libraries, it facilitates secure and efficient file transfers, employing hole punching and NAT traversal techniques with a fallback relay mechanism. The application provides a simple `send` command to serve files and directories, generating a transfer ticket, and a `receive` command to download data from a given ticket, with support for resumable downloads and blake3 verified streaming. The technology stack centers around Rust, utilizing `iroh` and `iroh-blobs` for peer-to-peer communication and file transfer protocols, and TLS for encryption.
