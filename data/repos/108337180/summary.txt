RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine) is a standalone CLI application written in Go for installing and managing Kubernetes clusters. It provides a streamlined, containerized approach to Kubernetes deployment, simplifying the process of setting up and running a Kubernetes cluster. Key features include automated cluster configuration and management, running entirely within containers for portability and ease of use. This project is a developer productivity tool focusing on Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management and has been superseded by RKE2, the recommended successor.
