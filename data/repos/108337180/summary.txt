Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a containerized Kubernetes distribution and cluster provisioning tool written in Go, designed for DevOps and platform engineering teams. It simplifies Kubernetes cluster deployment by running all cluster components entirely within Docker containers, eliminating complex host-level dependencies. RKE targets system administrators and DevOps engineers who need to deploy production-ready Kubernetes clusters across diverse infrastructure environments including bare metal, VMs, and cloud platforms. The tool uses YAML-based cluster configuration files and integrates with Rancher's container management ecosystem. RKE addresses the complexity of traditional Kubernetes installation methods by providing a single binary that can bootstrap multi-node clusters with networking (CNI), ingress controllers, and persistent storage configured automatically. However, RKE has reached end-of-life status with version 1.8 being the final release.
