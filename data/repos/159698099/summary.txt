**stegify** is a Go-based CLI tool and library implementing LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography for covertly embedding arbitrary files within PNG and JPEG images. The tool addresses digital forensics, security research, and data hiding use cases by manipulating the least significant bits of image pixels to store hidden data without visually altering the carrier image. It supports both single and multi-carrier encoding/decoding operations, where data can be split across multiple images for enhanced security and capacity. Built with Go's standard image processing libraries, stegify serves cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and researchers who require transparent data concealment capabilities. The implementation provides both programmatic API access and command-line interface for encoding hidden payloads and extracting concealed data from steganographic images.
