`stegify` is a Go-based command-line tool and library for LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography, enabling the hiding of arbitrary files within images. The tool encodes and decodes data within JPEG and PNG image formats, allowing for transparent data concealment and extraction. It supports both single and multiple carrier images for encoding and decoding operations, with a CLI interface for ease of use and a Go package for programmatic integration. The project functions as a standalone application focused on image manipulation and data security, targeting developers and security enthusiasts interested in steganographic techniques.
