`Grit` is a standalone, CLI-based personal task manager implemented in Go, employing a multitree data structure based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for task representation and management. This tool allows users to organize tasks hierarchically, enabling subtask creation, cross-linking between tasks, and time-based planning through the use of date nodes. Key features include task state management (inactive, in-progress, completed), alias support, and the ability to create root tasks for long-term projects, facilitating productivity and focused task tracking.
