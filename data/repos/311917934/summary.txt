Grit is a command-line personal task management application written in Go that implements a multitree data structure for hierarchical task organization. Built for productivity-focused users and developers, it represents tasks as nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where tasks can have multiple parent relationships, enabling complex task subdivisions and cross-linking between different task hierarchies. The system introduces date nodes following YYYY-MM-DD format to provide temporal context, automatically creating and destroying date-based root nodes as tasks are scheduled. Tasks maintain three states (inactive, in progress, completed) with automatic state propagation through parent-child relationships. The multitree structure allows users to break down complex projects into manageable subtasks while supporting both short-term daily planning and long-term project management through its graph-based architecture, making it particularly suitable for software developers and project managers who need sophisticated task dependency tracking.
