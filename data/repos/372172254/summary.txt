Axum is an ergonomic web application framework for Rust that provides HTTP server functionality built on top of Tokio's async runtime, Tower's service abstraction layer, and Hyper's HTTP implementation. Targeting backend web developers, it enables building REST APIs and web services through macro-free routing, declarative request parsing via extractors, and standardized response generation. The framework leverages Tower's middleware ecosystem for cross-cutting concerns like timeouts, tracing, compression, and authorization, allowing code reuse across Hyper and Tonic applications. Axum solves the complexity of async web service development in Rust by providing a type-safe, zero-cost abstraction layer that maintains performance comparable to raw Hyper while offering developer-friendly APIs for request handling, JSON serialization, and HTTP status management.
