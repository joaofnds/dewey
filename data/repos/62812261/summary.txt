This repository provides a comprehensive educational tutorial for manually bootstrapping a Kubernetes cluster from scratch without automation tools or scripts. Targeting the DevOps and container orchestration domain, it guides system administrators and platform engineers through the step-by-step process of setting up core Kubernetes components including etcd cluster, control plane controllers, worker nodes, TLS certificate management, and pod networking. The tutorial uses modern versions of Kubernetes v1.32.x, containerd v2.1.x, CNI v1.6.x, and etcd v3.6.x across a multi-node architecture with dedicated jumpbox, control plane, and worker nodes. Designed specifically for learning Kubernetes internals rather than production deployment, it addresses the knowledge gap between using managed Kubernetes services and understanding the underlying infrastructure components, configuration files, and security mechanisms that enable container orchestration at scale.
