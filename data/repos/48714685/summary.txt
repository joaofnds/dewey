Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a cloud-native policy engine written in Go that provides declarative authorization and compliance enforcement across distributed systems. It uses the Rego query language to define policy rules that evaluate authorization decisions, resource constraints, and compliance requirements in real-time. OPA integrates with cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes, microservices, and CI/CD pipelines through REST APIs and Go SDKs, enabling centralized policy management without hardcoding business logic into applications. The system targets DevOps engineers, platform architects, and security teams who need to implement fine-grained access control, resource governance, and regulatory compliance across multi-cloud and containerized environments, solving the problem of distributed policy enforcement in modern cloud-native architectures.
