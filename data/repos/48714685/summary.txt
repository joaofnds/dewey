Open Policy Agent (OPA) is a general-purpose policy engine, implemented in Go, designed for unified, context-aware policy enforcement across cloud-native environments. It enables declarative policy definition using the Rego language to govern aspects like authorization, compliance, and resource management. OPA integrates with services via queries, returning policy decisions based on rules and data, and supports integration with Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, and other platforms. This is a standalone policy engine, acting as an SDK and REST API, targeted towards system administrators and developers seeking to externalize and manage policies within their infrastructure.
