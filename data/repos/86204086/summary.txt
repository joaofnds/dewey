kubernetes-el is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a comprehensive interface for managing Kubernetes clusters directly within the Emacs editor. Targeting DevOps engineers, platform administrators, and developers who prefer terminal-based workflows, it serves as a "porcelain" layer over kubectl commands, offering visual cluster management capabilities including resource viewing, editing, and operational tasks. The package integrates with the Kubernetes API to display cluster state, pods, services, deployments, and other resources in interactive Emacs buffers with real-time polling and refresh capabilities. It addresses the need for IDE-integrated container orchestration management, eliminating context switching between Emacs and separate Kubernetes CLI tools, particularly valuable for infrastructure-as-code practitioners and system administrators who live primarily within Emacs environments.
