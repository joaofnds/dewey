Kite is an interactive graph theory visualization tool built entirely in Elm that enables users to create, edit, and analyze mathematical graphs through a web-based interface. Targeting mathematicians, computer science students, and researchers in discrete mathematics and combinatorics, it provides real-time graph manipulation capabilities including node/edge creation, graph algorithm visualization, and structural analysis. The application runs in web browsers (optimized for Chrome) and leverages Elm's functional programming paradigm for reliable state management and rendering. Beyond academic graph theory applications, Kite supports practical use cases such as visualizing module dependency graphs in Elm projects, making it valuable for both educational purposes in mathematics and software development workflow analysis.
