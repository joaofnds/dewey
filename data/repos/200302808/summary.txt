ViewComponent is a Ruby framework that enables Rails developers to build modular, component-based view architectures by encapsulating HTML, CSS, and presentation logic into reusable Ruby classes. Targeting web development teams working with Ruby on Rails applications, it addresses the common problem of maintaining large, complex ERB templates and partial views that become difficult to test and reuse across different parts of an application. The framework integrates directly with Rails' existing view layer, allowing developers to create object-oriented view components that can be unit tested in isolation, accept parameters like regular Ruby objects, and promote better separation of concerns in MVC architecture. This approach particularly benefits Rails developers building large-scale web applications who need maintainable, testable frontend code organization.
