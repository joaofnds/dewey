Monocraft is a Python-based project providing a monospaced programming font inspired by the Minecraft typeface. Its primary function is to offer developers an alternative font with a retro aesthetic, incorporating features like programming ligatures for improved code readability and a unique visual style. The font includes over 1500 glyphs, optimized for monospaced environments and includes specialized ligatures and support for Windows, macOS, and Linux installation. This is a standalone font package, distributed as `.ttc` files, targeting developers who appreciate the Minecraft aesthetic.
