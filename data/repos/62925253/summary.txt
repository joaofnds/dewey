m-cli is a macOS command-line administration tool written in shell scripts that provides a unified interface for managing system utilities and applications through Terminal. Targeting system administrators and power users in the macOS ecosystem, it leverages native macOS commands without external dependencies to control system functions including disk management, network configuration, audio/video settings, iTunes control, firewall management, user administration, and hardware monitoring. The tool implements a hierarchical command structure (m <command> <option>) covering 40+ system management domains such as Bluetooth, DNS, dock preferences, battery monitoring, and WiFi configuration. It solves the problem of fragmented macOS system administration by consolidating various system control operations into a single CLI interface, eliminating the need to remember disparate native commands or install third-party utilities for routine administrative tasks.
