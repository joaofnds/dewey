Ecto is a toolkit for data mapping and language-integrated query specifically designed for the Elixir programming language. It facilitates interaction with various databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite3, and ClickHouse, through adapter implementations based on `Ecto.Adapters.SQL`.  Ecto provides a means to map data from any source into Elixir structs, regardless of database backing. This library is a core component for Elixir developers building applications that require database interaction, with features like schema definition and query construction using language-integrated query capabilities. It is a library project.
