Ecto is a database toolkit and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Elixir applications, providing data mapping capabilities and language-integrated query composition. Targeting web developers and backend engineers building Elixir/Phoenix applications, it abstracts database interactions through schema definitions, migrations, and composable query syntax. The library supports multiple database adapters including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite3, and ClickHouse via dedicated adapter packages like ecto_sql and postgrex. Ecto solves the impedance mismatch between Elixir data structures and relational databases, offering both keyword-based and pipe-operator query interfaces, changesets for data validation, and repository patterns for data persistence. It serves as the de facto standard for database access in the Elixir ecosystem, particularly for web applications requiring robust data layer functionality.
