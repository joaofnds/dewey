This repository provides an educational resource explaining Git's internal architecture and design principles for version control systems. Targeting software developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who need deep understanding of Git's underlying mechanisms, it covers Git's content management model, object database structure, and distributed version control concepts. The material focuses on Git's core components including blob objects, tree structures, commit graphs, and reference management rather than user-facing commands. It serves as technical documentation for understanding how Git stores, tracks, and manages source code changes at the filesystem and data structure level, making it valuable for developers implementing Git workflows, building Git-based tools, or troubleshooting complex repository issues in software development environments.
