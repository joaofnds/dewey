Way Cooler is a Wayland compositor implementation designed to bring AwesomeWM's tiling window management capabilities to the Wayland display server protocol. Built with C and using the wlroots library as its foundation, it serves as the display server component that handles window composition, input management, and graphics rendering for Wayland-based desktop environments. The project targets Linux desktop users and system integrators seeking an alternative to X11-based window managers, specifically those familiar with AwesomeWM's Lua-configurable tiling paradigm. It requires a patched version of the Awesome client to function properly and implements custom Wayland protocols for communication between compositor and client components, addressing the need for advanced tiling window management in modern Wayland desktop environments.
