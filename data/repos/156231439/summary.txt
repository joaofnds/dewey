This Emacs Lisp package provides seamless navigation integration between Emacs windows and tmux panes, functioning as a port of vim-tmux-navigator for the Emacs ecosystem. It enables developers to treat Emacs editor windows and terminal multiplexer panes as a unified workspace, allowing directional navigation (up/down/left/right) across both environments using consistent keybindings (C-k/C-j/C-h/C-l). The package targets software developers and system administrators who use Emacs as their primary editor within tmux-based terminal workflows, solving the context-switching friction between code editing and command-line operations. It includes functionality for creating, toggling, and managing tmux panes directly from Emacs, plus hooks for customizing transition behavior, making it particularly valuable for DevOps engineers and developers who rely heavily on terminal-based development environments.
