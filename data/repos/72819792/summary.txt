`re-frame-10x` is a Clojure library providing a debugging dashboard for `re-frame` applications, a data-oriented framework for building ClojureScript user interfaces. It instruments and visualizes the internal workings of running `re-frame` apps, offering features like epoch inspection, data flow tracing, and time travel debugging, allowing developers to analyze event handlers, subscriptions, and app-db state. Its primary functions include performance analysis, debugging, and aiding in understanding and exploring `re-frame` codebases.  The project is a developer productivity tool designed as a browser-based extension, leveraging ClojureScript and specifically targeting re-frame developers.
