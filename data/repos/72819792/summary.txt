re-frame-10x is a debugging dashboard tool for ClojureScript web applications built with the re-frame reactive framework. It provides real-time instrumentation and inspection capabilities for re-frame applications by capturing and visualizing trace data generated during event processing cycles. The tool presents an epoch-oriented debugging interface that allows developers to examine data flow, subscription recalculations, and event handler execution within re-frame's unidirectional data architecture. Built using Clojure/ClojureScript and Reagent, it targets frontend web developers working with re-frame applications who need to debug complex state management, performance issues, and data flow patterns. The dashboard offers time-travel debugging, performance analysis, and detailed visualization of re-frame's internal operations to help developers understand application behavior without manual logging.
