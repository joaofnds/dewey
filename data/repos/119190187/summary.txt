Gitleaks is a Go-based command-line security tool designed for DevSecOps and CI/CD pipelines that detects hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords, and tokens in Git repositories, files, and stdin streams. Built for security engineers, DevOps teams, and developers, it integrates seamlessly into development workflows through GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, and Docker containers to prevent data loss and credential exposure. The tool uses pattern matching and entropy analysis to identify sensitive information across commit histories and source code, supporting both standalone CLI usage and automated security scanning in continuous integration environments. It addresses the critical cybersecurity problem of accidentally committed secrets in version control systems, making it essential for organizations implementing secure software development practices and compliance with data protection requirements.
