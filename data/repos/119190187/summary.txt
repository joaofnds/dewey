Gitleaks is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Go designed to identify and detect secrets, such as API keys and passwords, within Git repositories and files. It scans for secrets using regular expressions and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines and pre-commit hooks for data loss prevention (DLP) and DevSecOps practices. Key features include scanning Git repositories, directories, and standard input, with support for custom rule configuration and reporting in multiple formats like JSON and SARIF. It is a standalone application that provides a Docker image and a GitHub Action integration, making it easy to incorporate into existing workflows.  The target audience is likely developers, security engineers, and system administrators concerned with secret management and preventing sensitive data leakage in software projects.
