LuaRocks is a package management system specifically designed for the Lua programming language ecosystem, enabling developers to install, manage, and distribute Lua modules as self-contained packages called "rocks." Built entirely in Lua, it supports both LuaJIT and standard Lua implementations, providing functionality for local and remote repository management, dependency resolution, and multiple local package trees. The system addresses the critical need for standardized module distribution and dependency management in Lua development, similar to npm for Node.js or pip for Python. LuaRocks primarily serves Lua developers across various domains including embedded systems, game development, web development, and scripting automation, providing essential tooling for managing third-party libraries and maintaining reproducible development environments in Lua-based projects.
