The Deno Standard Library is a comprehensive collection of high-quality TypeScript/JavaScript APIs designed for the Deno runtime and web development ecosystem. It provides essential utilities, modules, and functionality that extend Deno's core capabilities, offering developers a reliable foundation for building server-side applications, CLI tools, and web services. The library targets JavaScript/TypeScript developers working in modern web development, focusing on solving common programming tasks with secure, performant, and well-tested modules. Distributed through JSR (JavaScript Registry), it follows semantic versioning and emphasizes code quality with comprehensive test coverage, serving as the de facto standard library for Deno-based projects and applications requiring robust, production-ready utilities.
