Monolith is a Rust-based CLI tool and library designed for web archiving and content preservation, targeting data hoarders, researchers, and developers who need to save complete web pages offline. It solves the problem of incomplete web page saving by bundling HTML documents with all their dependencies (CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts) into a single self-contained HTML5 file using data URL embedding. Unlike traditional tools like wget or browser "Save As" functionality, monolith ensures pixel-perfect offline rendering by inlining all external resources, making it ideal for digital preservation, documentation, research archiving, and creating portable web content that remains fully functional without internet connectivity. The tool serves web developers, digital archivists, and content researchers who require reliable offline access to web resources.
