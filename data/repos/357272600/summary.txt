WinBox is a lightweight JavaScript library that implements a desktop-style window manager for web browsers, enabling developers to create draggable, resizable, and stackable window interfaces within web applications. Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS without external dependencies, it provides programmatic APIs for window creation, manipulation, and event handling, supporting features like minimize/maximize, modal dialogs, and custom themes. The library targets frontend web developers building desktop-like user interfaces, dashboard applications, or multi-panel web applications that require windowed content management. WinBox solves the problem of creating native desktop window behavior in browser environments, offering an alternative to traditional modal dialogs and fixed layouts by providing a complete window management system with familiar desktop metaphors for web applications.
