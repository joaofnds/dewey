Cobra is a Go library for building modern command-line interface (CLI) applications with structured command hierarchies and POSIX-compliant flag parsing. Targeting Go developers across DevOps, system administration, and application development domains, it provides subcommand support, nested command structures, automatic help generation, shell autocompletion, and integration with the pflag library for advanced flag handling. The framework enables creation of intuitive CLI tools following the "APPNAME VERB NOUN --FLAG" pattern, widely adopted by major projects like Kubernetes, Hugo, and GitHub CLI. It includes a cobra-cli generator for rapid application scaffolding and optional integration with Viper for configuration management, solving the complexity of building professional-grade command-line interfaces with consistent user experience and comprehensive feature sets.
