This repository provides a proof-of-concept Go implementation of the OPAQUE password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol, targeting cryptography and security research domains. OPAQUE is a modern cryptographic protocol that enables secure password-based authentication without exposing passwords to servers, addressing the fundamental security problem of password storage and verification in distributed systems. The implementation includes core OPAQUE functionality for user registration and login flows, with message marshaling/unmarshaling capabilities and JSON encoding support. Built specifically for security researchers, cryptography engineers, and protocol implementers working on authentication systems, this reference implementation serves as a foundation for understanding OPAQUE's mechanics rather than production deployment, utilizing Go's cryptographic libraries to demonstrate the protocol's password-hardening and key exchange mechanisms.
