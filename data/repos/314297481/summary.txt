This repository provides a proof-of-concept implementation of the OPAQUE (Oblivious Password Authenticated Key Exchange) protocol, written in Go. It exposes functions for OPAQUE registration and login handling, including message marshaling, unmarshaling, and JSON encoding for core OPAQUE operations. This project is a library and is intended to serve as a reference implementation, showcasing the fundamental functionality of the OPAQUE protocol; it is not intended for production use.
