Endlessh is an SSH tarpit implementation written in C designed for cybersecurity defense and server hardening. It functions as a honeypot that binds to a port (typically SSH port 22) and sends an infinitely slow, randomized SSH banner to connecting clients, effectively trapping automated SSH brute-force attacks and script kiddies for hours or days. The tool operates as a single-threaded, standalone daemon using poll() for concurrent client handling without requiring cryptographic libraries since it intercepts connections during the pre-authentication banner phase. System administrators and DevSecOps professionals deploy this alongside legitimate SSH servers running on alternate ports to reduce attack surface and waste attackers' resources. The application supports IPv4/IPv6, configurable delays, client limits, and syslog integration for network security monitoring.
