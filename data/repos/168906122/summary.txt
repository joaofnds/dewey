`endlessh` is a standalone, single-threaded C application designed as an SSH tarpit. It functions by slowly sending a randomized, endless banner to SSH clients, effectively consuming their connection time and diverting malicious actors from a real SSH server. The application uses `poll()` for handling multiple client connections concurrently and offers configuration options for listening port, banner line length, delay between lines, and maximum client connections, configurable through command-line arguments and an OpenSSH-style configuration file. It targets system administrators and security professionals seeking to enhance SSH server security through deception.
