dockerfile-mode is an Emacs Lisp package that provides specialized editor support for Docker containerization workflows within the Emacs text editor. Targeted at DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers working with containerized applications, it adds syntax highlighting for Dockerfile syntax and integrates Docker build functionality directly into the editor buffer. The mode enables users to execute `docker build` commands via keyboard shortcuts (C-c C-b for normal builds, C-c M-b to bypass cache) without leaving the editor environment. It supports configurable Docker binary paths and allows embedding image names directly in Dockerfile headers using Emacs file-local variables, streamlining the container development and deployment pipeline for teams using Emacs as their primary development environment.
