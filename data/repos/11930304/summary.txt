`dockerfile-mode` is an Emacs Lisp package providing syntax highlighting and build capabilities for Dockerfiles within the Emacs text editor. It allows users to directly build Docker images from within an Emacs buffer using `C-c C-b` (or `C-c M-b` to bypass the cache). The package supports specifying the image name within the Dockerfile itself via a special comment. This project functions as an Emacs mode, enhancing developer productivity by providing a specialized editing environment for Dockerfile creation and image building.
