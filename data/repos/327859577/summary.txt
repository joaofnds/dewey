JuiceFS is a distributed POSIX-compliant file system implemented in Go that provides cloud-native storage infrastructure for big data and enterprise applications. It separates metadata storage (using Redis, MySQL, TiKV, or SQLite) from data storage (using object storage services like S3, HDFS, or local disk), enabling scalable file system operations across distributed environments. The system targets DevOps engineers, data engineers, and system administrators who need to integrate cloud object storage with existing applications requiring traditional file system semantics. JuiceFS solves the problem of efficiently accessing massive cloud storage through standard POSIX interfaces while providing Hadoop compatibility, Kubernetes CSI driver integration, and S3 gateway functionality, making it particularly valuable for big data processing, machine learning pipelines, and cloud-native application deployments that require shared, high-performance storage.
