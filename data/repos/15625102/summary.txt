GOCUI is a minimalist Go library for building terminal-based Console User Interfaces (CUIs), targeting developers who need to create interactive command-line applications and system administration tools. The package provides a widget-based GUI framework that runs entirely in the terminal, featuring overlapping views that implement io.ReadWriter interfaces, concurrent-safe runtime modifications, global and view-level keybindings, mouse support, and colored text rendering. Built specifically for the DevOps and systems programming domain, it enables developers to create sophisticated terminal applications like monitoring dashboards, configuration tools, and interactive CLI utilities without requiring external GUI dependencies. The library follows Go's minimalist design philosophy while providing essential features for building complex terminal interfaces through reusable widgets and customizable layouts.
