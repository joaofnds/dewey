Moneta is a Ruby library providing a unified interface for interacting with various key/value stores, including NoSQL and document-based databases. It offers a consistent API across numerous backends, supporting features such as configurable serialization, compression, and key transformation through proxy mechanisms similar to Rack middlewares. Key functionalities include expiration, atomic operations (increment, decrement, create), shared synchronization primitives, and integration with popular Ruby frameworks like Rails and Sinatra. This library aims to simplify key/value store usage, facilitate comparisons, and provide a common starting point for developers.
