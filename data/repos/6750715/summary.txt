Moneta is a Ruby library that provides a unified interface for key/value storage systems, abstracting away differences between various NoSQL databases, caches, and storage backends. Targeting Ruby web developers and backend engineers, it supports over 20 storage adapters including Redis, MongoDB, Memcached, SQL databases (ActiveRecord, Sequel), and filesystem stores, enabling seamless switching between storage solutions. The library implements a middleware-like proxy system for configurable serialization (Marshal, JSON, YAML), compression (Zlib, Snappy), and key transformation, while providing atomic operations, expiration support, and distributed synchronization primitives. It integrates with popular Ruby web frameworks including Rails, Rack, Sinatra, and Padrino, solving the problem of vendor lock-in and API inconsistencies across different storage technologies in Ruby applications.
