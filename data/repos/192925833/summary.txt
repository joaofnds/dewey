Prisma is a next-generation object-relational mapper (ORM) designed for Node.js and TypeScript backend applications, providing a type-safe and auto-generated query builder, data modeling, and database migration capabilities. Supporting various database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and others, Prisma facilitates database access via Prisma Client, a query API that simplifies database interactions. The project comprises tools such as Prisma Client, Migrate, and Studio, allowing developers to define application models and access data through generated TypeScript interfaces, thus enhancing developer productivity. It is a developer productivity tool in the form of a library/SDK.
