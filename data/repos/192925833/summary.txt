Prisma is a next-generation Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript applications, targeting backend web developers building database-driven applications. It provides three core components: Prisma Client (auto-generated, type-safe query builder), Prisma Migrate (declarative schema migration system), and Prisma Studio (database GUI). The toolkit supports multiple databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB, and CockroachDB. Prisma solves database access complexity by generating type-safe database clients from a declarative schema file, eliminating manual SQL writing while providing full TypeScript integration. It targets backend developers building REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, microservices, and serverless applications who need robust database abstraction with compile-time safety and developer productivity improvements.
