The `ldd3` repository provides updated example drivers for the Linux kernel, specifically addressing compatibility issues between the examples from the "Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition" book and recent kernel versions. These examples are designed to be compiled and tested against various kernel versions, including the latest Linus Torvalds kernel tree and specific builds like those used in Ubuntu, Yocto, Buildroot, and Alpine. Written in C, the project facilitates learning and experimentation with Linux device driver development, including integration with the Eclipse CDT IDE. It is a collection of example code, intended for developers and system engineers working with embedded systems or kernel development.
