This repository contains updated C implementations of the example device drivers from the "Linux Device Drivers 3" book, modernized to compile and function with recent Linux kernel versions (4.9-5.10+). Targeting kernel developers and embedded systems engineers, it addresses the compatibility issues that arise when the original LDD3 examples fail to build against modern kernel APIs due to interface changes and deprecations over time. The project maintains compatibility across multiple Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Yocto, Buildroot, and Alpine, with build system integration for cross-compilation and Eclipse CDT support for kernel source navigation. It serves as a practical learning resource for developers studying Linux kernel module development, device driver programming, and low-level system programming in embedded Linux environments.
