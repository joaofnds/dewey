Fast JSON API is a high-performance Ruby serialization library designed for web API development that converts Ruby objects into JSON:API compliant format. Developed by Netflix for Ruby on Rails applications, it provides a declarative syntax similar to Active Model Serializer while delivering 25x faster serialization performance. The library supports standard JSON:API features including compound documents, relationships (belongs_to, has_many, has_one), sparse fieldsets, caching, and key transformations. It addresses the performance bottlenecks in REST API serialization for Ruby backend developers building web services that need to efficiently transform ActiveRecord models and Ruby objects into standardized JSON responses. Though no longer maintained, it has been forked as jsonapi-serializer for continued development.
