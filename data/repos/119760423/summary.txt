`fast_jsonapi` is a Ruby library, now *not-maintained*, designed for lightning-fast JSON:API serialization of Ruby objects. It provides features akin to Active Model Serializers, including support for `belongs_to`, `has_many`, and `has_one` relationships, compound document serialization, caching, and key transforms. Users can define serializers with declarative syntax to control output, with options for conditional attributes, relationships, and sparse fieldsets. The library is intended as a developer productivity tool for building APIs, with integrations and instrumentation for Skylight.
