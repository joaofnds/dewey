Kaocha is a comprehensive test runner and testing framework for Clojure and ClojureScript applications, designed to replace traditional testing tools with enhanced functionality and extensibility. Built specifically for the Clojure ecosystem, it provides a plugin-based architecture that supports multiple testing scenarios including unit tests, ClojureScript browser testing, Cucumber BDD integration, JUnit XML reporting, and code coverage analysis through Cloverage. The framework targets Clojure developers working on JVM and JavaScript runtime environments, offering features like deep diff comparisons for test assertions, configurable test suites, and integration with build tools like Boot. Kaocha addresses the limitations of existing Clojure testing tools by providing a unified, extensible platform that can handle diverse testing requirements across full-stack Clojure development workflows, from backend services to frontend ClojureScript applications.
