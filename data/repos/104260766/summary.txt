Extrakto is a tmux plugin designed for terminal-based development workflows that enables rapid text extraction and manipulation without mouse interaction. Built in Python 3.6+ with fuzzy-finding capabilities via fzf/skim integration, it allows developers and system administrators to quickly select, copy, and insert text patterns like file paths, URLs, git hashes, and command outputs directly from terminal scrollback buffers. The tool addresses the common DevOps problem of retyping visible terminal content by providing keyboard-driven text extraction with customizable filters and clipboard integration across Linux (X11/Wayland), macOS, and WSL environments. Target users include software developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who work extensively in terminal environments and need efficient text manipulation capabilities during remote SSH sessions, command-line operations, and terminal-based development tasks.
