The `script` library is a Go package designed for system administration and DevOps automation, providing a pipeline-based API that mimics Unix shell scripting functionality. It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and Go developers who need to perform file operations, process management, and data manipulation tasks programmatically. The library implements Go equivalents of common Unix utilities like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `curl`, `find`, and `jq`, enabling chainable operations on data streams through method chaining. Key capabilities include file I/O, HTTP requests, text processing, regular expression matching, JSON manipulation, and subprocess execution. It solves the problem of writing system scripts in Go by providing shell-like ergonomics while maintaining Go's type safety and error handling, making it easier to replace bash scripts with more maintainable Go programs for infrastructure automation and data processing pipelines.
