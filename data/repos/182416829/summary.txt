`script` is a Go library designed to simplify shell-like scripting tasks within Go programs, providing a fluent API for data stream manipulation. It offers a pipeline-based architecture, mirroring shell commands, enabling functionalities such as file reading, subprocess execution, text filtering, and HTTP requests. The library supports a wide range of operations analogous to common Unix utilities like `cat`, `grep`, `sed`, `jq`, and `curl`, facilitating system administration tasks and data processing workflows. This library is a developer productivity tool, enabling Go developers to create command-line tools and scripts more efficiently.
