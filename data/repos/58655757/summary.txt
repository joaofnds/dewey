`rbspy` is a standalone, command-line application and Rust library designed as a sampling CPU profiler specifically for Ruby programs. It enables users to profile running Ruby processes without requiring restarts by collecting profiling data and saving it for later analysis. The core functionality includes recording profiling data and its subsequent analysis via various methods. Built in Rust, it targets Ruby developers and provides low-overhead profiling capabilities for production environments, with pre-built binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
