rbspy is a sampling CPU profiler for Ruby applications written in Rust, designed for production performance analysis and debugging. It targets Ruby developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who need to profile running Ruby processes without restarting them or modifying application code. The tool attaches to existing Ruby processes using system-level profiling techniques, collecting stack trace samples at regular intervals to identify performance bottlenecks with minimal overhead. Built as both a standalone cross-platform binary (Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD) and a Rust library crate, rbspy addresses the critical need for non-intrusive runtime profiling in Ruby web applications, background jobs, and command-line tools, enabling developers to optimize application performance in production environments where traditional profiling methods are impractical.
