Tcell is a Go library providing a cell-based interface for text terminals, offering an alternative to termbox with improved features. It enables the creation of terminal-based applications, including support for Unicode, enhanced color handling (including 24-bit color), improved mouse support, and bracketed paste. Designed to be portable across POSIX and Windows platforms, Tcell utilizes pure Go, avoiding CGO dependencies and offers a compatibility layer for termbox. It functions as a library to facilitate the development of command-line interface (CLI) applications and other terminal-based user interfaces, targeting Go developers.
