Tcell is a Go library that provides a cell-based terminal user interface framework for building console applications on Unix-like systems and Windows. It serves as an improved alternative to termbox, offering cross-platform terminal control with support for colors, mouse events, Unicode, and keyboard input handling. The library targets CLI application developers, system administrators, and tool creators who need to build interactive terminal-based programs such as text editors, file managers, monitoring dashboards, and games. Tcell abstracts low-level terminal operations through a clean API, enabling developers to create rich console UIs without dealing with platform-specific terminal control sequences. It's widely adopted in the Go ecosystem for projects like micro editor, fzf fuzzy finder, and various TUI frameworks, serving the DevOps and command-line tooling domains.
