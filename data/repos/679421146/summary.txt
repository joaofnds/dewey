OpenTofu is a Go-based open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables declarative management of cloud and on-premises infrastructure resources. Targeting DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and infrastructure teams, it provides execution planning, dependency graphing, and automated change management for infrastructure provisioning across multiple cloud providers and custom solutions. The tool generates execution plans before applying changes, builds resource dependency graphs for parallel processing, and supports infrastructure versioning through high-level configuration syntax. OpenTofu addresses the challenge of safely scaling infrastructure operations by eliminating manual provisioning errors and providing predictable, repeatable infrastructure deployment workflows across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
