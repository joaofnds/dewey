This repository serves as a curated collection and index of Gleam programming language libraries, packages, and resources. It functions as a community-driven awesome list specifically targeting Gleam developers working across web development, systems programming, and BEAM ecosystem projects. The repository categorizes packages spanning HTTP servers/clients, web frameworks, database connectors, JSON parsing, templating engines, CLI tools, cryptography, and Erlang/OTP integrations. Built using Gleam itself with an automated package discovery system, it addresses the need for centralized resource discovery in the growing Gleam ecosystem. The collection includes both pure Gleam packages and BEAM interoperability libraries, serving functional programming developers who want to leverage Gleam's type safety for web applications, API development, and distributed systems on the Erlang Virtual Machine.
