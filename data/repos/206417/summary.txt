Apache CouchDB is a distributed NoSQL document database written in Erlang that provides seamless multi-master replication and an HTTP/JSON REST API for data operations. Designed for web developers and system administrators managing distributed applications, it serves the big data and cloud computing domains by solving data synchronization challenges across multiple nodes without requiring a primary-secondary architecture. The database stores schema-free JSON documents and enables offline-first applications through its robust conflict resolution and bidirectional sync capabilities. CouchDB targets developers building web applications, mobile backends, and distributed systems who need reliable data replication, high availability, and simple HTTP-based data access without complex query languages or rigid schemas.
