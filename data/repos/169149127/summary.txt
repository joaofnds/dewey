Git History is a JavaScript-based web application and developer tool suite designed for visualizing file evolution in Git repositories through an animated, line-by-line diff interface. Targeting software developers and development teams, it operates as a web service (githistory.xyz) that transforms standard GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket URLs into interactive file history viewers by simply replacing the domain. The project encompasses multiple deployment vectors including browser extensions for Chrome/Firefox, a CLI tool for local repositories, and a VS Code extension for IDE integration. Built with Prism for syntax highlighting and jsdiff for change detection, it addresses the common developer need to quickly understand how specific files have evolved across commits without navigating complex Git interfaces, making code archaeology and historical analysis more accessible for version control workflows.
