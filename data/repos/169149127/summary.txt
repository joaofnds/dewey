`git-history` is a JavaScript-based command-line interface (CLI) and potentially a VS Code extension designed for rapidly exploring the history of a file within any Git repository. It provides functionality to browse commit history, including features related to blame and commit log visualization. The project's architecture likely leverages Git commands and potentially interacts with the GitHub API, with a focus on textual output and animation effects. This developer productivity tool targets software engineers and provides a convenient interface for inspecting Git file history.
