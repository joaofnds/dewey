Chapel is an open-source parallel programming language and compiler designed for high-performance computing (HPC) and scientific computing applications. It targets parallel and distributed computing environments including multicore systems, commodity clusters, supercomputers, and GPU architectures. The language provides built-in concurrency primitives and abstractions that simplify parallel algorithm development while maintaining performance scalability. Chapel addresses the complexity of writing efficient parallel code by offering higher-level language constructs for tasks, data parallelism, and distributed memory programming models compared to traditional HPC languages like C/C++ with MPI or OpenMP. The primary users are computational scientists, HPC developers, and researchers who need to implement scalable parallel algorithms for scientific simulations, numerical computing, and large-scale data processing workloads across distributed computing infrastructures.
