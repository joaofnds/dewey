This repository contains comprehensive Android development guidelines and best practices used by ribot for mobile application development. It provides structured documentation covering project organization, code style standards, and architectural patterns specifically tailored for Android platform development. The guidelines target Android developers and development teams seeking to establish consistent coding practices, proper project structure, and scalable architecture patterns for mobile applications. While the repository is no longer actively maintained and directs users to Android Jetpack for current recommendations, it serves as a reference for traditional Android development methodologies including MVP architecture patterns, dependency injection practices, and code organization strategies that were prevalent in Android development workflows before modern architectural components became standard.
