`frp` is a high-performance reverse proxy enabling secure access to local servers behind NAT or firewalls, operating within the networking and system administration domain. It supports TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols, allowing users to expose internal services via domain names and offering features like P2P connect mode. The project is written in Go, facilitating efficient network tunneling and includes functionalities such as configuration file support (TOML, YAML, JSON), server dashboards, client admin UIs, authentication via tokens and OIDC, TLS encryption, bandwidth limiting, and port range mapping, making it a versatile standalone application for developers and system administrators needing to expose local services to the Internet.
