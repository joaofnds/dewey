frp is a Go-based reverse proxy solution designed for network infrastructure and DevOps environments, enabling system administrators and developers to expose local services behind NAT or firewalls to the internet. The tool implements a client-server architecture supporting TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols with advanced tunneling capabilities including P2P connections, load balancing, and TCP stream multiplexing. It addresses common networking challenges in development workflows, remote access scenarios, and service deployment by providing secure tunneling with authentication (token, OIDC), encryption (TLS), bandwidth limiting, and protocol support including KCP and QUIC. Target users include DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers requiring secure remote access to internal services, local development servers, or services deployed behind restrictive network configurations without complex VPN setups.
