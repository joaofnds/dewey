`go-internals` is a technical educational resource that provides deep-dive documentation on Go programming language internals for advanced developers. The repository contains a work-in-progress book covering low-level Go implementation details including assembly language primers, interface mechanics, and garbage collector operations. Targeting experienced Go developers and systems programmers who need to understand runtime behavior, memory management, and performance characteristics, the content bridges theoretical concepts with actual implementation through code examples, diagrams, and practical experiments. The material addresses the gap in advanced Go resources beyond introductory tutorials, focusing on compiler internals, runtime systems, and language implementation details that are crucial for performance optimization, debugging, and advanced Go development in systems programming and backend development domains.
