This repository is an educational tutorial for operating system development from scratch, targeting the systems programming and computer science education domain. Written primarily in C with assembly language components, it teaches developers how to build a basic OS kernel starting from the boot sector, progressing through 32-bit mode initialization, interrupt handling, screen/keyboard I/O, and basic libc implementation. The tutorial addresses the gap in OS education by providing step-by-step, hands-on instruction for low-level programming concepts without requiring students to navigate existing complex kernels like Linux. It's designed for programmers comfortable with low-level computing who want practical experience in bare-metal programming, bootloader development, and kernel architecture, making systems programming concepts accessible through incremental, well-documented code examples.
