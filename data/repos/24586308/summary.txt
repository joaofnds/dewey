This repository provides a step-by-step tutorial in C for creating a basic operating system from scratch. It guides users through fundamental OS development concepts, including booting without GRUB, entering 32-bit mode, transitioning from assembly to C, interrupt handling, and basic screen output/keyboard input. The project serves as an educational resource, aiming to teach low-level computing concepts without requiring deep knowledge of existing kernels, and it implements a minimal libc to suit its needs. It is a tutorial-based example project, intended for programmers comfortable with low-level computing.
