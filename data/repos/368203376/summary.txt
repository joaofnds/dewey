Snip is a TypeScript-based CLI tool for DevOps and development teams that provides end-to-end encrypted secrets management using OpenPGP encryption standards. The tool enables developers and system administrators to securely store, share, and manage sensitive credentials like API keys, database passwords, and environment files through terminal commands. It features vault-based organization for team collaboration, one-time secret sharing capabilities, and integrates with package managers like Homebrew and npm for easy distribution. Built on a serverless architecture, Snip addresses the common DevOps challenge of securely distributing secrets across development teams without relying on traditional password managers, targeting developers who prefer command-line workflows for credential management and automated deployment pipelines.
