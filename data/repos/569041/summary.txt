Written in C for cross-platform compatibility, it serves as a foundational networking component for web development, DevOps automation, API testing, and system administration tasks. The project addresses URL-based data transfer operations including REST API consumption, file downloads/uploads, email operations, and protocol testing. Target users include software developers integrating HTTP clients, system administrators automating data transfers, DevOps engineers building CI/CD pipelines, and security professionals conducting network assessments, making it ubiquitous across Unix-like systems and embedded in countless applications requiring reliable network communication capabilities.
