GeoGebra is an open-source Java-based mathematical visualization and computation platform that provides interactive geometry, algebra, and calculus tools for educational purposes. The repository contains source code for multiple deployment targets including web applications (using GWT - Google Web Toolkit for browser compatibility) and desktop applications (Classic 5). Built with Gradle as the build system, it serves the mathematics education domain by offering dynamic mathematical modeling, graphing calculators, and geometric construction tools. The platform targets educators, students, and mathematics professionals who need interactive mathematical software for teaching, learning, and mathematical exploration. The web version enables cross-platform accessibility while the desktop version provides native performance for mathematical computations and visualizations.
