`Awesome Cold Showers` is a curated collection of critical analyses, literature reviews, and benchmarking reports that challenge overhyped concepts in software development and computer science. This repository presents concise summaries and links to external resources, including academic papers, blog posts, and video presentations, that provide evidence and caveats against the widespread adoption of specific technologies and methodologies. The project functions as a curated list and a knowledge base of counter-arguments, helping to ground discussions on topics like formal verification, static typing, big data systems, agile methodologies, and microservices. Its target audience likely includes software engineers, researchers, and technical decision-makers seeking a balanced perspective on current trends.
