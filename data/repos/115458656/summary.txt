This repository is a curated collection of academic papers, literature reviews, and technical analyses that provide critical counterpoints to popular programming and software engineering trends. Targeting software developers, researchers, and engineering managers, it covers domains including formal verification, static vs dynamic typing, distributed systems, web framework performance benchmarking, agile methodologies, and software architecture decisions. The collection serves as a technical reality check against industry hype cycles by presenting empirical evidence and rigorous analysis of commonly overstated benefits in technologies like big data systems, formal methods (TLA+, Coq, Z3), type systems (TypeScript, mypy), and development practices. Rather than implementing code, it functions as a knowledge repository helping practitioners make evidence-based decisions by providing academic research that challenges conventional wisdom about programming tools, methodologies, and architectural choices.
