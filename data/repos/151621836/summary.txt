This repository provides a command-line shell script utility for programmatically setting desktop wallpaper images on macOS systems from Mojave (10.14) through Ventura (13.x). The primary script `set-desktop.sh` interfaces with macOS desktop management APIs to modify user desktop backgrounds without requiring GUI interaction, addressing the need for automated desktop customization in system administration and macOS automation workflows. Built using shell scripting, it targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and macOS power users who need to programmatically manage desktop environments across multiple machines or integrate wallpaper changes into larger automation pipelines. The tool solves the specific problem of command-line desktop image management in enterprise macOS deployments where GUI-based configuration is impractical or needs to be scripted for consistency across multiple systems.
