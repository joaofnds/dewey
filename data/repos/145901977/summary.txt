The `microsoft/python-language-server` repository provides a language server implementation for the Python programming language, adhering to the Language Server Protocol (LSP). Its primary functionality is code analysis, offering diagnostics (linting) for Python code, identifying issues such as undefined variables, incorrect argument counts, and import resolution problems. This project, written in C#, is designed to be integrated into IDEs and code editors, primarily serving as a core component for the Python extension in VS Code and Python Tools for Visual Studio. It leverages caching mechanisms for performance and exposes extensive configuration options to control diagnostic behavior and severity.
