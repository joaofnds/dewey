This repository provides a Clojure-based tutorial on Datomic, a distributed, immutable database. It guides users through core Datomic concepts, including schema definition, data insertion, and querying using Datalog. Key functionalities demonstrated include defining data shapes, creating basic and advanced database queries utilizing pull syntax, and modeling parent-child relationships within the Datomic data model. The project serves as an educational resource, presenting example code and practical techniques for interacting with a Datomic database, showcasing its capabilities relative to traditional relational database models.
