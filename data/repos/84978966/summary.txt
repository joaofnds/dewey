This Clojure-based educational repository provides a comprehensive tutorial for Datomic, Cognitect's immutable database system. Targeting Clojure developers and database engineers learning graph-oriented data modeling, it demonstrates core Datomic concepts including schema definition, entity-attribute-value (EAV) data structures, Datalog query syntax, and pull API usage. The tutorial covers practical implementation patterns such as establishing entity relationships through references, managing parent-child hierarchical data, and executing complex queries across connected entities. Written for Datomic version 0.9.5561, it serves as a hands-on guide for developers transitioning from traditional RDBMS approaches to Datomic's schema-flexible, time-aware database paradigm, emphasizing the fundamental shift from table-based to entity-centric data organization in functional programming environments.
