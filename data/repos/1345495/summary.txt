**genact** is a Rust-based CLI application and WebAssembly tool that generates fake terminal activity simulations for entertainment and demonstration purposes. The application targets developers, system administrators, and tech enthusiasts who want to create realistic-looking but harmless computer activity displays. Built with cross-platform compatibility for FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, Windows, and modern web browsers, it features multiple simulation modules including fake compilation processes (Cargo, C compiler), system operations (kernel compilation, memory dumps, Docker builds), security tools (brute force attempts, botnet activity), and package management scenarios. The tool supports configurable speed factors, module selection, timed execution, and provides both native binaries and a web interface via WebAssembly deployment, making it useful for pranks, presentations, or creating busy-looking terminal displays without actual computational work.
