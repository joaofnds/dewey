`genact` is a Rust-based command-line interface (CLI) application designed to generate simulated system activity, providing a "nonsense" multitasking simulation. It features multiple modules that mimic various processes, such as compiling code, running memory dumps, and network activities, providing an entertaining display. The project supports WebAssembly (WASM) for a web-based interface in addition to standalone binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows, and can be installed via package managers like Homebrew and Scoop or directly via `cargo install`. The primary use case is for creating a visually engaging distraction or simulating technical activity, appealing to users such as system administrators or developers who want a lighthearted or entertaining tool.
