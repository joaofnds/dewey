`hostctl` is a Go-based command-line tool designed to manage the `/etc/hosts` file, enabling developers to easily switch between different configurations. It facilitates the management of hostnames through profiles, allowing users to enable, disable, add, and remove groups of host names efficiently. Key features include profile-based host management, integration with text files for profile definition, and synchronization capabilities with Docker containers. This standalone CLI application targets developers seeking improved control over their local DNS resolution and hosts file configuration.
