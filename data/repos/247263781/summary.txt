**hostctl** is a command-line utility written in Go that provides programmatic management of the system hosts file (`/etc/hosts` on Unix-like systems, `C:/Windows/System32/Drivers/etc/hosts` on Windows) for web developers and DevOps engineers. The tool addresses the manual editing complexity of hosts files by introducing profile-based organization, allowing users to create, enable, disable, and switch between different groups of hostname-to-IP mappings. It features Docker and Docker Compose container synchronization, bulk host entry management from text files, and cross-platform compatibility. Primary use cases include local development environment management, DNS override testing, and containerized application development workflows where developers need to frequently modify hostname resolution without manual file editing.
