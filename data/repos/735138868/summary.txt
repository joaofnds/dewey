`gitu` is a standalone, terminal-based Git client written in Rust, providing a TUI (Text User Interface) for Git operations. Inspired by Magit, it offers core Git functionalities including staging, committing, branching, fetching, logging, pulling/pushing, rebasing, resetting, reverting, and stashing. The application is configured via TOML files and aims to replicate Magit's user experience with Vim-like keybindings. It targets developers who prefer a terminal-based Git interface for enhanced productivity.
