Gitu is a terminal user interface (TUI) Git client written in Rust that provides a standalone alternative to Emacs Magit for software developers and DevOps professionals. It implements core Git porcelain operations including staging/unstaging files, branch management, committing, rebasing, stashing, and remote operations through an interactive command-line interface. The application targets developers who prefer terminal-based workflows and want Magit-style Git interaction without requiring Emacs, featuring Vim-like keybindings and configurable editor integration via environment variables. Built as a cross-platform CLI tool, Gitu addresses the need for efficient Git repository management in terminal environments, particularly appealing to developers working in DevOps, systems programming, and general software development workflows who value keyboard-driven interfaces over graphical Git clients.
