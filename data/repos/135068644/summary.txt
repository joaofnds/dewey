Vapor is an Elixir library providing a runtime configuration system for Elixir applications, addressing limitations in existing configuration methods, particularly within releases. It facilitates dynamic configuration loading from various sources, including JSON, YAML, TOML files, and environment variables, along with `.env` file support for local development. Vapor enables the layering of configuration from multiple sources and offers a `Vapor.Plan` behaviour and DSL for modular configuration definition and provider management, primarily intended for developers working on Elixir applications needing flexible, runtime-configurable application settings. This is a developer productivity library.
