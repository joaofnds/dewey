Vapor is a runtime configuration management library for Elixir applications that addresses the complexities of dynamic configuration loading in production deployments. Designed for Elixir/OTP developers building web services and distributed systems, it provides a unified interface for loading configuration from multiple sources including environment variables, JSON/YAML/TOML files, and .env files with configurable precedence ordering. The library implements a provider pattern with built-in type conversion, default values, and validation, supporting both direct struct usage and a DSL through the Vapor.Plan behavior. It specifically targets the gap between Mix compile-time configuration and runtime configuration needs in Elixir releases, enabling applications to dynamically configure database connections, service endpoints, and application parameters during startup without requiring compilation-time knowledge of deployment environments.
