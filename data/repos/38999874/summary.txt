Oniguruma is a comprehensive regular expression library written in C that provides advanced pattern matching capabilities with extensive character encoding support. It targets cross-platform development environments including Linux, Unix, Windows, and embedded systems, supporting 20+ character encodings (UTF-8/16/32, EUC variants, Shift_JIS, ISO-8859 series, etc.). The library implements Unicode 16.0 properties, POSIX compatibility, and advanced regex features like subexpression calls, conditional matching, and various engine options. It serves developers building text processing applications, parsers, compilers, and internationalized software requiring robust multilingual regex support. The library integrates into existing C/C++ codebases and provides both static and dynamic linking options, making it suitable for system-level programming, web servers, database engines, and language interpreters that need high-performance pattern matching across diverse character encodings.
