liblucy is the core compiler implementation for Lucy, a domain-specific language (DSL) designed for state machine modeling and XState integration. Written in C, this compiler provides a WebAssembly compilation target for JavaScript runtime environments including Node.js, enabling Lucy language processing in web development workflows. The repository includes both the core compiler library and lucyc, a command-line interface tool for batch compilation. The project primarily serves frontend developers and JavaScript engineers working with state management patterns, offering a specialized language for defining and compiling state machine logic that integrates with the XState library ecosystem. By compiling to WASM, liblucy bridges native performance with JavaScript accessibility for state machine definition and generation workflows.
