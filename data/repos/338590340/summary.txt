`liblucy` is the core compiler for the Lucy programming language. The project likely focuses on parsing, compiling, and potentially optimizing code written in Lucy. Implied functionality includes the processing of state machine definitions, potentially using the `xstate` keyword to define transitions and states in the Lucy programming language. Built using C, it is likely a library or tool for developers working on projects that require compiling Lucy code, targeting language design or systems-level programming.
