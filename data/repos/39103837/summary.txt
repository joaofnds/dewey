**Bocker** is a minimal containerization system that replicates core Docker functionality using approximately 100 lines of bash scripting, targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators for educational and experimental purposes. Built on Linux kernel primitives including namespaces, cgroups, and btrfs filesystems, it implements essential container operations like image pulling, container execution, process isolation, networking via bridge interfaces, and resource quotas. The system leverages standard Linux utilities (util-linux, iptables, iproute2) and requires btrfs storage backend with network bridge configuration. Bocker demonstrates container orchestration fundamentals by providing Docker-compatible commands (pull, run, ps, logs, commit) while exposing the underlying Linux containerization mechanisms, making it valuable for understanding container internals and prototyping lightweight container solutions in controlled environments.
