`bocker` is a standalone command-line application implemented in approximately 100 lines of Bash, providing a basic implementation of Docker functionality. It allows users to pull container images, run containers, view images and running containers, view logs, commit changes to images, and remove containers/images, with support for networking and cgroup-based resource limitations (quota support). The core functionality mimics Docker's CLI. Its architecture relies on Bash scripting and utilizes several system utilities, including `btrfs-progs`, `curl`, `iproute2`, `iptables`, `libcgroup-tools`, and `util-linux`. This project serves as a simplified, educational tool demonstrating containerization concepts.
