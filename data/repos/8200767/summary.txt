gitignore.io is a server-side Swift web service built with the Vapor framework that generates customized .gitignore files for Git repositories. Targeting software developers and DevOps engineers, it provides both web-based and command-line interfaces for creating .gitignore templates based on operating systems, programming languages, and IDEs. The application runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms using Docker containerization, with LESS preprocessing for CSS assets and comprehensive E2E testing via Puppeteer and Superagent. It addresses the common developer pain point of manually crafting .gitignore files by automating template generation from a curated repository of patterns, supporting various development environments and technology stacks through configurable environment variables and subdirectory hosting capabilities.
