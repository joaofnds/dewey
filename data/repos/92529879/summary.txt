`ghw` is a Go library for hardware discovery and inspection that enables programmatic access to system hardware information across Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and infrastructure developers, it provides cross-platform APIs to query CPU specifications, memory configuration, block storage devices, network interfaces, PCI devices, GPU details, and system topology without requiring root privileges. The library focuses on hardware capacity and capabilities rather than real-time monitoring, making it ideal for inventory management, system profiling, and infrastructure automation tools. It emphasizes consistent interfaces across modules, comprehensive documentation, and direct system queries without shell command dependencies, positioning itself as a foundational component for Go-based system management and cloud infrastructure applications.
