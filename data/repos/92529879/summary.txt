`ghw` is a Go library designed for hardware discovery and inspection on Linux, Windows, and macOS, enabling users to retrieve detailed information about system hardware components. Key functionalities include retrieving data on CPU, memory, block storage, network interfaces, PCI devices, GPU, chassis, BIOS, baseboard, and product information. It provides programmatic access to hardware details, avoiding root privileges where possible and offering data serialization in JSON and YAML formats. This library targets system administrators, developers, and anyone needing to programmatically assess and understand a system's hardware configuration, with the project itself defined as a Go library.
