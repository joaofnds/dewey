The PHP Interpreter repository contains the core source code for the PHP scripting language runtime, implemented primarily in C. This is the official reference implementation that powers PHP's execution engine, including the Zend Engine, built-in functions, and core extensions. Targeting web developers and backend engineers, PHP serves as a server-side scripting language for dynamic web applications, APIs, and general-purpose programming tasks. The codebase includes the lexer, parser, compiler, and virtual machine components that interpret and execute PHP code, along with essential extensions for database connectivity (SQLite), XML processing (libxml2), and web functionality. The repository addresses the fundamental need for a fast, flexible scripting runtime that integrates seamlessly with web servers and supports rapid web application development across diverse hosting environments.
