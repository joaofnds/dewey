vifmimg is a Shell-based image preview system that extends the Vifm vi-style file manager with thumbnail generation capabilities using Ãœberzug for terminal-based image rendering. The tool targets Linux system administrators, terminal power users, and developers who prefer command-line file management workflows. It integrates multiple media processing utilities including ffmpegthumbnailer for video thumbnails, ImageMagick for image manipulation, pdftoppm for PDF previews, and specialized converters for DJVU, EPUB, audio, and font files. The solution addresses the limitation of text-based file managers lacking visual file previews by generating cached thumbnails in ~/.cache/vifm/ and displaying them directly in the terminal interface, enabling efficient visual file browsing without leaving the command-line environment.
