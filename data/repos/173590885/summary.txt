This shell script enhances the Vifm (vi file manager) with image previews, enabling visual representation of various file types including images, videos, PDFs, and audio files within the file manager. Leveraging Ãœberzug for overlay rendering, it caches previews for efficiency. The script integrates with Vifm via configuration and utilizes dependencies such as ffmpegthumbnailer, ImageMagick, pdftoppm, djvulibre-bin, epub-thumbnailer and fontpreview, providing a CLI-based solution for file preview functionality, extending the capabilities of a file manager. This project functions as a developer productivity tool and aims to enhance the user experience within the Vifm file manager.
