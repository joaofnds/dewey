This repository contains the source code and markup for hyperpolyglot.org, a web-based reference site that provides side-by-side syntax comparisons across multiple programming languages. Built with Python, the site serves as a technical reference tool for software developers and programmers who need to quickly translate syntax patterns between different programming languages. The platform addresses the common developer problem of context-switching between languages by presenting equivalent code constructs, operators, control structures, and language features in a comparative format. This educational and reference tool primarily targets polyglot programmers, language learners, and developers working in multi-language codebases who need rapid syntax lookup and cross-language translation capabilities for improved development productivity.
