Frogmouth is a terminal-based Markdown browser and viewer built with Python and the Textual TUI framework, targeting developers and technical users who work extensively with Markdown documentation. The application provides browser-like functionality including navigation stack, history, bookmarks, and table of contents for viewing local `.md` files or remote URLs directly in the terminal. It specifically addresses the need for efficient Markdown consumption in command-line environments, featuring GitHub repository integration that allows direct README viewing via `gh` commands. Cross-platform compatible (Linux, macOS, Windows) and requiring Python 3.8+, Frogmouth serves the developer tools and documentation domain by eliminating context switching between terminal and graphical browsers when reviewing technical documentation, README files, and Markdown-based project documentation.
