Gotypist is a terminal-based touch-typing tutor written in Go that implements Steve Yegge's three-phase typing methodology (fast, slow, normal cycles) for improving programming-focused typing skills. Built using termbox-go for terminal UI rendering and following Elm architecture patterns with pure functional components, it targets software developers and programmers seeking to enhance their typing proficiency. The application provides configurable text sources including built-in dictionaries, custom files, or code snippets, with scoring algorithms that evaluate speed and accuracy differently across each typing phase. Key features include phrase repetition modes, finger positioning hints, and statistical tracking, making it particularly suitable for developers who want to improve their coding speed and reduce typing-related bottlenecks in their programming workflow.
