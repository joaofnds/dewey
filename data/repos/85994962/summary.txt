`gotypist` is a Go-based, standalone command-line application designed as a touch-typing tutor, employing a methodology of iterative typing cycles (fast, slow, normal) for skill development. The application provides a text-based interface built with `termbox-go`, enabling users to practice typing phrases, with scoring based on speed and accuracy.  Its core functionality allows users to practice typing phrases with feedback provided, and it supports customization through file input and options for random number injection and code-based phrase sequencing.  The project loosely implements an Elm-like architecture.
