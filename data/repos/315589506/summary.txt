The Sweep is an open-source hardware project that provides PCB designs and build specifications for a 34-key split ergonomic mechanical keyboard inspired by the Ferris keyboard. Targeting mechanical keyboard enthusiasts and ergonomic computing users, the project offers seven different PCB variants supporting various switch types (Choc v1/v2, MX, Alps, Choc Mini) with optional hot-swap socket compatibility and wireless capabilities via Nice!Nano microcontrollers. The designs utilize Pro Micro-compatible daughter boards instead of onboard components, supporting both wired (TRRS) and Bluetooth connectivity. Firmware support includes QMK, ZMK, and BlueMicro BLE frameworks, with the keyboard identified as "Cradio" in wireless firmware implementations. The project addresses the niche mechanical keyboard community's demand for compact, customizable, ergonomic input devices with comprehensive hardware documentation and multiple form factor options.
