NetNewsWire is a native Swift-based RSS feed reader application for macOS and iOS platforms, targeting end-users who consume syndicated web content. The application implements comprehensive feed parsing capabilities supporting RSS, Atom, JSON Feed, and RSS-in-JSON formats. Built using Xcode and Apple's development frameworks, it provides a cross-platform solution for aggregating and reading web feeds from news sites, blogs, and other content sources. The open-source project addresses the need for a free, privacy-focused alternative to web-based feed readers, enabling users to locally manage and consume syndicated content without relying on third-party services. The codebase includes account synchronization features for services like iCloud and Feedly, along with integrated Reader View functionality for enhanced content consumption.
