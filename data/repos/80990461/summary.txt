This repository provides bare-bones NumPy implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms and models, serving as an educational resource for understanding ML concepts from first principles. Built entirely in Python using NumPy for mathematical operations, it covers supervised learning (linear/polynomial regression, decision trees, neural networks), unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA, GANs), deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, autoencoders), and reinforcement learning algorithms. The codebase prioritizes transparency and accessibility over computational efficiency, making complex algorithms like convolutional neural networks, DBSCAN clustering, and genetic algorithms comprehensible through clean, well-documented implementations. Target users are data science students, ML practitioners, and developers seeking to understand the mathematical foundations underlying popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow and scikit-learn, rather than production-ready implementations.
