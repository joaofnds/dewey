`ML-From-Scratch` is a Python project providing NumPy-based implementations of fundamental machine learning models and algorithms. It offers accessible, from-scratch implementations of supervised learning (e.g., linear regression, SVM, random forest), unsupervised learning (e.g., K-means, GANs, PCA), reinforcement learning (Deep Q-Network), and deep learning algorithms with convolutional and recurrent neural networks. This library is structured as an example/template project, intended for educational purposes, to facilitate understanding of machine learning concepts and algorithms through practical code.
