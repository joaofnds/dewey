This repository serves as a curated directory of public APIs organized by functional domain, targeting web developers, mobile developers, and software engineers who need to integrate third-party services into their applications. The collection spans across diverse technical categories including advertising platforms (Google AdWords, Facebook Marketing), analytics services (Google Analytics, AWS Mobile Analytics), machine learning APIs, payment processing, geolocation services, social media integrations, and data retrieval endpoints. Rather than containing actual code, it functions as a comprehensive reference catalog with structured tables documenting API endpoints, descriptions, and access models (open-source vs. trial-based). The repository addresses the common developer challenge of API discovery and evaluation by providing a centralized, categorized index of available web services, eliminating the need for extensive research when selecting APIs for specific development requirements across web, mobile, and enterprise application development projects.
