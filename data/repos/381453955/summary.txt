`nvim-cmp` is a Neovim plugin, written in Lua, designed as a completion engine. It provides a customizable and extensible framework for code completion, fully supporting Language Server Protocol (LSP) capabilities and enabling smart handling of key mappings to minimize flicker. The plugin allows integration with various completion sources from external repositories, like LSP servers, snippets (vsnip, luasnip, ultisnips, etc.), and buffer content, enhancing developer productivity. This project functions as a plugin primarily intended for Neovim users, particularly those focused on efficient code editing and development within the editor.
