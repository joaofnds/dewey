nvim-cmp is a completion engine plugin for Neovim written in Lua that provides intelligent autocomplete functionality for software developers. It serves as a core text editor enhancement tool that integrates with Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers, snippet engines (vsnip, LuaSnip, UltiSnips), and various completion sources including buffer text, file paths, and command-line completions. The plugin addresses the need for context-aware code completion across multiple programming languages and development workflows by implementing a modular architecture where completion sources are externally sourced and configured. Target users are software developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who use Neovim as their primary text editor and require advanced autocomplete capabilities similar to modern IDEs while maintaining the lightweight, extensible nature of Vim-based editors.
