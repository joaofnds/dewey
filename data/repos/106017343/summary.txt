Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework built in TypeScript that provides low-level utility classes for rapid web UI development. Targeting frontend developers and web development teams, it integrates with PostCSS to generate atomic CSS classes that map directly to CSS properties, enabling component composition without writing custom CSS. The framework addresses the scalability and maintainability challenges of traditional CSS architectures by providing a comprehensive design system through functional CSS classes for spacing, typography, colors, layout, and responsive breakpoints. It serves as a build-time tool that processes HTML templates to generate optimized stylesheets, allowing developers to create consistent, responsive web interfaces while maintaining design flexibility and reducing CSS bundle sizes through unused class purging.
