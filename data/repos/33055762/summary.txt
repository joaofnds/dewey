The `bouk/monkey` repository provides a Go library for runtime monkey patching of functions. It allows users to replace existing function implementations with custom logic by rewriting the executable's memory, enabling dynamic modification of program behavior, primarily for testing purposes. The library offers functions to patch regular and instance methods and includes utilities for unpatching, and calling the original function within the replacement. This is a Go library, and it is designed for use in testing environments, allowing developers to mock or stub functions.
