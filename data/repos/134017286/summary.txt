Lazygit is a terminal-based user interface for Git version control operations, built in Go and targeting software developers and DevOps professionals. It provides an interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface) that simplifies complex Git workflows by offering visual representations of repository state, including staged/unstaged changes, commit history, branches, and merge conflicts. The tool abstracts Git's command-line complexity through keyboard-driven navigation and operations, enabling developers to perform common Git tasks like staging files, creating commits, managing branches, rebasing, and resolving conflicts without memorizing Git CLI syntax. It serves the software development domain by streamlining version control workflows for developers who prefer terminal-based tools over GUI Git clients, particularly beneficial for those working in command-line environments or remote development scenarios.
