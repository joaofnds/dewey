The Prometheus Operator provides Kubernetes-native deployment and management for Prometheus and related monitoring components. It leverages Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to simplify configuring and managing Prometheus, Alertmanager, and other monitoring tools, automating tasks like target configuration and rule generation. Written in Go, the project offers features including automated service discovery through ServiceMonitors and PodMonitors, and validation of PrometheusRule resources via an admission webhook. It is a Kubernetes operator, and it is designed for system administrators and DevOps engineers managing Kubernetes clusters and requiring robust monitoring solutions.
