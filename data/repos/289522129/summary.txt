This repository implements a web-based maze generation application built with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView, targeting web developers and educational programming enthusiasts. The core functionality generates algorithmic mazes through a real-time web interface, leveraging Phoenix's server-side rendering capabilities and LiveView's interactive features for dynamic maze visualization. Built on the Erlang/OTP platform with Node.js for asset compilation, it demonstrates computational geometry and maze generation algorithms in a functional programming paradigm. The application serves developers learning Phoenix LiveView patterns, educators teaching algorithm visualization, and hobbyists exploring procedural maze generation techniques. The deployment-ready codebase includes comprehensive testing with HTML validation, making it suitable for both educational demonstrations and as a reference implementation for LiveView-based interactive applications.
