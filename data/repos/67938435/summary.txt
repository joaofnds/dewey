slack-term is a terminal-based Slack client written in Go that provides a text user interface (TUI) for accessing Slack workspaces directly from the command line. Built using Go's terminal manipulation libraries, it implements a modal interface with vim-like keybindings for navigation, message composition, and channel management. The application targets developers, system administrators, and terminal-oriented users who prefer command-line tools over GUI applications for productivity workflows. It addresses the need for lightweight, keyboard-driven Slack access in terminal-centric development environments, supporting features like channel browsing, message threading, search functionality, and real-time chat through Slack's API integration. The tool is particularly valuable for remote development workflows, server administration tasks, and environments where GUI applications are impractical or unavailable.
