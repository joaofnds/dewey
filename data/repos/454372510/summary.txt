Memphis is a data streaming platform built in Go, designed for backend developers to facilitate real-time data processing and event-driven architectures. It functions as a message broker and message queue, offering features such as schema management (Protobuf, JSON, GraphQL, Avro), data-level observability, dead-letter queues, and storage tiering.  Supporting Kubernetes and Docker Compose deployments, the project provides SDKs for various languages, including Node.js, Python, and Go, and aims to streamline data pipeline creation, enrichment, and stream processing within a microservices-based environment. The project is a standalone application.
