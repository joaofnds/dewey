Memphis.dev is a Kubernetes-native data streaming platform written in Go that provides a production-ready message broker for event-driven architectures and real-time data processing. Targeting backend developers and data engineers, it simplifies the implementation of data pipelines, stream processing, and microservices communication through an integrated message queue system with schema registry capabilities. The platform features dead-letter queues, storage tiering, embedded schema management supporting Protobuf/JSON/GraphQL/Avro formats, and comprehensive SDKs for multiple languages including Go, Python, JavaScript, and .NET. Memphis addresses the complexity barrier that traditionally limited large-scale event ingestion and processing to enterprise-level organizations, offering data-level observability, automatic message retransmission, and real-time processing functions for building scalable streaming applications in cloud-native environments.
