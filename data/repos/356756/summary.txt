Leiningen is a build automation and dependency management tool specifically designed for Clojure programming projects. It serves the JVM ecosystem by providing project scaffolding, dependency resolution, compilation, testing, and packaging capabilities for Clojure applications and libraries. The tool addresses the complexity of managing Clojure project lifecycles, Maven dependencies, and build processes without requiring extensive configuration or Java build tool expertise. Leiningen targets Clojure developers working on JVM-based applications, offering a declarative project.clj configuration approach that simplifies tasks like REPL management, JAR creation, deployment to repositories like Clojars, and integration with existing Java toolchains. It essentially functions as the Clojure equivalent of Maven or Gradle but optimized for functional programming workflows.
