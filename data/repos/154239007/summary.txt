Discord Compiler Bot is a Rust-based Discord bot that provides in-server code compilation and execution capabilities for software developers. The bot integrates with Discord's API to accept code snippets in multiple programming languages (C++, C, Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Go, PHP, Lua) through chat commands, compiles them using external compiler services or local compilation infrastructure, and returns compilation output and program execution results directly within Discord channels. It targets software development communities, programming education environments, and developer collaboration spaces where quick code prototyping, debugging assistance, and concept validation are needed without switching between Discord and external development environments. The bot solves the friction of sharing and testing code snippets in real-time during technical discussions, code reviews, or programming help sessions within Discord-based developer communities.
