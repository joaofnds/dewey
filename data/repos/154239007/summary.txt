A Rust-based Discord bot, `discord-compiler-bot`, enables users to compile and run code snippets directly within Discord. Its core functionality involves interpreting code written in various programming languages (including C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript) and displaying compiler output and program execution results. The project, designed as a standalone application, streamlines the process of testing and prototyping code, and leverages the Discord platform for ease of access and interaction.
