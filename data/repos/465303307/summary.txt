**lo** is a functional programming utility library for Go that provides Lodash-style collection manipulation functions built on Go 1.18+ generics. It offers type-safe operations for slices, maps, channels, and strings including filtering, mapping, reducing, grouping, and searching capabilities. The library targets Go developers working across various domains who need efficient data transformation and collection processing utilities. Key features include parallel processing variants, mutable operations, mathematical helpers, concurrency utilities (debouncing, throttling), error handling constructs, and channel manipulation functions. It serves as a comprehensive toolkit for functional programming patterns in Go, eliminating boilerplate code for common operations like deduplication, chunking, flattening, and set operations while maintaining type safety through generics and offering zero external dependencies beyond the Go standard library.
