BlackHole is a macOS virtual audio loopback driver written in C, designed to pass audio between applications with zero latency. It functions as a system-level driver, enabling the routing of audio streams by creating virtual audio devices. Key features include customizable channel counts (2, 16, 64, 128, 256), sample rate support up to 768kHz, and the ability to create mirrored devices for flexible input/output configurations. This project is a system-level software component providing core audio routing functionality, and is primarily for macOS audio developers and users needing to route audio between applications.
