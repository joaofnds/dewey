BlackHole is a macOS virtual audio loopback driver implemented in C that enables zero-latency audio routing between applications. This system-level driver creates virtual audio devices supporting 2-256 channels and sample rates from 8kHz to 768kHz, functioning as a software equivalent to physical audio cables. It targets audio engineers, content creators, and developers working with digital audio workstations (DAWs), streaming applications, and audio processing software. The driver integrates with macOS Core Audio framework without requiring kernel extensions, allowing applications like Logic Pro X, GarageBand, or Zoom to send audio output directly to another application's input. Primary use cases include live streaming with DAW audio, recording system audio, and complex audio routing setups for professional audio production workflows.
