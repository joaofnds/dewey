fasthttp is a high-performance HTTP implementation for Go designed as a drop-in replacement for Go's standard net/http package, targeting web development and high-throughput server applications. Built specifically for edge cases requiring extreme performance, it achieves up to 10x faster request processing than net/http through zero memory allocations in hot paths and optimized connection handling. The library serves backend developers and systems engineers building web servers, APIs, and microservices that must handle thousands of concurrent requests per second with consistent low-latency responses. It's particularly suited for production environments processing high volumes of small to medium HTTP requests, as demonstrated by real-world deployments handling 200K RPS from 1.5M+ concurrent keep-alive connections, making it ideal for performance-critical web infrastructure and load-intensive HTTP services.
