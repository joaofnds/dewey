`fasthttp` is a high-performance HTTP library written in Go, designed for building HTTP servers and clients with a focus on speed and efficiency. It provides an alternative to Go's standard `net/http` package, optimizing for reduced memory allocation and faster response times, particularly in scenarios involving thousands of small to medium requests per second. Key features include zero-allocation in hot paths, benchmark results showing performance advantages over `net/http`, and functionalities for handling HTTP requests and responses. The project is a Go library intended for developers building backend HTTP servers or clients prioritizing performance, potentially for high-traffic applications.
