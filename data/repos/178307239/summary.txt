`contrata-se-devs` is a web application designed to facilitate the connection between software developers and companies seeking to hire. The application allows companies to list open positions and helps developers find programming jobs. Built using Next.js, the project utilizes a JSON file (`companies.json`) for data management, which users can contribute to by submitting Pull Requests with company information, including website URLs and logos, to populate a directory of developer job opportunities. This is a standalone web application, targeting both developers searching for jobs and companies looking to hire.
