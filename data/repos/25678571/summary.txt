Qtools is a Common Lisp utility collection that provides a higher-level development layer over CommonQt for building cross-platform GUI applications. It addresses the awkward interface patterns of raw CommonQt by offering streamlined widget class definitions, garbage collection handling, name mapping utilities, and simplified Qt object management. The library targets Common Lisp developers building desktop applications with Qt, providing macros and abstractions that make Qt's C++ class hierarchy and signal-slot system more idiomatic to Lisp programming. Qtools works through the Qt→Smoke→CommonQt stack, allowing developers to leverage Qt's mature GUI toolkit while maintaining Lisp-native development patterns. It solves the friction between Qt's object-oriented C++ design and functional Lisp paradigms, enabling modular adoption where developers can mix Qtools utilities with plain CommonQt as needed.
