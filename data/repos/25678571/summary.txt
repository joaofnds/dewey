`Qtools` is a Common Lisp library providing utilities and a framework to streamline GUI development with CommonQt, a Common Lisp binding for the Qt toolkit. It offers features including widget class definition, name mapping, memory management (finalization), and a system for deploying applications. The library utilizes Smoke for interfacing with the C++ Qt library, providing macro-based abstractions and readtable extensions (Q+) to simplify method calling and improve developer productivity. It functions as a developer productivity tool and a GUI framework designed to aid Common Lisp developers building cross-platform Qt applications.
