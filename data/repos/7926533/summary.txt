go-mode.el is an Emacs major mode for Go programming language development, providing comprehensive IDE-like functionality for Go developers working within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. Built in Emacs Lisp, it delivers syntax highlighting, code formatting through gofmt/goimports integration, import management, documentation lookup via godoc, code navigation with godef, and Go Playground integration. The mode supports advanced Go-specific features including function signature manipulation, method receiver handling, code coverage visualization, and Language Server Protocol integration through gopls. It replaces the original go-mode that was previously distributed with Go itself, serving as the canonical Emacs editing environment for Go software engineers building web services, system tools, and distributed applications in the Go ecosystem.
