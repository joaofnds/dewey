franz-go is a pure Go Apache Kafka client library targeting distributed systems and event streaming applications. It provides comprehensive Kafka protocol support from version 0.8.0 through 3.8+, implementing producer/consumer APIs, transactional semantics, consumer groups, admin operations, and all SASL authentication mechanisms. The library serves backend developers and platform engineers building event-driven microservices, real-time data pipelines, and message streaming architectures. It emphasizes performance through zero-allocation optimizations, supports all Kafka-compatible brokers (Redpanda, Confluent, MSK, Event Hubs), and includes additional packages for schema registry integration and cluster administration. The client handles complex Kafka features like exactly-once semantics, cooperative rebalancing, and regex topic consumption while providing idiomatic Go APIs with context support.
