`franz-go` is a feature-complete, pure Go library designed for interacting with Apache Kafka brokers, supporting versions 0.8.0 through 3.8+ and compatible with Redpanda, Confluent Platform, and others. This library provides a comprehensive Kafka client, enabling users to produce, consume, and administer Kafka clusters with features including transactions, group and simple consumers, all compression types, SASL/SSL authentication, and administrative functions. Built in Go, it offers an idiomatic API, plug-in metrics support, and high performance, supporting a wide array of Kafka Improvement Proposals (KIPs). It functions as a client library for Go developers building applications that integrate with Kafka-based data streaming platforms.
