Pry is a Ruby runtime developer console and interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) that serves as an advanced alternative to Ruby's standard IRB shell. Built specifically for Ruby developers working in web development, scripting, and general Ruby programming, Pry provides powerful introspection and debugging capabilities including source code browsing, live documentation access, method editing, and runtime state navigation through commands like `cd` and `ls`. The tool integrates with Rails applications, supports syntax highlighting, offers shell command integration, and features a flexible command system inspired by IPython and Smalltalk REPLs. Pry enables REPL-driven development by allowing developers to inject interactive debugging sessions into running Ruby applications, explore object hierarchies, view method definitions including C source code, and manipulate program state in real-time, making it an essential tool for Ruby developers seeking enhanced debugging and development workflow capabilities.
