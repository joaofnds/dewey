It provides features for source code browsing, documentation lookup, method editing within editors, and command-shell integration, offering syntax highlighting and customization capabilities.  This Ruby-based project allows developers to navigate program state, invoke REPL sessions during runtime for debugging and modification, and utilize a flexible command system with extensive plugin support. Pry facilitates REPL-driven programming for Ruby, functioning primarily as a command-line tool and a development aid for Ruby developers.
