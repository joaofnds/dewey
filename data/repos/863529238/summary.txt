Borkweb is a full-stack Clojure framework designed for modern web development, prioritizing simplicity, minimality, and traditional principles. It enables full-stack development using ClojureScript (Squint) for the frontend, Gaka for CSS, and Babashka for the backend, backed by a traditional SQL database. Key functionalities include routing capabilities, CRUD helper functions for common database operations, and built-in testing utilities with Etaoin for e2e and http-kit.client for API tests. This project functions as a framework, providing a foundation for building web applications with Clojure, targeting Clojure developers.
