Borkweb is a full-stack web development framework for Clojure that enables building web applications using Clojure/ClojureScript across the entire stack. It targets web developers seeking a simplified alternative to complex modern frameworks, running on Babashka (lightweight Clojure runtime) with JVM Clojure compatibility. The framework integrates Squint for ClojureScript frontend compilation, Gaka for CSS generation, traditional SQL databases (HSQLDB/PostgreSQL), and includes batteries-included components like authentication, routing (via Ruuter), database connectivity (HoneySQL, next.jdbc), HTTP handling (http-kit, Ring), and frontend rendering with Preact. It eliminates Node.js dependencies and complex build pipelines, providing a minimal-overhead solution for developers who want to build traditional web applications entirely in Clojure without extensive configuration or modern JavaScript toolchain complexity.
