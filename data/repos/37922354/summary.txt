JSCity is a JavaScript-based data visualization tool that transforms JavaScript source code into interactive 3D "code cities." This application visualizes code structure, representing folders, files, and functions as districts, sub-districts, and buildings, respectively, with building height and base size reflecting code complexity metrics like lines of code and variable count. Built using three.js for 3D rendering, it leverages node.js with modules like MySQL and esprima for code parsing and data storage, and operates as a standalone web application accessed through a web server. This project provides a novel software visualization approach, potentially benefiting developers seeking to explore and understand complex JavaScript codebases.
