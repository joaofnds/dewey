JSCity is a JavaScript-based software visualization tool that implements the Code City metaphor to render JavaScript source code as navigable 3D cities using Three.js. Targeted at software developers and code analysts in web development, it transforms code structure into spatial representations where directories become districts, files become sub-districts, and functions become buildings with height corresponding to Lines of Code (LOC) and base size reflecting Number of Variables (NOV). The system uses Node.js for backend processing, MySQL for data storage, and distinguishes named functions (blue buildings) from anonymous functions (green buildings). It addresses the problem of understanding complex JavaScript codebases by providing intuitive 3D visualization, enabling developers to spatially navigate and comprehend code architecture, function relationships, and code metrics through an interactive web-based interface.
