Pixie is a lightweight Lisp dialect implemented in RPython that compiles to native bytecode with JIT compilation and garbage collection. Built for general-purpose programming and shell scripting, it targets developers seeking a functional programming language with Clojure-inspired syntax and high performance characteristics. The interpreter leverages RPython's tracing JIT compiler (from the PyPy project) to achieve native-level execution speeds while maintaining a small runtime footprint (~10MB). Key technical features include immutable data structures, protocol-based polymorphism, transducers, FFI capabilities, and a polymorphic math system. Dependencies include libffi, libedit, libuv, and Boost libraries. The project addresses the need for a fast, lightweight functional language that combines Lisp's expressiveness with modern JIT performance, suitable for both application development and systems scripting tasks.
