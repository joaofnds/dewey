Pixie is a lightweight, native Lisp interpreter and virtual machine designed for both general-purpose programming and shell scripting. Written in RPython, it features a fast garbage collector and a tracing JIT compiler, enabling high performance. Key functionalities include immutable data structures, protocol-first implementation, transducers, and easy foreign function interface (FFI). The project is a standalone application, providing its own bytecode execution environment, and targets developers interested in functional programming and scripting languages. It leverages dependencies like libffi-dev, libedit-dev, libuv-dev, and libboost-all-dev for building.
