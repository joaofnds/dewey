xi-mac is a macOS frontend for the xi-editor text editing system, built using Swift and Cocoa frameworks. This native Mac application provides the user interface layer for a high-performance text editor with a Rust-based backend core, targeting software developers and technical writers who require fast, reliable code editing capabilities. The application implements modern macOS UI patterns using Core Text for advanced text rendering, supports Unicode fully, and integrates with development workflows through command-line tools and git editor functionality. The project addresses the need for a performant, native text editor that leverages platform-specific technologies while maintaining cross-platform compatibility through its modular frontend-backend architecture, competing in the developer tools and code editor domain.
