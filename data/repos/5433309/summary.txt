Lumen is a self-hosted Lisp dialect compiler that transpiles to both Lua and JavaScript runtimes, targeting programming language development and cross-platform scripting domains. Built in JavaScript with Node.js support, it provides an extensible reader, macro system, and special forms while maintaining close compatibility with target runtime environments. The language features functional programming primitives, lexical scoping, pattern matching, and supports both positional and named parameters in function definitions. Lumen addresses the need for a unified Lisp-syntax language that can execute across JavaScript and Lua ecosystems, making it suitable for developers working on multi-platform scripting, embedded systems programming, or those requiring Lisp semantics in web and game development contexts where Lua/JavaScript are prevalent.
