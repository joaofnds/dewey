Sparkling is a Clojure wrapper library for Apache Spark that provides idiomatic functional programming interfaces for distributed data processing workloads. Targeting data engineers and Clojure developers in the big data analytics domain, it enables creation of Spark applications using Clojure's functional paradigms while maintaining full access to Spark's RDD operations, SQL capabilities, and distributed computing features. The library addresses the impedance mismatch between Spark's Java/Scala APIs and Clojure's functional programming model by providing native Clojure functions for transformations, actions, and data serialization. Key features include support for various data sources (JDBC, AVRO, text files), custom Kryo serialization registration, broadcast variables, and accumulators, allowing data scientists and engineers to leverage Spark's distributed processing power within Clojure's REPL-driven development workflow.
