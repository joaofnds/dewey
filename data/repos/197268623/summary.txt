This repository contains a collection of programming exercises for the Gleam programming language as part of the Exercism platform, an online coding practice and mentorship community. The track serves software developers learning Gleam, a functional programming language that compiles to Erlang bytecode and runs on the BEAM virtual machine. The exercises are designed to teach Gleam's syntax, functional programming concepts, pattern matching, and BEAM ecosystem integration through hands-on coding challenges. Each exercise includes test suites, example solutions, and automated validation workflows using GitHub Actions and Exercism's configlet tool. The repository targets developers interested in functional programming, concurrent systems, and fault-tolerant applications, providing a structured learning path for mastering Gleam's type system, immutable data structures, and actor model concurrency patterns inherent to the Erlang/OTP platform.
