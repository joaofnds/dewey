Nippy is a high-performance Clojure serialization library that provides a fast alternative to Clojure's built-in reader for data persistence and transmission. It targets backend developers and data engineers working with Clojure applications requiring efficient serialization of rich data types to databases, caches, or distributed systems. The library supports comprehensive Clojure data types, optional LZ4/Zstandard compression, AES128 encryption, and fallback mechanisms to Java Serializable and EDN. It solves performance bottlenecks in data-intensive applications where standard Clojure reader serialization becomes too slow, offering mature production-ready functionality used by major projects like Redis client Carmine, DynamoDB client Faraday, and distributed databases XTDB and Datalevin for scalable data serialization workflows.
