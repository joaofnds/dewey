Nippy is a high-performance serialization library for Clojure, designed as a drop-in replacement for Clojure's reader to efficiently serialize and deserialize Clojure data structures. It supports all standard Clojure data types and offers features like optional LZ4 or Zstandard compression, AES128 encryption, and integration tools for 3rd-party libraries.  This library is geared towards developers working with large Clojure datasets, aiming to enhance performance in scenarios such as database serialization.  Nippy is a pure-Clojure library that includes a robust test suite and is actively used in production environments.
