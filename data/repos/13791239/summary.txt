upper/db is a Go-based data access layer (DAL) that provides a unified, database-agnostic interface for interacting with multiple database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, CockroachDB, MongoDB, SQLite, and QL. Targeting backend Go developers building web applications and data-driven services, it abstracts database-specific implementations behind a consistent API while offering ORM-like features for both SQL and NoSQL databases. The library solves the problem of vendor lock-in and reduces code complexity when working with heterogeneous database environments, enabling developers to switch between different database backends without rewriting application logic. It serves enterprise and web development domains where polyglot persistence and database flexibility are required.
