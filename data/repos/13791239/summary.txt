It supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, CockroachDB, MongoDB, SQLite, and other SQL/NoSQL databases, abstracting database-specific interactions. Key functionalities include data access and manipulation through an agnostic interface. This library is intended for Go developers building applications that require database interactions, serving as a tool to increase developer productivity by streamlining database interactions and reducing the complexity of writing code to interact with different databases.
