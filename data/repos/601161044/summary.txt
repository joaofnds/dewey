`transformers.js` is a JavaScript library enabling state-of-the-art machine learning, specifically Transformers, to run directly in web browsers without server dependencies. This library provides a functionally equivalent API to Hugging Face's Python `transformers` library, supporting common NLP, computer vision, audio, and multimodal tasks such as text classification, object detection, and speech recognition. Built on ONNX Runtime, the library allows the execution of pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX models, offering GPU acceleration through WebGPU and model quantization for resource optimization, making it a valuable tool for front-end developers and data scientists. This is a JavaScript library.
