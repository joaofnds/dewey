Transformers.js is a JavaScript library that brings Hugging Face's machine learning transformers directly to web browsers without requiring server infrastructure. Built on ONNX Runtime, it enables client-side execution of pre-trained models for natural language processing, computer vision, audio processing, and multimodal tasks including text classification, image recognition, speech recognition, and text generation. The library targets web developers and ML engineers who need to integrate state-of-the-art AI capabilities into frontend applications, providing a pipeline API functionally equivalent to the Python transformers library. It supports both NPM installation and CDN deployment, with models converted from PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX using Hugging Face Optimum, running on CPU via WebAssembly or GPU via WebGPU for browser-based machine learning inference.
