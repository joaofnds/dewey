**cq** is a command-line data processing tool built in Clojure that enables structural querying and transformation of multiple data formats including JSON, YAML, EDN, XML, CSV, MsgPack, and Transit using Clojure syntax as the query language. Targeting DevOps engineers, data engineers, and backend developers who work with API responses, configuration files, and data pipelines, it leverages GraalVM native compilation for fast startup times and integrates libraries like Specter, Medley, and data transformation utilities. The tool solves the problem of having to learn format-specific query languages (like jq for JSON) by providing a unified Clojure-based interface with threading macros and reader macros for complex data manipulations across heterogeneous data sources in shell scripting and automation workflows.
