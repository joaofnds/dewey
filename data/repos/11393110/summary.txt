urfave/cli is a Go library that provides a declarative framework for building command-line interface applications and tools. It targets Go developers across various domains including DevOps, system administration, and application development who need to create CLI utilities with sophisticated argument parsing and user interaction capabilities. The library implements a zero-dependency solution (beyond Go standard library) that handles commands, subcommands, flag parsing, shell completion for multiple shells (bash, zsh, fish, powershell), and configuration input from environment variables and structured files (JSON, YAML, TOML). It solves the common problem of building robust, user-friendly command-line tools by abstracting complex argument parsing logic and providing built-in help systems, documentation generation, and flexible input validation for various data types including primitives, slices, and time-based values.
