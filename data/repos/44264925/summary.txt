This repository hosts a Visual Studio Code extension designed to provide comprehensive language support for Go. Primarily implemented in TypeScript, it offers features to enhance the development experience for Go programmers within the VS Code environment. Functionality includes, but is not limited to, code completion, linting, debugging, and potentially other language-specific tooling. The extension acts as a plugin, integrating Go language features directly into the VS Code IDE.
