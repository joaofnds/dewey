`fsnotify/fsnotify` is a Go library providing cross-platform filesystem notification capabilities. It offers a unified API for monitoring file system events, leveraging platform-specific backends like `inotify` on Linux, `kqueue` on macOS and BSD, and `ReadDirectoryChangesW` on Windows. The library enables developers to detect file modifications, additions, and deletions, targeting Go developers building applications that require real-time responsiveness to filesystem changes, suitable for tasks such as file synchronization, build automation, or content management systems. The project is a Go library intended for integration into other applications.
