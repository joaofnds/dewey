fsnotify is a cross-platform Go library that provides filesystem event notifications for monitoring file and directory changes across Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD, and illumos systems. It abstracts platform-specific APIs including Linux inotify, BSD/macOS kqueue, Windows ReadDirectoryChangesW, and illumos FEN into a unified Go interface. The library serves system administrators, DevOps engineers, and backend developers building file monitoring applications, configuration watchers, build systems, and automated deployment tools that need to react to filesystem modifications in real-time. It addresses the core problem of cross-platform file system event handling without requiring platform-specific code, enabling developers to create portable monitoring solutions for CI/CD pipelines, log processors, and development tools that trigger actions based on file changes.
