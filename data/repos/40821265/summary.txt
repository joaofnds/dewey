babel-plugin-module-resolver is a Babel plugin that provides custom module resolution for JavaScript/TypeScript projects during transpilation. It targets web and mobile developers working with modern JavaScript build pipelines, allowing them to define custom root directories and path aliases to simplify import/require statements. Instead of using complex relative paths like `../../../../utils/MyUtilFn`, developers can configure shorter aliases like `utils/MyUtilFn`. The plugin integrates with the Babel ecosystem and supports both ES6 imports and CommonJS requires, working alongside ESLint resolvers and IDE autocompletion systems. It's widely adopted by major projects including React Native applications, Vue.js frameworks, and Node.js libraries, solving the common developer experience problem of maintaining lengthy relative import paths in large codebases.
