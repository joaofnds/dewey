The `campoy/todo` repository implements a task management application designed to demonstrate Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles in Go. It provides a REST API for managing tasks, accessible via the `/task/` endpoint and can be deployed as a standalone HTTP server or on Google App Engine. The project includes a frontend built with AngularJS to consume the REST API, enabling basic task creation and management. This is an example project demonstrating Go programming, TDD, and REST API implementation for educational purposes.
