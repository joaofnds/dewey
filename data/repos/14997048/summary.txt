TODO is an educational task management application written in Go that demonstrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices and REST API implementation patterns for web developers. The repository serves as a step-by-step tutorial where each commit represents a development iteration, showcasing TDD workflows from failing tests to implementation and refactoring. The application implements a RESTful API server using Go's standard HTTP packages, provides both standalone HTTP server and Google App Engine deployment options, and includes an AngularJS frontend for API consumption. Targeted at Go developers learning TDD methodologies and REST API development, the project addresses common web development challenges including API design, testing strategies, and full-stack integration using Go backend services with JavaScript frontend frameworks.
