`zoxide` is a command-line tool designed to enhance developer productivity by providing a "smarter cd command." Written in Rust, it remembers and quickly navigates to frequently used directories, enabling users to "jump" to them with fewer keystrokes. The software incorporates a matching algorithm for fuzzy directory selection and integrates with major shells (Bash, Fish, Zsh, Nushell, PowerShell, Elvish, Tcsh, and Xonsh) by providing shell initialization scripts and offers optional integration with `fzf` for interactive directory selection. This standalone CLI application targets shell users seeking improved directory navigation and streamlined command-line workflows, as well as users of various file managers such as ranger or lf, and tmux/zellij session managers.
