lsp-ui is an Emacs Lisp package that provides enhanced user interface components for Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration within the Emacs text editor. Targeting software developers across multiple programming languages, it extends lsp-mode with visual features including sideline diagnostics display, peek-style code navigation (definitions/references), hover documentation in child frames, flycheck integration for syntax checking, and imenu symbol browsing. The package implements four core modules: lsp-ui-sideline for inline code information, lsp-ui-peek for VSCode-style peek functionality, lsp-ui-doc for contextual documentation display, and lsp-ui-imenu for structured code navigation. It integrates with xref, flycheck, and WebKit rendering to deliver IDE-like capabilities within Emacs, solving the problem of limited visual feedback and navigation features in traditional text-based development environments for programmers using Emacs as their primary development platform.
