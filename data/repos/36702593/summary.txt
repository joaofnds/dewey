`Deft` is an Emacs mode designed for efficient browsing, filtering, and editing of plain text notes, functioning as a note-taking and file management tool within the Emacs editor. It provides a file browser that lists note titles, summaries, and modification times, allowing users to filter notes using a search string that matches both title and body content. Implemented in Emacs Lisp, Deft facilitates rapid note creation, editing, and organization, offering features such as automatic file naming, support for multiple file extensions (including .txt, .md, .org), recursive directory searching, and integration with the MELPA package manager. This is a plugin/extension for Emacs, aimed at Emacs users who desire enhanced note-taking and plain-text file management capabilities.
