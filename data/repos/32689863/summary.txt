Manim is a Python-based animation engine designed for creating explanatory math videos. It provides programmatic control over visual elements, enabling precise animations for educational content and scientific visualizations. The software supports various features, including scene management, object manipulation, and integration with LaTeX for mathematical notation, and it functions primarily as a library. The project leverages Python 3.7+ and depends on libraries like FFmpeg, OpenGL, and, optionally, LaTeX for advanced rendering and formatting, targeting users creating visual explanations.
