Manim (ManimGL) is a Python-based programmatic animation engine specifically designed for creating mathematical explanatory videos, developed by 3Blue1Brown. The framework provides precise animation capabilities for mathematical concepts using OpenGL for rendering, FFmpeg for video processing, and LaTeX for mathematical typesetting. It targets educational content creators, mathematics educators, and technical video producers who need to programmatically generate complex mathematical animations through Python code rather than traditional GUI-based animation tools. The system solves the problem of creating reproducible, version-controlled mathematical visualizations by allowing animations to be defined as code, enabling precise timing control, mathematical object manipulation, and scene composition for educational video production in the mathematics and science education domain.
