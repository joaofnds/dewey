**refactoring.nvim** is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides automated code refactoring capabilities based on Martin Fowler's refactoring patterns. Built on Treesitter for syntax parsing and targeting software developers across multiple programming languages (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, C#, Lua), it implements common refactoring operations including Extract Function (#106), Inline Function (#115), Extract Variable (#119), and Inline Variable (#123). The plugin integrates with Neovim's LSP ecosystem and offers debugging utilities like automated printf insertion and cleanup. It addresses the critical need for reliable, editor-integrated refactoring tools that maintain code correctness during structural changes, enabling developers to safely restructure codebases without manual error-prone transformations across polyglot development environments.
