Kalendar is a C++-based calendar and task management application built for the KDE Plasma desktop environment using the Kirigami UI framework. It leverages Akonadi as its backend to provide multi-protocol synchronization with external calendar services including CalDAV (Nextcloud), Google Calendar, Exchange, and Kolab groupware servers. The application targets desktop productivity users seeking cross-platform calendar functionality that works on both desktop and mobile devices within the KDE ecosystem. Kalendar integrates with KDE Frameworks 5.96+ and kdepim-runtime to handle event creation, editing, and synchronization across local and remote calendar sources. It serves as a modern, user-friendly alternative to KOrganizer while maintaining compatibility with Plasma's digital clock widget and supporting standard calendar protocols for enterprise and personal productivity workflows.
