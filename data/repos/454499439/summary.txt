This repository implements a minimal DNS resolver that demonstrates the core mechanics of DNS query resolution by manually traversing the DNS hierarchy from root servers to authoritative nameservers. Built primarily in Go with additional implementations in Bash and Python, it serves as an educational tool for understanding DNS protocol internals and network programming concepts. The resolver bypasses system DNS libraries to perform raw UDP socket communication with DNS servers, making it valuable for network engineers, system administrators, and developers learning about DNS infrastructure, network protocols, and low-level networking concepts. Rather than providing production DNS functionality, it focuses on illustrating the step-by-step DNS resolution process for educational and debugging purposes.
