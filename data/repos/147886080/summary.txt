Crossplane is a Kubernetes-based cloud native control plane framework written in Go that enables infrastructure-as-code management across multiple cloud providers without requiring custom code development. It operates in the cloud computing and DevOps domain, providing a declarative API for orchestrating applications and infrastructure resources through Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and Kubernetes controllers. The platform targets platform engineers, DevOps teams, and infrastructure administrators who need to manage multi-cloud environments, implementing GitOps workflows for infrastructure provisioning. Crossplane extends Kubernetes' API server model to manage external cloud resources like AWS EC2 instances, Azure databases, or GCP storage buckets as native Kubernetes objects, solving the complexity of multi-cloud infrastructure management through a unified, extensible control plane architecture.
