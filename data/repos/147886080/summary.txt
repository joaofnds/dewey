Crossplane is a cloud-native control plane framework, written in Go, designed for managing and orchestrating cloud infrastructure and applications across multiple cloud providers and on-premise environments. It enables users to build control planes without writing code, offering a declarative API for infrastructure-as-code management. Key functionalities include infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and lifecycle management, leveraging Kubernetes for control and extensibility. As a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project, Crossplane is a framework targeting developers and operations teams managing cloud-native infrastructure, providing a unified control plane for complex, multi-cloud deployments.
