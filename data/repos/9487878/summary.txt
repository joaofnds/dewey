indent-guide.el is an Emacs Lisp package that renders vertical guide lines to visualize code indentation structure within the Emacs text editor. Targeted at software developers and programmers across all domains who use Emacs for coding, it addresses the common problem of tracking indentation levels in nested code blocks by overlaying subtle vertical lines that align with indentation boundaries. The package integrates directly with Emacs' display system using face properties and character overlays, supporting both spaces and TAB characters while offering configurable appearance, delay timing, and selective display modes. It provides superior block detection for LISP-like languages compared to alternatives like highlight-indentation, though with some performance trade-offs in deeply nested code structures, making it particularly valuable for developers working with heavily indented codebases.
