`polyfy/polylith` is a Clojure-based tool designed for developing applications and architectures based on the Polylith architecture style. The tool facilitates the creation and management of Polylith components, likely enabling modular and composable Clojure codebases. This project functions as a developer productivity tool, simplifying the application of the Polylith principles within the Clojure ecosystem. It likely assists in code organization, build processes, and potentially other aspects of a Polylith-based Clojure project.
