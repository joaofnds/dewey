Polylith is a Clojure-based architectural tool that enables developers to build modular systems using composable "service level building blocks" that function like LEGO bricks. It targets Clojure developers working on JVM-based applications, providing a workspace architecture where reusable components, interfaces, and bases can be combined into different deployable artifacts such as services and tools. The tool integrates into existing build pipelines and supports unified development from a single REPL environment, allowing developers to work with all code in one place while maintaining clear separation of concerns through its brick-based architecture. It addresses the problem of code reusability and system modularity in enterprise Clojure development by enforcing structured component boundaries and enabling incremental testing and deployment of only changed components.
