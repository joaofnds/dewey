ALE (Asynchronous Lint Engine) is a Vim/Neovim plugin that provides real-time syntax checking, linting, and code fixing capabilities for software developers across multiple programming languages. Built using Vim Script, it leverages Vim 8+ and Neovim's asynchronous job control to run linters like eslint, pylint, and autopep8 without blocking the editor. The plugin serves as a Language Server Protocol (LSP) client, offering IDE-like features including diagnostics, go-to-definition, autocomplete, reference finding, and hover information. It targets software developers working in diverse languages and environments, providing a lightweight, dependency-free alternative to heavier IDE solutions while maintaining compatibility with remote development workflows and legacy Vim installations.
