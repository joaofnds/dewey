Emacs-slack is a native GNU Emacs client for Slack workspace communication, targeting developers and technical professionals who prefer text-based interfaces and Emacs-centric workflows. Built entirely in Emacs Lisp, it provides full Slack functionality including real-time messaging, channel management, direct messages, file uploads, emoji reactions, threading, and search capabilities through WebSocket connections and Slack's REST API. The client handles authentication via xoxc tokens and cookies, supports multiple team configurations, and integrates with Emacs' auth-source library for secure credential management. It leverages key dependencies including websocket for real-time communication, request for HTTP operations, circe for UI components, and alert for notifications, solving the problem of context-switching between Slack's web/desktop clients and Emacs-based development environments.
