Yazi is a terminal-based file manager written in Rust that leverages asynchronous I/O and multi-threading for high-performance filesystem operations. Targeting developers, system administrators, and CLI power users, it addresses the limitations of traditional synchronous file managers through non-blocking async operations, concurrent task scheduling, and cross-platform terminal integration. The application features a Lua-based plugin system, built-in image preview protocols (Kitty, iTerm2, Sixel), code syntax highlighting, and integrates with developer tools like ripgrep, fd, fzf, and zoxide. Its client-server architecture enables cross-instance communication and state persistence, while supporting vim-like keybindings, bulk operations, and extensible theming for terminal-centric development workflows.
