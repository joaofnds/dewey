The Ruby Toolbox is a Ruby on Rails web application that serves as a comprehensive catalog and discovery platform for Ruby gems (libraries). Built with PostgreSQL for data persistence, Redis for caching, and Sidekiq for background job processing, it aggregates and analyzes popularity metrics, maintenance status, and health indicators of open source Ruby libraries from RubyGems and GitHub repositories. The platform targets Ruby developers and software engineers who need to evaluate and select reliable, actively maintained dependencies for their projects. It integrates with GitHub's GraphQL API to collect repository statistics and uses automated data processing to rank gems by various criteria including download counts, commit activity, and community engagement, solving the critical problem of library selection in the Ruby ecosystem.
