KubeVela is a Kubernetes-native application delivery platform built in Go that implements the Open Application Model (OAM) specification to simplify multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud application deployment. It provides a declarative workflow engine using CUE language for "deployment as code," enabling DevOps engineers and platform teams to orchestrate complex application delivery across multiple clusters and cloud environments. The platform integrates with existing CI/CD pipelines, GitOps workflows, and Helm charts while offering built-in multi-tenancy, RBAC, observability, and progressive delivery capabilities including canary deployments and blue-green strategies. KubeVela operates as a lightweight Kubernetes controller that extends native Kubernetes resources with workload and trait abstractions, targeting platform engineers who need to standardize application delivery processes across distributed infrastructure environments while maintaining extensibility through a addon ecosystem.
