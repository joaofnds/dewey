KubeVela is a modern application delivery platform built in Go, designed to simplify and accelerate the deployment and operation of applications across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. It provides a declarative, workflow-driven approach to application deployment, leveraging the Open Application Model (OAM) for defining deployments as code and integrating with CI/CD systems. Key features include built-in observability, multi-tenancy and security support, and native support for multi-cluster/hybrid-cloud scenarios such as progressive rollouts and automated cloud environment provisioning. This project functions as a control plane and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering, targeting platform engineers and developers building and managing cloud-native applications on Kubernetes.
