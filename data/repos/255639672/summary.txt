`nvim-dap` is a Neovim plugin implementing a Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) client, enabling debugging capabilities within the Neovim text editor. Its core functionality includes launching and attaching to debug adapters, setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting application state. Built in Lua, it allows developers to debug applications written in various languages for which a Debug Adapter exists. The plugin is designed as an extensible client library, allowing other plugins to extend the debugging experience through improved UI elements and language-specific features.
