nvim-dap is a Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) client implementation written in Lua for Neovim, targeting software developers across multiple programming languages and development domains. It provides a standardized debugging interface that allows developers to launch applications, attach to running processes, set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect application state directly within their Neovim editor environment. The plugin leverages Microsoft's Debug Adapter Protocol specification to communicate with language-specific debug adapters, enabling debugging capabilities for any language with DAP support including Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and others. It addresses the core problem of integrated development environment functionality within terminal-based editors, offering features like conditional breakpoints, logpoints, expression evaluation, and REPL integration, making it essential for developers who prefer Neovim for code editing but require robust debugging capabilities.
