This open-source project presents an expandable keyboard PCB (Printed Circuit Board) capable of supporting up to 120 keys. The SU120 is designed for easy trial-and-error assembly, allowing users to create Row-Staggered, Column-Staggerd, Ortholinear, or other layouts keyboards. The project includes hardware data for both the PCB and plate, a guide for ordering PCBs, firmware, and instructions on creating custom layouts. Notably, it supports JIS Kana input method and is licensed under the MIT License. This project caters to individuals interested in keyboard design and customization, offering a versatile foundation for experimenting with various keyboard configurations.
