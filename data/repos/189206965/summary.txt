The SU120 is an open-source modular keyboard PCB system designed for custom mechanical keyboard construction, targeting hardware enthusiasts and keyboard hobbyists. The repository contains PCB design files, firmware configurations for QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard), and plate specifications that enable users to create keyboards with 5-120 keys in various layouts including ortholinear, row-staggered, and column-staggered arrangements. The system uses a modular "biscuit" approach where individual key modules are connected via screws and wires, allowing rapid prototyping and layout experimentation without requiring new PCB designs. Originally developed to address the lack of split JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) layout keyboards, it solves the problem of costly and time-intensive custom keyboard development by providing a flexible, assemblable platform that supports multiple form factors from compact keypads to full-size split keyboards.
