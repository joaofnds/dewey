This repository provides a comprehensive collection of customizable themes and configurations for Rofi, a Linux window switcher and application launcher that serves as a dmenu replacement. Built primarily with Shell scripts and CSS-like configuration files (RASI), it offers over 100 pre-designed launchers, applets, and power menus across multiple visual styles and color schemes. The project targets Linux desktop users, system administrators, and window manager enthusiasts who use tiling window managers like i3wm, bspwm, AwesomeWM, or Openbox on distributions such as Arch Linux, Ubuntu, and Fedora. It solves the problem of creating visually appealing and functional application launchers and system menus without requiring users to manually write complex Rofi configurations, providing an ecosystem of interconnected themes that can be easily installed and customized through provided setup scripts.
