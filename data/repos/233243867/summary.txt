Org-fc is a spaced repetition system implemented in Emacs Lisp that integrates with org-mode to create flashcard-based learning tools within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. The system transforms org-mode headlines into reviewable flashcards using spaced repetition algorithms that calculate optimal review intervals based on user performance and memory retention patterns. Targeting knowledge workers, students, researchers, and Emacs power users who rely on org-mode for personal knowledge management, org-fc addresses the problem of systematic knowledge retention and review scheduling. The implementation leverages org-mode's hierarchical document structure and Emacs' extensibility to provide a native learning solution that integrates seamlessly with existing note-taking and documentation workflows, eliminating the need for external flashcard applications.
