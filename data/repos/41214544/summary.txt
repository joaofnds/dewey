XMonad is a tiling window manager for the X11 windowing system, designed to maximize screen utilization by automatically arranging windows without gaps or overlap. Written and configured in Haskell, it provides keyboard-driven window management, with optional mouse support, and supports customization via user-defined layouts, keybindings, and extensions. This project comprises the core `xmonad` package, a small yet extensible library, and leverages `xmonad-contrib` for community-maintained extensions. It functions as a standalone application, enabling developers to create and configure their own X11 window management environment.
