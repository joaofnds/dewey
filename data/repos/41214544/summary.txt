XMonad is a tiling window manager for X11 systems, implemented entirely in Haskell. It targets Linux/Unix desktop environments where users require efficient screen real estate management through automatic window tiling without gaps or overlap. The system emphasizes keyboard-driven navigation over mouse interaction and provides ICCCM compliance for proper X11 integration. Built using functional programming principles, XMonad offers a minimal core with extensive customization capabilities through Haskell configuration files, allowing users to define custom layout algorithms, key bindings, and extensions. It supports Xinerama for multi-monitor setups and targets system administrators, power users, and developers who prefer programmatic desktop environment configuration over traditional GUI-based window managers.
