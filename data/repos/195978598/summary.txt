`emacs-tree-sitter/elisp-tree-sitter` provides Emacs Lisp bindings for the tree-sitter incremental parsing library, enabling structural understanding of code within Emacs. This Emacs package allows for enhanced code highlighting, flexible code folding, structural editing akin to Paredit, and improved indexing for imenu, targeting developers working within the Emacs text editor. It is implemented in Emacs Lisp, leveraging Rust for the core dynamic module and depending on the tree-sitter library, potentially requiring NodeJS for grammar compilation.  It is a developer productivity tool intended to extend the capabilities of the Emacs editor.
