This repository provides Emacs Lisp bindings for tree-sitter, an incremental parsing library, enabling structural code analysis within the Emacs text editor. Built with Rust dynamic modules and targeting software developers using Emacs for code editing, it serves as foundational infrastructure for advanced text editor features like fine-grained syntax highlighting, code folding, structural editing, and improved code indexing. The project bridges tree-sitter's parsing capabilities with Emacs Lisp, supporting development workflows across multiple programming languages through grammar compilation and AST-based code understanding. While superseded by Emacs 29's built-in tree-sitter integration, it demonstrates cross-language FFI implementation using Rust, JavaScript DSL for grammar generation, and dynamic module architecture for extending Emacs functionality.
