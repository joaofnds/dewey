This Go library provides language bindings for Google's Protocol Buffers, enabling serialization and deserialization of structured data. It includes packages for protobuf message operations (cloning, merging, serialization), JSON conversion, and generation of Go code from `.proto` files via the `protoc-gen-go` plugin. The project facilitates the definition and exchange of data structures, particularly targeting developers working with distributed systems and data-intensive applications within the Go ecosystem. This is a library providing utilities and code generation support.
