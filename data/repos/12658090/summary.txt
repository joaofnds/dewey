npm-check-updates is a TypeScript-based CLI tool and Node.js module designed for JavaScript/Node.js developers to manage package dependency updates in web development projects. It analyzes package.json files to identify newer versions of dependencies beyond what current semantic versioning constraints allow, while preserving existing version range operators (^, ~, >, etc.). The tool supports multiple package managers including npm, yarn, pnpm, deno, and bun, and provides features like interactive upgrade selection, dependency filtering with regex/wildcards, and configurable upgrade targets (patch, minor, major, or semver-compliant). It addresses the common DevOps challenge of keeping project dependencies current while maintaining version policy compliance, offering both programmatic API access and command-line interface for integration into development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
