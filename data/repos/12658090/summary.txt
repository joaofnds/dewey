`npm-check-updates` is a TypeScript-based command-line tool designed to identify and update outdated package dependencies within a `package.json` file. It operates within the developer productivity domain, streamlining the process of dependency management for npm, yarn, pnpm, deno, and bun projects. The tool scans the `package.json` file, compares installed package versions against available versions, and facilitates upgrading dependencies to the latest versions while preserving semantic versioning policies. Functionality includes interactive mode for selective updates, filtering capabilities with wildcard and regex support, and a doctor mode for identifying and resolving breaking changes. It provides options for both CLI and programmatic usage, targeting JavaScript/TypeScript developers managing Node.js projects.
