semantic-release is a DevOps automation tool built in JavaScript that fully automates software package release workflows by analyzing commit messages to determine semantic version numbers, generate changelogs, and publish packages. It enforces Semantic Versioning (SemVer) specification by parsing structured commit messages following Angular conventions to automatically determine patch, minor, or major version increments. The tool integrates with CI/CD pipelines and supports multiple package managers through a plugin architecture, enabling automated publishing to npm, GitHub releases, and other distribution channels. Targeted at software developers and DevOps engineers, it eliminates manual version management errors and ensures consistent release practices across JavaScript/Node.js projects and other supported languages through its extensible plugin system.
