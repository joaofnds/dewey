`semantic-release` is a JavaScript library automating the entire package release workflow. It determines the next semantic version, generates release notes, and publishes packages to distribution channels like npm, based on commit message conventions. Employing a plugin architecture, it supports various package managers and CI/CD integrations for fully automated and reproducible releases, targeting JavaScript developers seeking to streamline their software publishing processes using semantic versioning. This is a developer productivity tool (specifically a library) that integrates with CI/CD pipelines.
