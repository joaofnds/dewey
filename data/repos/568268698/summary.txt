The Clipboard Project is a cross-platform command-line clipboard manager written in C++ that provides enhanced clipboard functionality for developers, system administrators, and power users. It operates across Windows, macOS, and Linux, supporting X11 and Wayland display protocols, and integrates with terminal workflows through a scriptable CLI API. The tool addresses limitations of standard system clipboards by enabling multiple named clipboards, persistent history, binary data handling, and file/directory operations. Built with C++20, CMake, OpenSSL, and platform-specific libraries (libx11, libwayland, ALSA), it targets the DevOps and productivity tooling domain, allowing users to programmatically manage clipboard contents through shell scripts and automation workflows while maintaining compatibility with existing GUI clipboard systems.
