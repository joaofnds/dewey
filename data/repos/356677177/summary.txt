Templ is a Go-based HTML templating language and toolchain designed for server-side rendering in web development. It provides a type-safe alternative to traditional string-based templates by allowing developers to write HTML user interfaces directly in Go with full IDE support including syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration. The framework includes a code generator that transforms .templ files into Go code, a command-line tool for formatting and building templates, and comprehensive tooling for modern development workflows. Targeted at Go developers building web applications, templ integrates seamlessly with HTMX for dynamic frontend interactions while maintaining Go's type safety and performance characteristics, solving the problem of runtime template errors and poor developer experience common in traditional HTML templating solutions.
