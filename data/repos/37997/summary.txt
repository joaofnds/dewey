`httparty` is a Ruby library simplifying HTTP requests, enabling developers to interact with web services. It provides both class methods for quick HTTP interactions and a class-based approach for encapsulating API interactions, including features for inspecting response headers, body, and status codes. The library also includes a command-line interface for querying web services and examining the output. As a Ruby library, it targets Ruby developers building applications that consume or interact with web APIs.
