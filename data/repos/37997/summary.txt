HTTParty is a Ruby HTTP client library that simplifies making HTTP requests and consuming web APIs through an intuitive DSL. Targeting web developers building Ruby applications, it abstracts the complexity of Ruby's built-in Net::HTTP library by providing both class-level methods for quick requests and mixin capabilities for building structured API clients. The library handles common HTTP operations like GET/POST requests, automatic JSON/XML parsing, query parameter management, and response object wrapping. It includes a command-line interface for API testing and debugging, making it valuable for both application development and DevOps workflows. HTTParty serves as a lightweight alternative to more complex HTTP clients, focusing on developer productivity when integrating with RESTful web services and third-party APIs in Ruby applications.
