`redaxios` is a JavaScript library providing the Axios API, but implemented as an 800-byte wrapper around the native `fetch()` API. This offers a lightweight alternative to the full Axios library, addressing the need to reduce bundle sizes in web applications while maintaining a familiar and well-regarded API for making HTTP requests. It allows developers to perform HTTP requests, leveraging the functionality described in the official Axios documentation. This is a developer productivity tool aimed at frontend developers and web application developers concerned with optimizing the size of their JavaScript bundles.
