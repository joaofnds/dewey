Redaxios is a lightweight JavaScript HTTP client library that replicates the Axios API interface while using the browser's native Fetch API as its underlying transport mechanism. Targeting web developers working with modern JavaScript frameworks and bundlers like Next.js, Create React App, and Preact CLI, it addresses bundle size optimization concerns by providing the same developer experience as Axios in only 800 bytes compared to Axios's larger footprint. The library serves as a drop-in replacement for Axios in client-side web applications where developers need familiar request/response handling patterns but cannot justify the larger dependency size, particularly useful for performance-sensitive applications requiring HTTP communication with REST APIs while maintaining modern browser compatibility through native fetch support.
