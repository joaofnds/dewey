This repository contains educational materials for "Go in 5 Minutes," a screencast series focused on teaching Go programming language concepts through short-form video tutorials. The project serves the software development education domain, specifically targeting Go developers and programmers learning the language. While the repository language is listed as JavaScript (likely for the website infrastructure), the core content consists of Go code samples, episode outlines, and educational resources organized by episode folders. The repository addresses the need for concise, practical Go programming tutorials covering packages, best practices, and language features. It targets both beginner and intermediate Go developers seeking quick, focused learning content, with accompanying code examples that can be built, tested, and executed using standard Go tooling for hands-on learning experiences.
