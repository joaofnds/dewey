tb-keycast is an Emacs Lisp minor mode that provides real-time keypress visualization within the Emacs tab-bar interface. Designed for the Emacs text editor ecosystem, it displays the last pressed key combination, corresponding function name, and repeat counter in the tab-bar-mode line while intelligently filtering out typing, mouse events, and undefined bindings. The package targets Emacs power users, developers, and content creators who need to demonstrate or monitor their key sequences during coding sessions, tutorials, or presentations. Built specifically for Emacs 29.1+, it integrates with Emacs's native tab-bar-mode system and offers customizable alignment options, addressing the need for unobtrusive keystroke logging and display within the editor environment.
