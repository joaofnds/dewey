JaSerializer is an Elixir library that implements JSON:API specification (jsonapi.org) serialization for web applications, primarily targeting Phoenix framework developers. It provides a DSL-based serializer behavior for transforming Elixir data structures (structs, maps) into compliant JSON:API format, featuring attribute mapping, relationship handling (has_one, has_many), sparse fieldsets, and resource inclusion controls. The library integrates seamlessly with Phoenix views through JaSerializer.PhoenixView, supporting standard REST API patterns with built-in index/show rendering, parameter parsing via JaSerializer.Params, and error handling for changesets. It addresses the need for standardized API response formatting in Elixir web applications, enabling developers to build consistent, specification-compliant REST APIs without manual JSON structure management, particularly valuable for frontend-backend integration and API consumer predictability.
