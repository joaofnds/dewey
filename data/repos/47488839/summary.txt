This Clojure library provides comprehensive Java interoperability for the Java 8 Date-Time API, targeting JVM-based application developers who need robust temporal data handling. It wraps Java 8's `java.time` package classes like `LocalDateTime`, `ZonedDateTime`, `Instant`, and `Period` with idiomatic Clojure functions, eliminating the need for direct Java interop and reflection calls. The library serves as a modern alternative to Joda-Time-based solutions like clj-time, offering consistent APIs for date-time operations, timezone handling, and period calculations. It's designed for Clojure developers building applications requiring precise temporal logic, such as scheduling systems, financial applications, or any domain where accurate time representation and manipulation is critical, while maintaining compatibility with existing Java 8+ codebases.
