`clojure.java-time` is a Clojure library providing a wrapper for the Java 8 Date-Time API. It offers a consistent API for instant, date-time, zone, and period operations, enabling interoperability between Clojure data structures and Java time types while minimizing reflective calls. Key functionalities include creating and manipulating `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, `OffsetDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime` objects, along with conversion capabilities to and from legacy `java.util.Date` and `java.sql` types, and the optional integration with ThreeTen-Extra library. This library is a Clojure library for JVM, targeted at Clojure developers who utilize Java 8+ and desire efficient date and time management within their Clojure projects.
