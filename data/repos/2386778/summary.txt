Idris-dev is the development repository for Idris 1, a general-purpose functional programming language with dependent types, implemented in Haskell. This project provides a compiler, supporting code generation for C and JavaScript, including node.js and browser JavaScript. Primarily a language implementation, it offers a platform for developing software with strong static guarantees, leveraging dependent types for enhanced program correctness, now superseded by Idris 2 development.
