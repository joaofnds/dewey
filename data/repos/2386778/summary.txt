Idris-dev is a compiler implementation for Idris 1, a dependently typed functional programming language targeting research and systems programming domains. Built in Haskell, it provides a complete toolchain including parser, type checker, and code generators for C and JavaScript backends, enabling compilation to native executables and Node.js/browser environments. The language addresses the need for mathematically rigorous software development through dependent types, allowing developers to encode complex invariants and proofs directly in the type system. Primarily used by programming language researchers, functional programming enthusiasts, and developers requiring high-assurance software verification. This represents the legacy Haskell-based implementation, with active development having moved to Idris 2 for next-generation dependently typed programming language features.
