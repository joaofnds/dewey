This repository provides a base16 color scheme template generator for i3status-rust, a status bar component used in i3 window manager environments on Linux systems. It targets system administrators and Linux desktop users who want consistent theming across their desktop environment. The template generates configuration snippets that can be integrated into i3status-rust configurations, automatically applying base16 color schemes to status bar elements. Built upon the Solarized Dark theme foundation, it maps base16 color variables to appropriate status bar components like text, backgrounds, and separators. The solution addresses the lack of built-in theming mechanisms in i3status-rust by providing pre-generated color configurations, enabling users to maintain visual consistency with other base16-themed applications in their Linux desktop workflow without manual color matching.
