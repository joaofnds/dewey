`vim.wasm` is a port of the Vim text editor to WebAssembly, enabling Vim to run within web browsers. It provides nearly all of Vim's core functionalities, including syntax highlighting, Vim script support, and integration with the system clipboard, allowing users to edit text files directly in their browser. Built using Emscripten to compile Vim's C sources to WebAssembly, the project utilizes Web Workers for execution and interacts with the main thread via SharedArrayBuffer, leveraging features like IndexedDB for persistent storage of user configurations and supporting file operations through drag-and-drop or URL fetching. This is a standalone web application intended for developers and power users who value Vim's editing capabilities.
