Rancher is an open-source container management platform built in Go that provides centralized orchestration and administration of Kubernetes clusters across multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Targeting DevOps teams and system administrators in enterprise production environments, it abstracts Kubernetes complexity through a unified management interface for deploying, scaling, and monitoring containerized applications. The platform integrates with Docker containers and provides features like cluster provisioning, RBAC, monitoring, and policy management across on-premises and cloud infrastructure. Rancher addresses the operational challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes distributions and clusters at scale, enabling organizations to standardize container orchestration workflows while meeting enterprise IT requirements for security, compliance, and governance in production container deployments.
