This repository is an archived browser-based generative music platform built with React, Redux, and the Web Audio API through Tone.js. Targeting web audio developers and digital artists, it implements a Progressive Web Application that algorithmically generates and streams ambient music compositions in real-time without user intervention. The platform separates music generation logic (housed in external repositories) from the playback interface, utilizing JavaScript to orchestrate complex audio synthesis and scheduling. It addresses the technical challenge of delivering continuous, non-repetitive musical experiences through web browsers while managing audio sample loading from CDN sources. The codebase serves developers interested in web audio programming, generative art applications, and real-time audio processing using modern web technologies.
