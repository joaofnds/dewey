Fresh is a modern web framework built for the Deno runtime that emphasizes edge computing and performance optimization for web developers. It implements server-side rendering with just-in-time compilation, featuring an island-based architecture that enables selective client-side hydration while maintaining zero JavaScript runtime overhead by default. The framework leverages TypeScript, Preact for UI components, and file-system-based routing similar to Next.js, targeting full-stack web developers building fast, interactive web applications. Fresh addresses the performance bottlenecks of traditional SPAs by shipping minimal client-side JavaScript while preserving interactivity through strategic hydration, making it ideal for developers seeking to build high-performance web applications with modern tooling in the Deno ecosystem without complex configuration requirements.
