Reitit is a high-performance, data-driven routing library for Clojure and ClojureScript web applications. It provides bi-directional URL routing with conflict resolution, pluggable data coercion (malli, schema, clojure.spec), and integrated support for Ring middleware, Pedestal interceptors, and frontend SPA routing. The library features modular architecture with separate packages for OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation, common middleware/interceptors, and development utilities. Reitit addresses the need for fast, declarative route definition using Clojure data structures rather than imperative DSLs, enabling both server-side HTTP APIs and client-side navigation in full-stack Clojure web applications. It targets Clojure web developers building REST APIs, microservices, and single-page applications who require performance-optimized routing with strong data validation capabilities.
