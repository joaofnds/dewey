`tfsec` is a static analysis security scanner for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) written in Go, specifically designed to identify misconfigurations within Terraform templates. It analyzes Terraform code to detect potential security vulnerabilities and compliance violations across major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP. Key functionalities include the evaluation of HCL expressions and Terraform functions, support for modules, configurable output formats (JSON, SARIF, etc.), and integrations with IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and platforms such as GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps. This project is a standalone command-line tool (CLI) targeting DevOps and DevSecOps engineers to improve the security posture of their infrastructure deployments.
