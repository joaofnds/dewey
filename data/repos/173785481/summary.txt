tfsec is a static analysis security scanner specifically designed for Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations, built in Go and targeting DevOps/DevSecOps workflows. It performs comprehensive security misconfiguration detection across major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, DigitalOcean) by analyzing Terraform HCL code, evaluating expressions, functions, and resource relationships to identify potential vulnerabilities and compliance violations. The tool integrates into CI/CD pipelines, supports multiple output formats (JSON, SARIF, CSV), processes both local and remote Terraform modules, and includes hundreds of built-in security rules with custom Rego policy support. Primary users are DevOps engineers, security teams, and infrastructure developers who need automated security validation of Terraform deployments before provisioning cloud resources, though the project has now been consolidated into Aqua Security's broader Trivy security scanning platform.
