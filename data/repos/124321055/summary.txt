Porcupine is an on-device wake word detection engine that uses deep neural networks to enable always-listening voice activation capabilities in applications. Built for embedded systems and IoT devices, it provides cross-platform support across microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, STM32, Arduino), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), web browsers, and desktop systems. The engine is optimized for computational efficiency and low memory footprint, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments like Raspberry Pi and embedded devices. It offers SDKs for multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, Rust, and mobile frameworks like React Native and Flutter. The solution targets developers building voice-enabled applications, smart home devices, and IoT products who need lightweight, offline wake word detection without cloud dependencies, serving as an alternative to cloud-based voice activation services.
