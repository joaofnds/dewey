`bandwhich` is a terminal-based network monitoring utility written in Rust that provides real-time bandwidth utilization analysis for system administrators and DevOps professionals. The tool performs deep packet inspection by sniffing network interfaces and correlates traffic data with running processes using platform-specific APIs (Linux `/proc` filesystem, macOS `lsof`, Windows WinApi). It displays granular network usage statistics organized by process, connection, and remote IP/hostname with automatic reverse DNS resolution. Targeting the network operations and system monitoring domain, bandwhich requires elevated privileges for packet capture capabilities and offers cross-platform support with responsive terminal UI that adapts to window size, making it essential for network troubleshooting and bandwidth analysis workflows.
