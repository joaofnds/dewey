`bandwhich` is a command-line interface (CLI) utility written in Rust for real-time network bandwidth monitoring. It provides a terminal-based dashboard displaying network utilization, categorized by process, connection, and remote IP/hostname.  The application utilizes the `/proc` filesystem on Linux, `lsof` on macOS, and WinApi on Windows for packet sniffing and process association, providing a cross-platform solution. It's a standalone application primarily intended for system administrators and network engineers needing to diagnose network usage.
