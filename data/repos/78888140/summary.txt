DejaVue is a Chrome DevTools extension specifically designed for Vue.js 2.0 application debugging and visualization. Built with JavaScript, it provides frontend developers with comprehensive debugging capabilities including interactive component tree visualization, real-time component inspection (props, variables, slots), diff engine for tracking component updates, and time travel debugging for state management workflows. The tool operates independently of state management libraries like Vuex while providing enhanced integration when present. It addresses the critical need for Vue.js developers to understand component hierarchies, debug state changes, and optimize application performance through visual debugging interfaces. The extension integrates directly into Chrome's developer tools ecosystem, offering component highlighting and stress testing capabilities for Vue.js web applications.
