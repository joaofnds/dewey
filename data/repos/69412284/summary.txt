http-echo is a lightweight Go-based HTTP server designed for development, testing, and DevOps workflows that serves static text content as HTML responses. Built as a minimal web server without external dependencies, it accepts configurable text input via command-line flags and responds to all HTTP requests with that content, running on a configurable port (default 5678). This utility addresses the common need for simple HTTP endpoints during application testing, container orchestration, load balancer configuration, and microservices development. The tool targets software developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who require quick HTTP response mocking, health check endpoints, or basic web service simulation without the overhead of full-featured web frameworks or complex server configurations.
