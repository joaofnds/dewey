Buttercup Desktop is a cross-platform password management application built with Electron and TypeScript, targeting cybersecurity and personal data protection domains. The application implements industry-standard encryption to secure password vaults stored as `.bcup` files, supporting multiple storage backends including local filesystem, Dropbox, Google Drive, and WebDAV services. Built on Node.js 20 LTS, it provides native desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions through Electron's cross-platform framework. The solution addresses password security challenges for end-users, system administrators, and security-conscious individuals who need encrypted credential storage with cloud synchronization capabilities. The codebase leverages TypeScript for type safety and maintainability while implementing vault-based architecture for organizing and encrypting sensitive authentication data across multiple platforms and storage providers.
