speed-test is a Node.js-based CLI tool that provides programmatic internet connectivity testing by interfacing with speedtest.net's infrastructure. Built as an npm package for JavaScript/Node.js environments, it enables automated measurement of download/upload speeds and network latency from command-line interfaces. The tool outputs structured data in JSON format or human-readable text, with configurable units (Mbps/MBps) and verbosity levels. Primarily targeted at DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who need to integrate network performance monitoring into scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or infrastructure automation workflows. It addresses the need for headless, scriptable internet speed testing without requiring browser-based interfaces, making it suitable for server environments, automated monitoring systems, and network diagnostics in development and production environments.
