`adblock-rust` is a high-performance ad-blocking engine written in Rust that implements network request filtering, cosmetic element blocking, and resource replacement for web browsers and privacy tools. Built for the web browsing/privacy domain, it parses and executes AdBlock Plus filter lists, uBlock Origin syntax extensions, and hosts files to block advertisements and trackers. The engine compiles to both native code and WebAssembly, offering Rust, JavaScript, and Python bindings for cross-platform integration. It features optional CSS validation, Apple content-blocking format conversion, and configurable domain resolution. Primary users include browser developers, privacy tool creators, and proxy/filtering service developers who need efficient ad-blocking capabilities integrated into their applications.
