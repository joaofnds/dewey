Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine designed for large-scale data processing and analysis. It provides high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, enabling the development of applications for SQL and DataFrames, pandas API on Spark for pandas workloads, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Structured Streaming for stream processing. Built primarily with Scala, Spark offers an optimized engine supporting general computation graphs and integrates with Hadoop-supported storage systems. It functions as a framework, providing libraries and tools for developers working with big data workloads.
