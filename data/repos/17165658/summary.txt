Apache Spark is a distributed computing engine designed for large-scale data processing and analytics across clusters. Built primarily in Scala with APIs for Java, Python, and R, it targets data engineers, data scientists, and analytics professionals working with big data workloads. The framework provides unified processing capabilities through specialized modules: Spark SQL for structured data queries, MLlib for machine learning pipelines, GraphX for graph computation, and Structured Streaming for real-time data processing. Spark solves the complexity of distributed data processing by abstracting cluster management while offering high-level DataFrame and Dataset APIs, enabling users to perform batch processing, interactive analytics, and stream processing on petabyte-scale datasets across Hadoop clusters, cloud platforms, and standalone deployments.
