`chubin/awesome-console-services` is a curated list, functioning as a developer resource, of console-accessible services reachable via HTTP, HTTPS, and other network protocols. It provides one-line command examples using tools like `curl`, `dig`, and `ssh` to access various services including IP address lookup, geolocation, text sharing, URL shortening, file transfer, and more. Categorized services range from tools and monitoring to entertainment and information boards, showcasing a collection of accessible online resources. The project itself is a curated list presented in a README, and serves as a reference for terminal-based interaction with external services.
