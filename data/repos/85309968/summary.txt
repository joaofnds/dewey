This repository is a curated collection of HTTP-accessible console services designed for command-line operations and terminal-based workflows. It catalogs web services that can be invoked directly via curl, wget, and other CLI tools without requiring GUI applications or complex API authentication. The services span multiple domains including IP geolocation, text sharing (pastebin-style), URL shortening, file transfer, weather data, cryptocurrency prices, DNS lookups, and system monitoring utilities. Targeted at DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who prefer terminal-based workflows, it enables rapid access to web services through simple HTTP requests. The repository addresses the need for lightweight, scriptable alternatives to web-based services, facilitating automation, shell scripting, and remote server administration where GUI tools are unavailable or impractical.
