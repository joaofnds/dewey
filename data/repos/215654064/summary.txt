Temporal is a distributed workflow orchestration platform built in Go that provides durable execution for long-running business processes and microservices coordination. It serves as a fault-tolerant workflow engine that automatically handles retries, timeouts, and state persistence across distributed systems, eliminating the need for developers to implement complex error handling and reliability patterns manually. The platform targets backend developers and DevOps engineers building scalable microservices architectures, particularly for use cases like payment processing, data pipelines, human-in-the-loop processes, and distributed cron jobs. Temporal abstracts away the complexity of distributed systems challenges such as partial failures, service outages, and state management, allowing developers to write business logic as simple sequential code while the platform ensures reliable execution across service boundaries and infrastructure failures.
