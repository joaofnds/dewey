This repository contains the RabbitMQ CLI tools suite, a command-line interface built in Elixir for managing and administering RabbitMQ message broker instances. The tools include rabbitmqctl, rabbitmq-plugins, rabbitmq-diagnostics, rabbitmq-queues, rabbitmq-streams, and rabbitmq-upgrade, all compiled into a single extensible executable that changes behavior based on the invocation name. Built on Erlang/OTP with Elixir, it targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, and backend developers who need to manage RabbitMQ clusters, configure messaging infrastructure, monitor broker health, and perform operational tasks. The CLI implements a plugin-extensible architecture with configurable output formats, comprehensive testing, and follows the CommandBehaviour pattern for adding new administrative commands to the RabbitMQ ecosystem.
