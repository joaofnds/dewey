This Elixir-based repository provides command-line tools for interacting with RabbitMQ, a message broker. The `rabbitmq-cli` tools include `rabbitmqctl`, `rabbitmq-plugins`, and `rabbitmq-diagnostics`, enabling users to manage and inspect RabbitMQ instances, plugins, and diagnostics information.  The project leverages Elixir and relies on the rabbitmq-common and Erlang/OTP runtime environment for functionality, producing standalone executables.  The CLI tools are designed to be extensible with plugins and support pluggable output formats, targeting system administrators and developers working with RabbitMQ deployments.
