roBa is a wireless split mechanical keyboard project targeting custom keyboard enthusiasts and ergonomic typing users. Built as a 42-key column-staggered split keyboard inspired by keyball designs, it integrates a trackball and horizontal rotary encoder for enhanced input functionality. The keyboard utilizes ZMK firmware for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity, featuring configurable layers including auto-mouse and scroll modes with 400 CPI trackball sensitivity. The project provides PCB designs, build guides, and firmware configurations for DIY keyboard builders, with assembly kits available through BOOTH marketplace. Key technical components include the CKW12 rotary encoder (v2+), ZMK-based firmware customization, and wireless connectivity targeting developers and professionals seeking ergonomic input solutions with integrated pointing device functionality.
