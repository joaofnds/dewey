This GitHub repository, named kumamuk-git/roBa, presents a wireless keyboard inspired by the keyball project. It boasts distinctive features such as Bluetooth (BLE) compatibility through ZMK firmware, a split column staggered key array (42 keys), an integrated trackball, and a horizontal rotary encoder (v1: evqwgd001, v2 onwards: CKW12). The keyboard is available for purchase at [BOOTH](https://kumamuk.booth.pm/). A build guide can be found in the doc/v3/buildguide_v3.md file, and the firmware repository is located at [kumamuk-git/zmk-config-roBa](https://github.com/kumamuk-git/zmk-config-roBa). The default configuration includes four auto-mouse layers, a scroll layer, and a CPI of 400. Users can edit the firmware and key map using the provided build guide or ZMK STUDIO. This project is primarily useful for individuals seeking an advanced wireless keyboard solution with unique features.
