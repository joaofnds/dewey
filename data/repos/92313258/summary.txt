cert-manager is a Kubernetes-native certificate lifecycle management system written in Go that automates TLS certificate provisioning, renewal, and distribution within Kubernetes clusters. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform administrators, it extends Kubernetes with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for certificates and certificate issuers, integrating with multiple Certificate Authorities including Let's Encrypt ACME, HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi. The system automatically handles certificate lifecycle operations, monitoring expiration dates and performing renewals to prevent service outages. It seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes Ingress controllers and other TLS-enabled workloads, eliminating manual certificate management overhead in cloud-native environments and ensuring continuous certificate validity across distributed applications.
