Ignite is a production-ready React Native boilerplate and CLI toolkit designed for mobile application development, specifically targeting React Native and Expo projects. Built with TypeScript, it provides a comprehensive foundation including React Navigation for routing, MobX-State-Tree for state management, and integrated Expo SDK components for fonts, localization, and device APIs. The framework includes code generators for components and models, reducing initial project setup time by 2-4 weeks according to usage reports. Maintained continuously since 2016 by Infinite Red, it serves React Native developers who need a battle-tested starting point with pre-configured tooling, established architectural patterns, and proven technical decisions for cross-platform mobile app development, eliminating the need to make foundational technology choices and configuration decisions from scratch.
