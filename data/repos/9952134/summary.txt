`folium` is a Python library designed for data visualization on interactive Leaflet.js maps. It facilitates the creation of web-based map visualizations, enabling users to display geospatial data, such as points, lines, and polygons, alongside interactive elements. Built on Python, the library leverages JavaScript (Leaflet.js) for front-end map rendering, offering features including marker clustering, heatmaps, and various map tile providers. This data science focused project provides a powerful means of visualizing geographic data within a Python environment.
