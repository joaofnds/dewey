**Folium** is a Python library that serves as a bridge between Python's data manipulation ecosystem and Leaflet.js for creating interactive web maps. Targeted at data scientists and geospatial analysts, it enables users to process geospatial data using Python's pandas, numpy, and geopandas libraries, then render the results as interactive HTML/JavaScript maps powered by Leaflet.js. The library addresses the common workflow challenge of visualizing geospatial data analysis results in web-compatible formats without requiring direct JavaScript programming. Folium supports various map layers, markers, choropleth maps, and geographic data overlays, making it essential for location-based data visualization, geographic information systems (GIS) analysis, and spatial data science applications where Python-processed data needs to be presented as interactive web maps.
