`jo` is a C-based command-line utility designed to generate JSON output from shell commands. It enables the creation of JSON objects and arrays directly from the command line, facilitating the transformation of shell script results into structured JSON data. This standalone application simplifies the process of integrating shell scripts with systems that require JSON inputs. The tool uses a small subset of C to implement its features and is built using standard GNU build tools such as autoconf and automake. Its primary function is to serve as a developer productivity tool.
