`jo` is a lightweight C utility for generating JSON objects and arrays from shell command lines, primarily targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and shell script developers. The tool converts command-line key-value pairs into properly formatted JSON output, enabling seamless integration between shell scripts and JSON-consuming APIs or applications. Built using standard C with autotools (autoconf/automake) for cross-platform compilation, it supports both object creation via key=value syntax and array generation from piped input. The utility addresses the common problem of constructing valid JSON within shell environments without requiring heavy dependencies like Node.js or Python, making it particularly valuable for containerized environments, CI/CD pipelines, and system automation scripts where minimal footprint and reliable JSON generation are essential.
