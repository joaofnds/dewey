DevDocs is a client-side JavaScript web application that aggregates and serves API documentation from multiple sources through a unified interface. Built on Ruby with Sinatra/Sprockets backend and Thor-based scraping infrastructure, it targets web developers needing centralized access to technical reference materials. The system combines a Ruby documentation scraper that extracts and normalizes content from various APIs with a Progressive Web App (PWA) frontend offering offline support, instant search, and keyboard navigation. It addresses the fragmentation of developer documentation across different platforms by providing a consistent, searchable interface for API references, reducing context switching between different documentation sites and formats during software development workflows.
