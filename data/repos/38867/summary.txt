The rails-i18n repository is a centralized Ruby gem that provides comprehensive locale data for Ruby on Rails internationalization (i18n) functionality. It serves Rails web developers by offering pre-configured translation files, pluralization rules, transliteration mappings, and ordinal number formatting for over 100 locales across multiple Rails versions (3.x through 8.x). The gem integrates directly with Rails' I18n API, allowing developers to easily localize applications without manually creating locale files for each supported language. It addresses the common problem of implementing multilingual Rails applications by providing standardized, community-maintained locale data including ActiveRecord error messages, date/time formats, and currency representations. Target users are Rails developers building internationalized web applications who need reliable, ready-to-use localization data rather than creating custom translations from scratch.
