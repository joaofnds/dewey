evil-magit is an Emacs Lisp integration library that provides Vim-style keybindings for Magit, the popular Git interface for Emacs. It bridges the gap between Evil mode (Vim emulation in Emacs) and Magit by implementing a comprehensive keybinding scheme that allows developers to use familiar Vim navigation and commands within Magit's Git workflow interface. The package addresses the conflict between Evil's modal editing paradigm and Magit's default keybindings, enabling seamless Git operations like staging, committing, branching, and diffing using Vim-like keys. Targeted at Emacs developers who prefer Vim-style editing but need robust Git integration, it supports features like visual selection for yanking text, customizable movement keys, and a toggle-able text mode for arbitrary buffer navigation. The project has been deprecated and merged into the broader evil-collection package.
