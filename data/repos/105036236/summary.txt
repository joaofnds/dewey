`Shopify/draggable` is a JavaScript library providing a comprehensive API for implementing drag-and-drop functionality in web applications. It abstracts native browser events to facilitate custom drag-and-drop experiences, including modules for sorting (Sortable), dropping (Droppable), and swapping (Swappable) elements. Built on ES6, the library features drag detection through sensor integration (mouse, touch, force touch), a mirror element for drag representation, and is designed for frontend developers seeking fine-grained control over drag-and-drop interactions, offering a customizable and extensible approach. This project functions as a JavaScript library with accompanying TypeScript definitions, catering to the needs of interactive web development.
