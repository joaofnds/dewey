Shopify Draggable is a comprehensive JavaScript library for implementing drag-and-drop interactions in web applications, targeting front-end developers building interactive user interfaces. Built with ES6 modules, it abstracts native browser events (mouse, touch, force touch) into a unified API and provides four core components: Draggable (base functionality), Sortable (reordering elements), Droppable (drag-to-target interactions), and Swappable (element swapping). The library solves cross-browser compatibility issues for drag-and-drop functionality while offering extensible sensor detection, event lifecycle hooks, and plugin architecture. At 16.2kB bundle size, it enables developers to create custom drag-and-drop experiences without dealing with complex native browser event handling, making it suitable for e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and any web application requiring intuitive element manipulation interfaces.
