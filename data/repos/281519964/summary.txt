Medley is a complete Lisp programming environment that revives the classic Interlisp system originally developed at Xerox PARC. Built on a virtual machine architecture (Maiko VM implemented in C), it provides both Interlisp and Common Lisp runtime environments with integrated development tools, graphical user interface, and persistent virtual memory system. The project targets programming language researchers, Lisp enthusiasts, and developers interested in historical computing systems or symbolic AI development. It runs on modern platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL) using X11 for display management, offering features like live image-based development, integrated editor, and automatic system state persistence. This system serves as both a functional Lisp development environment and a preservation effort for significant computer science heritage.
