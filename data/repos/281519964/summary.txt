`Medley` is the primary repository for the Medley Interlisp environment, a Lisp implementation. This project encompasses the core Lisp system, including sources, build scripts, documentation, and early implementations of Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).  It provides an interactive Lisp environment with a virtual machine component implemented in C (Maiko, a separate repository). Users can run and extend this system, including loading and saving system states, and access associated tools. Primarily, this is a standalone, Common Lisp-based system, with dependencies on an X-Server for display and a virtual machine for execution, targeting Lisp developers and researchers.
