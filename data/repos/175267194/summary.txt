fennel.vim is a Vim plugin that provides syntax highlighting support for the Fennel programming language, a Lisp dialect that compiles to Lua. Built using Vim script and heavily modified from vim-clojure-static, this plugin enables proper code visualization and editing experience for Fennel source files within the Vim text editor. It targets functional programming developers and Lisp enthusiasts working with Fennel for game development, scripting, or embedded systems where Lua is commonly used. The plugin integrates with popular Vim package managers including Vundle, vim-plug, and Pathogen, solving the core problem of lacking native syntax highlighting for Fennel code in Vim environments. This tool is essential for developers who prefer Vim as their primary editor while working on Fennel projects that leverage Lua's lightweight runtime.
