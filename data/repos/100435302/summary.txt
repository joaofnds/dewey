Eglot is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) client implementation for GNU Emacs written in Emacs Lisp, targeting software developers across multiple programming languages. It integrates LSP servers with Emacs's built-in features including Flymake for diagnostics, ElDoc for documentation, Xref for navigation, and Project for workspace management. The package provides IDE-like functionality including code completion, error checking, symbol navigation, refactoring, and hover documentation for languages like Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Rust, Go, Java, and dozens of others. Eglot emphasizes minimal configuration and seamless integration with existing Emacs workflows, automatically detecting projects and starting appropriate language servers. Now included in Emacs core (v29+), it serves as a lightweight alternative to more complex LSP clients, enabling cross-language development tooling for Emacs users without requiring extensive setup or external dependencies.
