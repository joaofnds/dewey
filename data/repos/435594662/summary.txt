Nyoom.nvim is a Neovim configuration framework written in Fennel (a Lisp that compiles to Lua) designed as an alternative to Doom Emacs for developers seeking a fast, modular text editor setup. It targets software developers across domains who want a highly customizable IDE-like experience with minimal abstraction over vanilla Neovim. The framework provides a modular architecture with curated plugin configurations, declarative package management via Packer.nvim, language server protocol (LSP) integration, tree-sitter syntax highlighting, and telescope-powered project search utilities. It solves the problem of complex, over-abstracted editor configurations by offering intuitive Lisp macros, a standard library, and a Space(vim)-style keybinding scheme while maintaining close-to-metal performance and extensibility for developers who prefer functional programming paradigms in their editor configuration.
