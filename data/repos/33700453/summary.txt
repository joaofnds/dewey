RDM is a macOS system utility written in Objective-C++ that enables users to configure Retina displays at higher unsupported resolutions beyond Apple's default limitations. The tool provides a menu bar interface for accessing extended display resolution options, including HiDPI modes with 2x pixel density scaling. It addresses the limitation where MacBook Pro Retina displays are artificially restricted to lower maximum resolutions (e.g., 1680×1050 on 13" models) despite hardware capability for much higher resolutions (up to 3360×2100). The application targets power users, developers, and professionals who require maximum screen real estate for productivity workflows. RDM integrates with macOS display management APIs and can be configured as a login item for automatic startup, providing persistent access to enhanced display resolution configurations.
