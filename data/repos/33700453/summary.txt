RDM is a standalone GUI application for macOS, enabling users to set Retina display resolutions beyond the manufacturer's supported limits. Developed in Objective-C++, the software provides a menu bar interface to select from a range of custom resolutions, including HiDPI options. It addresses the user need for finer control over display settings on Retina MacBook Pros, facilitating the utilization of higher pixel densities. This project focuses on user convenience, offering an installable package and automatic startup configuration.
