This repository demonstrates a technique for styling GitHub README files using CSS embedded within SVG images, bypassing GitHub's restriction on direct CSS styling in markdown. The solution targets web developers and open-source maintainers who want to create visually enhanced project documentation beyond standard markdown formatting. By leveraging SVG's ability to contain CSS and HTML through foreignObject elements, developers can implement custom typography, layouts, colors, and responsive design in their repository README files. The technique uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, SVG) and works within GitHub's content security policies, solving the problem of limited visual customization options for project presentation and branding in repository documentation.
