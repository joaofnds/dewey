The `cncf/landscape` repository provides the data and assets for generating the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Landscape, an interactive map of cloud-native projects and products. It functions as a data source for the landscape website, including the `landscape.yml` file used for cataloging entries and SVG logos.  This repository focuses on organizing and presenting information about cloud-native technologies, including details sourced from Crunchbase and GitHub. It's a data and asset repository primarily focused on visualization and categorization of cloud-native technologies for developers, companies and the wider CNCF community.
