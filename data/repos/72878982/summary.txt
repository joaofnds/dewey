The CNCF Cloud Native Landscape is a comprehensive data repository and visualization system that maps and categorizes cloud native technologies, projects, and products in the Kubernetes/container ecosystem. It serves as a centralized directory for DevOps engineers, platform architects, and cloud infrastructure teams to discover and evaluate cloud native solutions across categories like orchestration, service mesh, observability, and storage. The system integrates data from GitHub (stars, commits, contributors) and Crunchbase (funding, company information) to provide technical metrics and organizational details. Built around a YAML configuration file (landscape.yml) with SVG logos, it's rendered by the landscape2 generator and organized by CNCF Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs). The landscape addresses the problem of navigating the complex, rapidly-evolving cloud native technology space by providing a structured, searchable interface for comparing hundreds of CNCF projects and commercial offerings.
