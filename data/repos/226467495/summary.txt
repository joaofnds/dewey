termenv is a Go library that provides advanced ANSI styling and color support for terminal applications, specifically targeting CLI tool developers and TUI (Terminal User Interface) creators. It abstracts the complexity of ANSI escape sequences by automatically detecting terminal capabilities (ASCII, 16-color ANSI, 256-color, or 24-bit TrueColor) and gracefully degrading colors across profiles. The library offers comprehensive terminal control including RGB color management, text styling (bold, italic, underline), cursor positioning, screen manipulation, mouse tracking, and clipboard operations. It solves the cross-terminal compatibility problem by providing a unified API that works consistently across different terminal emulators while respecting environment variables like NO_COLOR. The library targets Go developers building command-line interfaces, developer tools, system administration utilities, and interactive terminal applications requiring rich visual output and precise terminal control.
