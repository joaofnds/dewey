`termenv` is a Go library providing advanced ANSI style and color support for terminal applications, designed to simplify the handling of terminal output formatting. It enables the use of features like RGB/TrueColor, color profile detection, and chainable syntax for styling output, including colors, bolding, and underlining, eliminating the need to manually manage ANSI escape sequences. The library offers helper functions for Go templates, screen manipulation, and session control, and supports features such as bracketed paste and mouse tracking modes, making it a developer productivity tool primarily targeted at developers building command-line interfaces (CLIs) or terminal user interfaces (TUIs) in Go. It also provides compatibility information regarding the color and features supported by different terminals.
