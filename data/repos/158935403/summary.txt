**dispwatch** is an Emacs Lisp package that provides automated display configuration monitoring for Emacs users working across multiple monitor setups. The package continuously monitors display properties (resolution, physical dimensions, work area) and triggers customizable hooks when changes are detected, such as connecting or disconnecting external monitors. Built specifically for the Emacs text editor ecosystem and distributed via MELPA, it enables developers and power users to automatically adjust editor configurations like font sizes, window layouts, and UI settings based on current display geometry. The package implements a simple polling mechanism with `dispwatch-mode` for activation and accepts hook functions that receive display resolution as coordinate pairs, making it particularly valuable for laptop users who frequently switch between docked and mobile workstation configurations in software development environments.
