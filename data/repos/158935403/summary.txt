`dispwatch` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to monitor display configuration changes, such as monitor plugging/unplugging. It provides a mechanism to execute a user-defined hook function upon detecting changes in display resolution or dimensions. Users can utilize `dispwatch-mode` to activate or deactivate the monitoring functionality, and hook functions receive the display's pixel width and height. This is a library intended for Emacs users seeking to automate actions based on display changes, a developer productivity tool.
