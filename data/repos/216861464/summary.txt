Rethink is a CSS stylesheet theme specifically designed for Emacs Org mode HTML exports, targeting technical documentation and content presentation. Built using professional web development CSS techniques, it provides styling for LaTeX mathematical expressions, syntax-highlighted code blocks, lists, and tables commonly found in technical writing. The theme integrates with Org mode's HTML export functionality and requires configuration of `org-html-htmlize-output-type` to properly render syntax highlighting through CSS classes. It addresses the need for clean, professional-looking web presentations of technical documentation authored in Org mode, serving developers, technical writers, and academics who use Emacs for document preparation and want polished HTML output without complex theming overhead.
