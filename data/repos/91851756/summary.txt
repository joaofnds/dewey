This deprecated repository, `docker-archive/docker-ce`, served as a unification point for open-source components of Docker CE products, specifically the Docker Engine and CLI. Written in Go, it previously aggregated code from upstream Git repositories, primarily `moby/moby` and `docker/cli`, into a unified directory structure. The master branch unified these components, while release branches corresponded to product versions. This repository, now archived, was a build and integration point, allowing contributors to submit fixes for specific components. Its features directly supported the creation and maintenance of Docker CE releases.
