This deprecated Go-based repository served as the unified source repository for Docker CE (Community Edition) packaging and distribution in the DevOps/containerization domain. It functioned as an integration hub that combined upstream components from separate Docker repositories (moby/moby for Docker Engine and docker/cli for Docker CLI) into a single codebase using the moby-components tool for building Docker CE releases. The repository managed time-based release branching (YY.MM format), cherry-picked fixes across components, and maintained release tags for distribution to system administrators and DevOps engineers. Starting with Docker 20.10, this centralized approach was abandoned in favor of building packages directly from their respective upstream repositories, making this repository obsolete while Docker CE itself remains actively developed.
