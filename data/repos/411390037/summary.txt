Frowny.el is an Emacs Lisp package that modifies text input behavior in the Emacs editor to enable proper insertion of emoticon characters like ":(" and ":)" without interference from automatic parentheses-pairing modes such as electric-pair-mode and paredit-mode. The package provides a minor mode that uses regex pattern matching and the `looking-back` function to detect when a left parenthesis follows emoticon "eyes" (colons, equals signs, or dashes) and prevents automatic closing parenthesis insertion in those contexts. Targeted at Emacs users and developers who frequently use text-based communication modes like IRC or chat within their editor environment, it solves the specific problem of unwanted paired parentheses disrupting emoticon syntax in modes where automatic bracket completion is otherwise desired for code editing.
