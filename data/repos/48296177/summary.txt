libfuse is a C library providing a userspace interface to the Linux kernel's FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) module. It enables the development of custom filesystems by allowing userspace programs to export them to the kernel. The library provides both high-level synchronous and low-level asynchronous APIs for handling kernel requests, mounting/unmounting filesystems, and sending responses. This project is a library and is primarily used by developers who need to create custom filesystem implementations on Linux and, to a lesser extent, BSD systems. It relies on Meson and Ninja for build automation.
