libfuse is the reference userspace library implementation for Linux FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace), enabling developers to create custom filesystems that run in userspace while integrating with the Linux kernel's VFS layer. Written in C, it provides both high-level synchronous and low-level asynchronous APIs for handling kernel filesystem requests through callbacks, supporting operations like mount/unmount, inode management, and request/response communication. The library targets systems programmers, filesystem developers, and infrastructure engineers building specialized storage solutions, distributed filesystems, or custom file access layers. It solves the complexity of kernel-userspace communication for filesystem operations, allowing developers to implement filesystems without kernel module development. The project uses Meson/Ninja for building and includes the setuid fusermount3 utility for secure user-level filesystem mounting across Linux distributions.
