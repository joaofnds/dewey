emacs-libvterm is a high-performance terminal emulator for GNU Emacs that integrates the libvterm C library to provide full terminal compatibility within the Emacs editor environment. Targeting software developers and system administrators who use Emacs as their primary development environment, it solves the performance and compatibility limitations of Emacs' built-in terminal solutions (eshell, shell, term) by leveraging compiled C code instead of Emacs Lisp. The package requires Emacs with dynamic module support, cmake, and libtool-bin, delivering seamless handling of interactive command-line applications like htop, ncdu, and other ncurses-based tools that don't work properly with traditional Emacs terminal implementations. It addresses the critical gap between terminal functionality and editor integration for Emacs-centric development workflows.
