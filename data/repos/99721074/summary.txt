`emacs-libvterm` integrates the `libvterm` terminal emulator into GNU Emacs, providing a performant, fully-featured terminal experience within the editor. Written in Emacs Lisp with a C backend via `libvterm`, it supports standard command-line tools and interactive applications, surpassing the capabilities of built-in Emacs terminals like `term`. Key functionalities include `vterm-copy-mode` for text manipulation, directory and prompt tracking via shell integration, and message passing for executing Emacs Lisp commands. This is a plugin/extension for Emacs targeting Emacs users who desire a more capable and efficient terminal emulator within their editing environment.
