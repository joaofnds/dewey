Serapeum is a conservative utility library for Common Lisp that extends the language's standard library and complements Alexandria with additional functional programming utilities. Targeting Common Lisp developers, it provides sequence manipulation functions, string processing utilities, CLOS enhancements, internal definition macros, compile-time exhaustiveness checking for enums and union types, and binding mechanisms for the function namespace. The library emphasizes portable implementations across SBCL and Clozure CL, offering features borrowed from other functional languages and Lisp dialects. It serves as a comprehensive toolkit for Lisp programmers building applications requiring advanced sequence operations, metaprogramming capabilities, and enhanced object-oriented programming constructs, while maintaining compatibility with existing Common Lisp codebases and the Quicklisp ecosystem.
