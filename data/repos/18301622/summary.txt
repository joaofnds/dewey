`Serapeum` is a Common Lisp utility library designed to augment, rather than replace, the Alexandria library, filling gaps in the language with a focus on practicality and portability. It provides a collection of functions and macros, including sequence manipulation tools like `runs`, `batches`, `assort`, and `partitions`, as well as features for binding values in the function namespace (`fbind`, `fbind*`, `defalias`), and internal definitions (`local`, `local*`, `block-compile`) to aid in modular code organization and compilation. Serapeum also includes compile-time exhaustiveness checking for type cases (`etypecase-of`, `ecase-of`, etc.) and CLOS extensions such as a `standard/context` method combination and a `topmost-object-class` metaclass for streamlined class definitions. This library is intended for Common Lisp developers and seeks to improve developer productivity and code quality through enhanced language tools.
