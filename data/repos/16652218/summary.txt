Overleaf is an open-source, web-based application providing a real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. It enables users to create, edit, and collaborate on LaTeX documents within a web browser, addressing the need for collaborative scientific writing and document preparation. The project comprises both a community edition and a commercially supported "Server Pro" version, with installation and upgrade instructions provided.  Built using JavaScript (implicitly through the web application context) and leveraging Docker for containerization, Overleaf facilitates document creation and collaboration through its online platform.
