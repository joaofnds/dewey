Overleaf is an open-source web-based collaborative LaTeX editor built with JavaScript that enables real-time document editing and collaboration for academic and technical writing. The platform targets researchers, academics, and technical writers who need to create scientific papers, mathematical documents, and technical publications using LaTeX markup language. The system is containerized using Docker with a multi-layered architecture including a base image with TeX Live dependencies and a community image containing the core Overleaf services, managed through runit service manager and Phusion baseimage. It solves the problem of collaborative LaTeX document creation by providing a browser-based alternative to desktop LaTeX editors, eliminating the need for local LaTeX installations while supporting multiple users editing documents simultaneously with version control and real-time synchronization capabilities.
