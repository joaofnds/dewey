Trix is a WYSIWYG rich text editor built for web applications using modern JavaScript and Web Components standards including Custom Elements, Element Internals, and Mutation Observer APIs. Designed for web developers, it addresses the cross-browser inconsistencies and bugs inherent in native `contenteditable` and `execCommand` APIs by implementing an internal document model that intercepts user input, processes it through editing operations, and re-renders clean HTML output. The editor supports embedded attachments, provides a customizable toolbar interface, and integrates as a `<trix-editor>` custom element that can be easily embedded in web applications. Distributed in ESM and UMD formats, Trix targets frontend developers building content management systems, messaging platforms, and web applications requiring reliable rich text editing capabilities across all modern browsers.
