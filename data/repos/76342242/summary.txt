Rough.js is a JavaScript graphics library designed for creating hand-drawn or sketchy-style graphics within web applications. It provides primitives for drawing lines, curves, arcs, polygons, circles, ellipses, and SVG paths, offering both Canvas and SVG rendering backends. The library supports various fill styles and a "sketching style" through configurable roughness and bowing parameters, enabling unique visual effects. Primarily a frontend library, it is intended for use by web developers seeking to incorporate stylized, hand-drawn aesthetics into their projects.
