Rough.js is a lightweight (<9 kB) JavaScript graphics library for web development that renders geometric primitives (lines, curves, arcs, polygons, circles, ellipses) and SVG paths with a hand-drawn, sketchy aesthetic. The library targets both HTML5 Canvas and SVG rendering contexts, providing developers with programmatic control over visual styling parameters including roughness, bowing, fill patterns (hachure, cross-hatch, dots, zigzag), and stroke properties. Built for front-end web developers creating interactive visualizations, diagrams, or artistic graphics applications, Rough.js solves the problem of generating organic, human-like drawing effects in web browsers without requiring manual artwork. The library supports multiple module formats (CommonJS, ESM, IIFE) and integrates with existing Canvas/SVG workflows, making it suitable for data visualization tools, drawing applications, and creative web interfaces.
