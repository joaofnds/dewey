`org-appear` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to enhance user interaction with Org mode documents by dynamically controlling the visibility of element parts. Its core function is to toggle the display of hidden Org mode elements, such as subtrees or properties, upon the cursor entering or leaving those elements. This functionality improves focus and navigability within complex Org mode files, functioning as a developer productivity tool specifically for Emacs users who extensively utilize Org mode for note-taking, task management, and outlining. It is a plugin/extension for the Emacs text editor.
