`org-appear` is an Emacs Lisp package that provides dynamic visibility toggling for hidden elements in Org mode documents. The package automatically reveals concealed markup elements like emphasis markers, links, subscripts/superscripts, LaTeX entities, and keywords when the cursor enters them, then hides them again upon exit. It leverages Org mode's existing visibility controls (`org-hide-emphasis-markers`, `org-link-descriptive`, `org-pretty-entities`) and the `org-element` API for element detection, offering configurable triggers (always, on-change, manual) and integration hooks for modal editors like Evil mode. This tool addresses the limitation of Org mode's global-only visibility settings by enabling context-sensitive, element-by-element revelation of markup syntax. It targets Emacs users, technical writers, researchers, and developers who frequently work with Org mode documents and need improved editing ergonomics without sacrificing clean document presentation.
