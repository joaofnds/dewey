El Gantt is an Emacs Lisp package that generates interactive Gantt charts from Org Mode files, targeting productivity-focused developers and project managers who use Emacs for task management. Built on the org-ql query library along with ts.el, s.el, and dash.el dependencies, it transforms org-mode scheduled items, deadlines, and timestamps into visual project timelines. The tool addresses the gap between text-based org-mode task tracking and visual project scheduling by providing customizable calendar views with features like date manipulation, timeline navigation, and direct linking back to source org files. Primary users are Emacs power users, software developers, and technical project managers who prefer staying within the Emacs ecosystem for comprehensive project planning and tracking workflows.
