Docs is a self-hosted collaborative documentation and knowledge management platform built with Django REST Framework backend and Next.js/React frontend, targeting organizations seeking open-source alternatives to Notion, Confluence, or Google Docs. The platform implements real-time collaborative editing using BlockNote.js, Yjs, and HocusPocus for operational transformation, enabling simultaneous multi-user document editing with live synchronization. It features granular access control, offline editing capabilities, markdown support, AI-powered text operations, and multi-format export (PDF, DOCX, ODT). Designed for government agencies, enterprises, and teams requiring secure, scalable documentation systems, it addresses knowledge sharing and collaborative writing workflows while maintaining data sovereignty through self-hosting capabilities via Docker, Helm charts, or Nix packages.
