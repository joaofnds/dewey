CozoDB is a multi-paradigm database system written in Rust that combines transactional, relational, graph, and vector database capabilities using Datalog as its primary query language. Targeting AI/ML developers and data scientists, it supports embedded deployment, client-server architectures, and cross-platform execution including WASM for browser environments. The database integrates HNSW vector indexing for similarity search, graph algorithms for network analysis, and full-text search within a unified Datalog interface, enabling complex analytical workflows that span traditional relational queries, graph traversals, and vector operations. Available through bindings for Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Swift, and other languages, it addresses use cases requiring multi-modal data processing, knowledge graphs, and AI-powered applications where different data paradigms need seamless integration within transactional boundaries.
