Ice is a macOS menu bar management utility built in Swift using SwiftUI that provides comprehensive control over menu bar item visibility and organization. Targeting macOS power users and productivity enthusiasts, it addresses menu bar clutter by implementing hide/show functionality, drag-and-drop item arrangement, and customizable spacing controls. The application leverages macOS 14+ system APIs to offer advanced features including an alternative "Ice Bar" for hidden items (particularly useful for MacBook notch displays), menu bar appearance customization with tints and borders, hotkey integration, and search functionality for menu bar items. It serves users who need to manage numerous menu bar applications while maintaining a clean desktop interface, particularly beneficial for developers and professionals running multiple system utilities simultaneously.
