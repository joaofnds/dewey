`polly-jest-presets` is a TypeScript library providing an opinionated configuration and wrapper around Polly.js and setup-polly-jest, streamlining network request recording and playback within Jest tests for Node.js web applications. It bundles necessary Polly packages and uses the File persister, simplifying setup and automatically recording HTTP interactions during test execution, enabling offline testing and predictable behavior. This developer productivity tool targets developers writing tests, enabling automated testing of network requests in a controlled environment, with explicit recording and configurable expiry for recordings.
