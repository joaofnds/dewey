This TypeScript package provides an opinionated Jest testing preset that integrates Polly.js for automatic HTTP request recording and playback during test execution. Targeting Node.js web application developers, it bundles Polly's core libraries, Node HTTP adapter, and file system persister to enable seamless network request mocking without manual setup. The preset addresses the common testing challenge of handling external API dependencies by recording real HTTP interactions during initial test runs (record mode) and replaying them in subsequent executions (replay mode), ensuring consistent and fast test execution. It uses filesystem-based .har file storage for request recordings and includes opinionated defaults like 14-day recording expiration and explicit recording-only mode to prevent unexpected test artifacts, making it particularly suitable for JavaScript/TypeScript developers building web applications that consume external APIs.
