p-map is a JavaScript utility library for Node.js and web development that provides controlled concurrent execution of promise-returning functions across iterables. It addresses the limitation of Promise.all() by offering configurable concurrency controls, error handling strategies, and backpressure management for async operations. The library targets JavaScript developers working with HTTP requests, API calls, file processing, or any scenario requiring parallel async task execution with resource constraints. Key features include concurrency limiting, streaming results via async iterables, abort signal support, selective error propagation, and skip functionality for filtering results. It's particularly valuable for developers building scalable applications that need to balance performance through parallelism while avoiding resource exhaustion from unlimited concurrent operations.
