`p-map` is a JavaScript library designed for concurrent execution of asynchronous operations over an iterable, focusing on Node.js environments. Its core functionality enables parallel processing of promises, providing features like concurrency control and streamlined iteration over asynchronous functions using `async/await`. This library targets JavaScript developers seeking to improve performance and manage asynchronous workflows by mapping operations concurrently across a set of promises. It allows for applying a mapper function to an array or iterable, while concurrently running the promises, facilitating efficient, parallel data processing and control over the concurrency limit, making it a developer productivity tool.
