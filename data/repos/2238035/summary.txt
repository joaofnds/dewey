vim-commentary is a minimalist Vim plugin that provides intelligent code commenting functionality through Vim's operator mapping system. Written in Vim Script at under 100 lines of code, it enables developers to toggle comments on lines, text objects, and visual selections using intuitive keybindings like `gcc` for line commenting and `gc` with motion commands for precise comment targeting. The plugin leverages Vim's `commentstring` setting to support multiple programming languages and file types, automatically detecting appropriate comment syntax for each context. Targeting software developers across all programming domains who use Vim as their primary editor, it solves the common need for efficient code commenting/uncommenting during development workflows. The plugin integrates seamlessly with Vim's native operator-pending mode and supports both interactive usage and Ex command-line operations for batch commenting tasks.
