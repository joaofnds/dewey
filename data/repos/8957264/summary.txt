The `TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks` repository hosts the source code for a web application framework performance benchmarking suite. It measures the performance of various web application frameworks across multiple programming languages, including Go, Python, Java, and C++. The project provides tests for features like plaintext responses, JSON serialization, database interactions (ORM), and server-side templating. This suite is a standalone tool for developers to evaluate and compare the performance characteristics of different web application frameworks, aiding in technology selection and optimization. The project is built with C++ and utilizes Docker and Vagrant for a consistent testing environment.
