TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks (TFB) is a comprehensive web application framework performance testing suite that measures and compares the execution speed of web frameworks across multiple programming languages including Go, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, C#, JavaScript, and others. The project implements standardized benchmark tests covering JSON serialization, database operations via ORMs, server-side templating, and XSS protection to provide objective performance metrics for web developers and framework maintainers. Built using Docker containerization with support for Vagrant deployment, TFB targets web developers, framework authors, and DevOps engineers who need empirical data to make informed decisions about web technology stack selection. The benchmarking suite addresses the critical problem of objectively comparing web framework performance across different languages and architectures in standardized testing environments.
