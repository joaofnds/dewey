`nvim-nio` is a Lua library designed to provide asynchronous input/output (IO) capabilities within the Neovim text editor environment. It offers a suite of asynchronous primitives and APIs for core Neovim functions, including file operations, subprocess execution, UI interactions, and integration with Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients. Key functionalities include `nio.control` for flow control, `nio.lsp` for an async LSP client, and async versions of `vim.loop` and `vim.ui` functions. This library is a plugin/extension for Neovim, empowering developers to write asynchronous code within the editor using Lua coroutines.
