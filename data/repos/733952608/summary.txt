nvim-nio is an asynchronous I/O library for Neovim plugin development, targeting the text editor ecosystem and Lua-based plugin architecture. Built on Lua coroutines, it provides async primitives and APIs for common Neovim operations including LSP client communication, file system operations, subprocess management, and UI interactions. The library wraps vim.loop (libuv) functions with async interfaces and offers flow control primitives like events and futures. It solves the complexity of asynchronous programming in Neovim plugins by providing a Python asyncio-inspired API that works seamlessly with standard Lua error handling. Primary users are Neovim plugin developers building testing frameworks, debugging tools, REST clients, and other plugins requiring non-blocking operations for file I/O, network requests, or subprocess execution.
