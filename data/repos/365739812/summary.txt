tldraw is a React-based TypeScript SDK for building infinite canvas applications, primarily targeting web developers creating collaborative whiteboard and diagramming experiences. The library provides a comprehensive toolkit for implementing pan-and-zoom canvases with drawing, sketching, and shape manipulation capabilities. Built on React with TypeScript, it supports real-time multiplayer collaboration and synchronization features, making it suitable for developers building design tools, digital whiteboards, mind mapping applications, and collaborative visual workspace platforms. The SDK abstracts complex canvas rendering, gesture handling, and state management while offering extensive customization options. It addresses the technical challenges of creating performant infinite canvas experiences without requiring developers to implement low-level canvas operations, coordinate transformations, or collaboration infrastructure from scratch.
