PEG.js is a JavaScript-based parser generator that implements Parsing Expression Grammar (PEG) algorithms to automatically generate fast, production-ready parsers from declarative grammar specifications. Targeting JavaScript developers and language implementers, it solves the complex problem of building robust parsers for domain-specific languages, configuration files, data formats, and programming language frontends without manually writing recursive descent parsing logic. The tool generates JavaScript parser code with excellent error reporting capabilities, enabling developers to create compilers, interpreters, data transformers, and language processing tools. Its monorepo structure includes benchmarking, bundling, and testing utilities, making it particularly valuable for web development, compiler construction, and any application requiring structured text parsing in JavaScript environments.
