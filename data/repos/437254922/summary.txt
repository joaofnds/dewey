`weird` is a Common Lisp library and generative art system for creating vector graphics and plotter art. It provides a graph data structure (`weir`) with an "alterations" system enabling deferred state modifications, useful for creating complex generative processes. Key components include 2D/3D vector mathematics via `cl-veq`, random number generation, and an SVG drawing tool (`wsvg`). This project is a library designed for artists and programmers interested in procedural art generation and is intended for personal use, with limited emphasis on external collaboration.
