`weird` is a Common Lisp generative art system designed for creating computational art through algorithmic processes. The library provides a comprehensive toolkit for digital artists and creative coders, featuring a graph data structure (`weir`) for modeling complex relationships, 2D/3D vector mathematics via `cl-veq`, SVG rendering capabilities (`wsvg`), and specialized random number generation functions. Its core innovation is an "alterations" system that enables deferred graph modifications with dependency resolution, allowing artists to define complex transformations that execute atomically. The system targets plotter art, vector graphics generation, and procedural art creation, supporting workflows from algorithm development to final SVG output. Designed for generative artists working with mathematical art, graph-based simulations, and vector plotting systems.
