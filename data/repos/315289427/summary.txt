ArtLine is a Jupyter Notebook-based project focused on generating line art portraits from input images using deep learning techniques. It leverages a pre-trained UNET generator with self-attention and perceptual loss based on VGG16 for creating detailed facial features and image style adjustments, integrated with ControlNet for style control via text instructions. The project implements progressive resizing and utilizes datasets like APDrawingDB and anime sketch colorization pairs for model training, enabling users to convert portrait photos into line art representations. It is an example/template project and primarily targets AI/machine learning enthusiasts and artists interested in generative art.
