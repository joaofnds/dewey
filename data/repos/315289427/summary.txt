ArtLine is a deep learning project that converts portrait photographs into line art drawings using computer vision and generative models. Built primarily in Jupyter Notebooks for the AI/ML domain, it employs a UNET generator architecture with spectral normalization, self-attention mechanisms, and progressive resizing techniques, trained on combined APDrawing and anime sketch datasets. The system uses perceptual loss based on VGG16 features without requiring GANs, and integrates with ControlNet for instruction-guided style manipulation. Designed for AI researchers, computer vision engineers, and creative technologists, it addresses automatic artistic stylization of human portraits, offering both smooth and high-quality model variants deployable through Google Colab notebooks for accessible experimentation and application in generative art workflows.
