This repository implements a Chrome browser extension that provides advanced HTML5 video playback speed controls for web video consumption. Built in JavaScript, it targets web users and content consumers who need granular control over video playback rates across any website with HTML5 video elements. The extension solves the limitation of native video players that either hide or restrict speed adjustment functionality by overlaying a customizable speed controller with keyboard shortcuts (S/D for speed adjustment, Z/X for seeking, R for reset). It addresses the ergonomic mismatch between average reading speed (250-300 WPM) and typical video speech rates (~150 WPM) by enabling users to easily accelerate playback to 1.3-2x+ speeds, improving engagement and retention for educational content, presentations, and general video consumption across platforms like YouTube.
