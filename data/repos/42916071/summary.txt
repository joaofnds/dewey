Parinfer.js is a JavaScript library designed to simplify Lisp programming by automatically adjusting parenthesis and indentation. It provides two core modes: Indent Mode, which corrects indentation based on parenthesis placement, and Paren Mode, which corrects parenthesis based on indentation changes. Functionality is exposed through `smartMode`, `indentMode`, and `parenMode` functions, returning formatted text and cursor position, with options for comment characters, paren characters, and error handling. Primarily a developer productivity tool, Parinfer.js is a JavaScript library published on npm and is intended for integration within text editors and IDEs to improve the Lisp coding experience.
