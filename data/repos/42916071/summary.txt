Parinfer.js is a JavaScript library that provides automatic parentheses balancing and indentation correction for Lisp programming languages through pure text transformation functions. Targeting Lisp developers and code editor integrations, it implements three core modes: Indent Mode (auto-adjusts parens based on indentation), Paren Mode (auto-adjusts indentation based on parentheses), and Smart Mode (hybrid approach). The library processes source code text and returns corrected output with metadata including cursor position adjustments, error handling for malformed syntax, tab stops for editor integration, and paren trail identification. Designed as a foundational tool for Lisp code editors and REPLs, it addresses the complexity of manual parentheses management in Lisp syntax, making the language more accessible while maintaining compatibility with advanced editing tools like Paredit.
