`mind.nvim` is a Lua plugin for Neovim, designed as a note-taking and task management tool that facilitates tree-based organization. It enables users to create and manipulate hierarchical trees for tasks, journaling, personal wikis, and other workflows, providing features for node creation, editing (renaming, changing icons), deletion, and movement. The plugin leverages Neovim's UI elements, including `vim.ui.input` and `vim.ui.select`, for user interaction, and supports keybindings and node-associated data files or URLs. As a Neovim plugin, its target audience is users of the Neovim text editor who seek enhanced organizational capabilities within their editing workflow.
