mind.nvim is a deprecated Neovim plugin written in Lua that provided hierarchical tree-based organization for note-taking, task management, and personal knowledge management within the editor. Targeting developers and power users who prefer terminal-based workflows, it implemented a tree data structure for organizing information beyond traditional flat TODO lists, supporting both global and local project trees stored as files. The plugin leveraged Neovim 0.7.2+ features including vim.ui.input and vim.ui.select for interactive node manipulation, cursor-based navigation, and supported multiple node types including text, data files (Markdown), and URL nodes. It addressed the problem of disorganized documentation and task tracking by providing structured hierarchical organization directly within the development environment, competing with tools like org-mode and Notion but integrated into Neovim's ecosystem.
