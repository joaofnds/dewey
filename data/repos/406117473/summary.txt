Clear Sans is an open-source OpenType font designed for optimal on-screen legibility across various media, including print and web. It provides a versatile typeface family including multiple weights and styles, supporting Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek scripts. This library-style project is primarily targeted at application, browser, and operating system developers seeking a freely distributable font with a balance of modern aesthetics and functional clarity, particularly for UI design. The repository is no longer maintained by Intel, and users are directed to fork the project for continued use or development.
