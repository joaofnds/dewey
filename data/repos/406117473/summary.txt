Clear Sans is a discontinued OpenType font family specifically designed for on-screen legibility and user interface applications. Targeting UI/UX designers, web developers, and application developers, it addresses the technical challenge of cross-platform text rendering and readability in digital interfaces. The font supports Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek character sets with multiple weights (thin, light, regular, medium, bold) and styles (upright, italic), optimized for both short UI labels and extended reading. Originally developed by Monotype under Intel's direction, it was distributed under Apache 2.0 license for integration into browsers, operating systems, and web applications where consistent typography and screen legibility are critical technical requirements.
