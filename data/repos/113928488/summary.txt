Windows10Debloater is a PowerShell-based system administration utility designed for Windows 10 optimization and privacy hardening. The repository provides three variants: an interactive CLI script, a GUI application, and a silent deployment version with switch parameters (-SysPrep, -Debloat, -Privacy). It automates removal of pre-installed AppX packages, disables telemetry functions, stops Cortana search indexing, removes unnecessary scheduled tasks, and applies system-level privacy configurations. The tool targets system administrators, IT professionals, and power users managing Windows 10 deployments, particularly useful for MDT (Microsoft Deployment Toolkit) image preparation and enterprise system configuration. The silent version supports automated deployment scenarios while the GUI version accommodates less technical users requiring bloatware removal and privacy optimization.
