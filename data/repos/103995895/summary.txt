GoCV is a Go language binding library for OpenCV 4 that enables computer vision and image processing applications in Go. Targeting computer vision developers and researchers, it provides comprehensive access to OpenCV's core functionality including deep neural networks (DNN), CUDA GPU acceleration, Intel OpenVINO inference, and OpenCV Contrib modules. The library supports real-time video capture, image manipulation, object detection, face recognition, and machine learning model deployment using frameworks like TensorFlow, ONNX, and YOLO. Key features include MJPEG streaming, object tracking, classification algorithms, and cross-platform compatibility across Linux, macOS, and Windows. GoCV bridges the gap between Go's concurrent programming capabilities and OpenCV's mature computer vision ecosystem, enabling developers to build performant vision applications, video analytics systems, and AI-powered image processing pipelines using Go's syntax and toolchain.
