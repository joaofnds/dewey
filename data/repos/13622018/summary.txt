org-download is an Emacs Lisp extension that streamlines image integration workflows for Emacs org-mode users in documentation and note-taking domains. It enables drag-and-drop functionality for images from web browsers and file systems directly into org-mode buffers, automatically handling file storage, directory organization, and inline link generation. The tool supports multiple image acquisition methods including clipboard pasting, screenshot capture via system tools (gnome-screenshot, scrot, screencapture), and URL-based downloads using configurable backends (url-retrieve, wget, curl). Key features include customizable storage strategies through org-mode attachment machinery or directory-based organization with heading-level folder structures, timestamp integration, and buffer-local configuration options. This addresses the common workflow friction faced by technical writers, researchers, and developers who frequently embed images in org-mode documents for documentation, research notes, and technical specifications.
