`org-download` is an Emacs Lisp extension designed to facilitate the insertion of images into Emacs org-mode files. Its primary functionality includes enabling image drag-and-drop from various sources, such as web browsers, file systems, and the clipboard, into org-mode buffers, generating inline image links. The extension also supports image insertion via screenshot commands and the `org-download-yank` command, which retrieves images from the kill-ring. Users can customize image storage locations and filenames with `org-download-method` and `org-download-timestamp` configuration options. This plugin targets Emacs users and developers seeking enhanced image handling within their org-mode workflows.
