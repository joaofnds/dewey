m4b-tool is a PHP-based command-line utility that serves as a wrapper around FFmpeg and mp4v2 for processing audiobook files in the digital media/audio processing domain. It enables audiobook enthusiasts and content creators to merge multiple audio files (MP3, AAC, OGG, FLAC, M4A) into single M4B audiobook files, split existing audiobooks by chapters, and manipulate chapter metadata through silence detection or MusicBrainz integration. The tool addresses the specific need for audiobook file management and format conversion, supporting comprehensive metadata handling including cover art, descriptions, and chapter information. Target users include audiobook collectors, content creators, and digital media archivists who need to standardize and organize audio content into the M4B audiobook format while preserving audio quality and structural metadata.
