`m4b-tool` is a PHP command-line utility designed to merge, split, and chapterize audiobook files, specifically targeting the .m4b format but supporting various audio codecs like MP3, AAC, and FLAC. Its primary functionalities include merging multiple audio files into a single .m4b audiobook, splitting existing .m4b files into chapters or individual tracks, and adding/adjusting chapter metadata, including integration with MusicBrainz for chapter lookup. The tool leverages `ffmpeg` and `mp4v2` for audio processing, with optional use of `fdkaac` for enhanced AAC encoding at lower bitrates. This standalone application is aimed at users who want to manage and manipulate their audiobook collections.
