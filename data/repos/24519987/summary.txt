Squid is a high-performance web proxy cache server implemented in C++ that provides HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP proxying capabilities for network infrastructure and enterprise environments. It targets system administrators, network engineers, and DevOps professionals who need to optimize web traffic, reduce bandwidth usage, and implement access control policies. The software supports advanced protocols including ICAP (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) and eCAP (eContent Adaptation Protocol) for content filtering and modification. Squid serves as an intermediary between clients and web servers, caching frequently requested content to improve response times and reduce upstream bandwidth consumption. It addresses enterprise networking challenges including content filtering, access logging, traffic shaping, and security policy enforcement in corporate networks, ISPs, and educational institutions.
