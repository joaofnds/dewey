`Squid` is a standalone, high-performance web proxy cache written in C++. It functions as a caching server for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and other web protocols, optimizing network performance by storing frequently accessed web content. Supporting ICAP and eCAP, Squid provides the capability to integrate with content filtering and modification systems. The project is a core infrastructure component typically deployed by system administrators and network engineers to enhance web server performance and control web traffic.
