TheoremJS is a comprehensive JavaScript mathematical computation library designed for web developers and JavaScript engineers requiring advanced mathematical functionality in browser and Node.js environments. The framework provides extensive mathematical operations spanning algebra, number theory, statistics, and other mathematical domains, serving as a foundational toolkit for computational applications, data visualization projects, and mathematical modeling tasks. Built purely in JavaScript with npm distribution support, it targets front-end developers building educational platforms, financial applications, scientific computing tools, and data analysis dashboards who need robust mathematical capabilities without requiring external mathematical engines or complex dependencies. The library abstracts complex mathematical computations into accessible JavaScript APIs, enabling developers to integrate sophisticated mathematical operations directly into web applications and JavaScript-based computational workflows.
