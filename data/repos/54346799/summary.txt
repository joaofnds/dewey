The public-apis repository serves as a community-curated catalog of free public APIs organized by domain categories for software developers and engineers. Built primarily for web development, mobile app development, and data integration use cases, this Python-based project maintains a structured dataset of API endpoints spanning domains like authentication, finance, weather, geolocation, and entertainment. The repository functions as a developer resource hub, providing API discovery and integration references for building applications that require external data sources or services. Target users include full-stack developers, frontend engineers, mobile developers, and data engineers seeking accessible APIs for prototyping, development, and production applications without requiring paid subscriptions or complex authentication workflows.
