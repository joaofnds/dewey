Kepler.gl is an open-source geospatial data visualization platform built in TypeScript for analyzing and visualizing large-scale location datasets in web applications. Built on MapLibre GL and deck.gl, it renders millions of geospatial data points with real-time spatial aggregations and provides interactive mapping capabilities. The framework targets data scientists, GIS analysts, and web developers working with location-based datasets, offering both a standalone React application and embeddable React-Redux components. It leverages Redux for state management, react-palm middleware for side effects, and requires Mapbox tokens for map rendering. The platform addresses the need for high-performance browser-based geospatial analysis tools that can handle enterprise-scale datasets without requiring desktop GIS software, enabling rapid exploration and visualization of transportation, logistics, and location intelligence data.
