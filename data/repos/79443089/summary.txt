Evil is an Emacs Lisp package that implements a comprehensive Vi/Vim emulation layer within the Emacs text editor, targeting software developers and technical writers who prefer Vim's modal editing paradigm but want access to Emacs' extensibility ecosystem. The package recreates Vim's core functionality including modal states (normal, insert, visual, operator-pending), keybindings, text objects, motions, and editing commands while maintaining compatibility with Emacs' underlying architecture and package system. It integrates with essential Emacs packages like undo-tree/undo-fu for redo functionality and goto-chg for change navigation, solving the workflow friction experienced by Vim users who need Emacs' advanced features for programming, configuration management, or document editing but don't want to abandon familiar Vi-style modal editing mechanics.
