The `techdocs-cli` repository, formerly a standalone project, housed the command-line interface (CLI) utilities for managing TechDocs sites within the Backstage platform. Written in TypeScript, it provided tools for interacting with and maintaining documentation generated by the TechDocs component of Backstage. This project type is a developer productivity tool, specifically a CLI, related to Backstage, a platform for building developer portals. The project is now integrated into the main `backstage/backstage` monorepo.
