`LaMa` is a research artifact and a PyTorch-based project focused on image inpainting, specifically addressing resolution-robust large mask inpainting with Fourier Convolutions. It implements a generative adversarial network (GAN) for high-resolution image completion, enabling the filling of large masked regions within images. Key functionalities include the ability to handle high-resolution images exceeding the training resolution, offering inference via command-line interface (CLI) and Colab notebooks for ease of use, and supporting diverse training data, including Places and CelebA datasets. The project utilizes Fourier transforms and convolutions and includes detailed documentation and examples implemented in Jupyter Notebooks.
