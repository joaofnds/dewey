LaMa is a deep learning-based image inpainting system that uses Fourier convolutions to fill in missing or masked regions in images. Built with PyTorch and GANs, it addresses the computer vision problem of reconstructing corrupted image areas while maintaining visual coherence and texture consistency. The model demonstrates remarkable resolution robustness, generalizing from 256x256 training images to ~2K resolution inference, making it particularly effective for large mask completion and periodic structure reconstruction. Targeting computer vision researchers, ML engineers, and application developers, LaMa serves as both a research baseline for inpainting algorithms and a practical tool for content-aware image editing applications. The repository includes training code, pre-trained models, and integration examples for deployment in various image processing workflows.
