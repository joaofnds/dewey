Touch Bar Simulator is a standalone macOS application written in Swift that provides access to Apple's Touch Bar interface on any Mac without requiring Xcode installation. Targeting macOS developers and power users, it addresses the limitation of Apple's Touch Bar simulator being bundled within Xcode by exposing private Touch Bar APIs as an independent utility. The application features a menu bar interface, window docking capabilities, transparency controls, screenshot functionality, and keyboard shortcut support. It leverages private macOS frameworks and APIs that communicate directly with the Touch Bar simulator, making it unavailable through the App Store due to Apple's restrictions on private API usage in developer tooling applications.
