s.el is a comprehensive string manipulation library for Emacs Lisp that addresses the historically limited string processing capabilities in the Emacs ecosystem. Designed for Emacs developers and power users, it provides over 50 functions organized into categories including whitespace handling (trim, pad, collapse), string truncation/extension operations, list conversion utilities, predicate functions for string validation, case transformation, and word processing with support for various naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case). The library solves the fundamental problem of Emacs Lisp's sparse built-in string API by offering a cohesive, well-tested interface for common text processing tasks essential in configuration management, text editing automation, and Emacs package development, making it a foundational utility for the Emacs development community.
