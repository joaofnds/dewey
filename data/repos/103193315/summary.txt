`AASM-Diagram` is a Ruby library designed to generate visual diagrams of state machines defined using the AASM gem. It leverages Graphviz to render state machine diagrams from Ruby code, enabling users to visualize state transitions and structures. The library integrates with Rails projects via Railties and provides a Rake task for generating diagrams from model definitions, supporting both single and multiple state machines within a class. This developer productivity tool specifically targets Ruby developers using AASM for state management in their applications.
