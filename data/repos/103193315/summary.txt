AASM Diagram is a Ruby gem that generates visual diagrams for AASM (Acts As State Machine) state machines using Graphviz. Targeted at Ruby and Rails developers, it automatically converts state machine definitions into PNG diagrams showing states, transitions, events, and guards. The tool integrates with Rails via Railties and provides Rake tasks for automated diagram generation, supporting multiple state machines per class and customizable output directories. It addresses the documentation and visualization needs of developers working with complex state-driven application logic, making state machine behavior easier to understand and communicate through automatically generated visual representations of state transitions and business logic flows.
