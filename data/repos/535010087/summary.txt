Arnis is a Rust-based geospatial data processing tool that generates detailed Minecraft Java Edition worlds from real-world geographic data. Built with Tauri for cross-platform GUI support, it leverages OpenStreetMap data through the Overpass API to create accurate 3D representations of cities, landmarks, and terrain features in Minecraft's block-based format. The application processes OSM nodes, ways, and relations through a multi-stage pipeline that handles coordinate transformation, element prioritization, and chunk-based world generation. Targeting Minecraft enthusiasts, educators, and modders in the gaming/simulation domain, Arnis solves the complex problem of translating geospatial vector data into voxel-based game worlds, replacing manual building processes with automated geographic reconstruction while maintaining architectural accuracy and proper block placement hierarchy.
