Arnis is a Rust-based application that leverages OpenStreetMap data to generate highly detailed Minecraft Java Edition worlds reflecting real-world geography and architecture. The core functionality of this project involves fetching geospatial data from the Overpass API, parsing raw data, sorting elements by priority, and generating a Minecraft world using a series of element processors. This tool is designed to handle large-scale data and generate rich, immersive environments that bring real-world cities, landmarks, and natural features into Minecraft. The technology stack includes Rust, Tauri, and the Overpass API for data retrieval. Arnis is an application aimed at Minecraft enthusiasts who wish to replicate real-world locations within their game.
