`src-d/engine-deprecated` is a discontinued command-line tool and application that provided language-agnostic code analysis and Git history analysis for developers. Written in Go, it leveraged Universal Abstract Syntax Trees (UASTs) generated by a component called Babelfish to parse source code, identify languages, and extract key information. The tool facilitated SQL-based querying of Git repositories and offered integration with a web-based SQL interface, supporting features for code processing, git history analysis, and querying with familiar APIs. Designed as a developer productivity tool, it provided functionalities to analyze code and its evolution by creating an index to the existing local and remote Git repositories.
