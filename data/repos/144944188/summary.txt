source{d} Engine is a discontinued Go-based code analysis platform designed for software engineering analytics and mining software repositories. It provided language-agnostic source code analysis by leveraging Universal Abstract Syntax Trees (UASTs) through Babelfish parsers, enabling developers and engineering teams to perform complex queries across codebases written in multiple programming languages. The engine combined static code analysis with Git history analysis using SQL queries, allowing users to extract insights from both source code structure and version control metadata. Built on Docker containerization, it exposed APIs through gRPC and SQL interfaces for integrating code analysis into data science workflows, engineering productivity tools, and developer experience platforms. The project targeted engineering managers, developer tooling teams, and data scientists working on software engineering metrics and code quality analysis.
