rspec-rails is a Ruby gem that integrates the RSpec testing framework with Ruby on Rails applications as a drop-in replacement for Rails' default Minitest framework. Targeting web developers building Rails applications, it provides Rails-specific testing utilities, generators, and matchers that understand Rails conventions for models, controllers, views, and other Rails components. The gem follows Rails version compatibility, supporting Rails 7+ in current versions, and offers seamless integration with Rails' generator system to automatically create spec files when generating Rails components. It solves the problem of Rails developers who prefer RSpec's behavior-driven development (BDD) approach and descriptive testing syntax over Minitest, while maintaining full compatibility with Rails' architecture and conventions for comprehensive web application testing.
