`rspec-rails` is a Ruby gem providing an alternative testing framework for Ruby on Rails applications, integrating the RSpec testing DSL. It enables developers to write application behavior specifications in plain English, generating reports that detail how the application conforms to the specifications. Key functionalities include generating boilerplate spec files, running various spec types (model, controller, request, feature, etc.), and providing Rails-specific matchers. The project is a library/plugin, supporting Rails versions 7+ and offering compatibility across multiple versions, thus streamlining the testing process for Rails developers.
