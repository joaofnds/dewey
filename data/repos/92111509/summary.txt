Trilium Notes is a hierarchical personal knowledge management application built with JavaScript and Electron, designed for individuals seeking to organize and interconnect large collections of notes and information. The system operates as either a desktop application or self-hosted web server, featuring a tree-based note organization with cloning capabilities, WYSIWYG editing with CKEditor 5, source code syntax highlighting via CodeMirror, and visual relationship mapping through jsPlumb. Core technical features include client-server synchronization, per-note encryption, REST API integration, scripting capabilities, and mobile-optimized interfaces. Target users include knowledge workers, researchers, developers, and personal productivity enthusiasts who require sophisticated note-taking beyond simple text editors, with scalability supporting 100,000+ notes while maintaining local-first data control and optional self-hosted synchronization.
