Tidy Viewer (tv) is a cross-platform command-line CSV pretty printer written in Rust, designed for data science and terminal-based data analysis workflows. It addresses the problem of viewing large CSV files and tabular data in terminal environments by implementing intelligent column styling, significant figure formatting, and overflow handling. The tool features automatic NA value detection and highlighting, decimal dust reduction through configurable significant digit display, Unicode truncation, and color-coded output optimized for terminal readability. Target users include data scientists, analysts, and developers working with CSV files who need quick, formatted data visualization without opening external applications. It integrates with common CLI data manipulation tools like xsv, qsv, miller, and DuckDB, serving as a visualization layer for command-line data processing pipelines.
