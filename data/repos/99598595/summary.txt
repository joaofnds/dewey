Parcel is a zero-configuration module bundler and build tool for web development that automates the compilation, optimization, and packaging of web applications. It targets frontend developers working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and various web assets, providing automatic transpilation, minification, tree-shaking, code splitting, and hot module replacement without requiring manual configuration. The tool features a Rust-based JavaScript compiler for performance, supports CommonJS and ES6 modules, handles multiple output targets for different browser environments, and includes a development server with hot reloading. Parcel addresses the complexity of modern web build pipelines by eliminating the need for manual webpack, Babel, or PostCSS configuration while maintaining extensibility through a plugin system for larger applications.
