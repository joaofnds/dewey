vim-test is a Vim/Neovim plugin that provides a unified interface for executing tests across multiple programming languages and testing frameworks directly from the editor. It supports over 50 test runners including Jest, pytest, RSpec, Go test, Maven, Gradle, and many others, automatically detecting the appropriate runner based on project structure. The plugin offers granular test execution (single test, test file, or entire suite) with configurable execution strategies including terminal integration, tmux, and background processes. Built entirely in Vim Script with zero external dependencies, it solves the workflow friction of context-switching between editor and terminal for TDD practitioners and software developers who prefer vim-based development environments across web development, backend services, and general software engineering projects.
