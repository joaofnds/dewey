This repository provides a chapter-by-chapter implementation of the AuctionSniper application from the book "Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided By Tests," serving as a practical educational resource. Built in Java using Maven for dependency management, it utilizes Mockito for mocking and OpenFire v3.8 with Smack for communication, differing from the original book's example in these technology choices. This project type is an example/study of the book implementation and targets developers learning and studying GOOS concepts with practical code.
