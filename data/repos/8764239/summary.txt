This repository implements a chapter-by-chapter build of the AuctionSniper application from the book "Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided By Tests," serving as a practical demonstration of test-driven development (TDD) and object-oriented design principles. Built with Java and Maven, it uses Mockito for mocking instead of the original JMock framework, and integrates with OpenFire v3.8 XMPP server via the Smack client library to simulate auction bidding functionality. The project targets software developers learning TDD methodologies, providing a hands-on example of building maintainable Java applications through iterative development guided by automated testing. Each Git tag corresponds to a book chapter, allowing developers to follow the evolutionary design process and understand how test-first development shapes software architecture in enterprise Java applications.
