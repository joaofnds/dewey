`cmd` is a Common Lisp utility library designed for executing external programs, providing features to manage arguments safely and efficiently. It offers functionalities like argument handling, including tokenization, keyword argument support for UIOP options, and process substitution using `psub`.  Key features include redirection capabilities using both strings and keywords, control over the working directory and environment, and several entry points like `cmd`, `$cmd`, `cmd!`, `cmd?`, and `cmd&`.  The library leverages `uiop:launch-program` for process creation and incorporates error handling, environment variable management, and path control via `*cmd-env*` and `*cmd-path*`, offering hooks for customization. This is a library intended for Common Lisp developers who need to interface with external programs from within their Lisp code.
