The `cmd` repository is a Common Lisp utility library for executing external programs and shell commands, built on top of UIOP's `launch-program` functionality. It targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and Lisp developers who need to integrate external command execution into multi-threaded Common Lisp applications. The library provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for constructing shell commands while preventing shell injection vulnerabilities through tokenization via cl-shlex rather than shell interpretation. Key features include cross-platform support (Unix/Windows), process substitution capabilities, environment variable control, working directory management thread-safe for concurrent execution, and multiple execution modes including synchronous execution with exit codes, output capture, and conditional execution. It serves as a safer, more ergonomic alternative to direct UIOP usage for system automation and process orchestration tasks.
