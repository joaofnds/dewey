quickrun.el is an Emacs extension that provides rapid code execution capabilities for developers working across multiple programming languages within the Emacs editor environment. Built as an Emacs Lisp port of vim-quickrun, it enables immediate execution of code buffers, regions, or files without leaving the editor, supporting over 40 languages including compiled languages (C/C++, Go, Java, Rust), interpreted languages (Python, Ruby, Perl, JavaScript), functional languages (Haskell, Clojure, Erlang), and markup languages (Markdown, HAML). The package handles compilation and execution workflows automatically, manages temporary files, provides customizable command parameters and timeouts, and integrates with Emacs' compilation framework. Target users are software developers and programmers who need quick feedback loops for testing code snippets, prototyping, or educational purposes across polyglot development environments, eliminating the context-switching overhead of external terminals or IDEs for simple code execution tasks.
