Sitefox is a ClojureScript web framework designed for building backend web applications, primarily targeting indie developers prioritizing rapid development. It provides a batteries-included approach with features such as routing, templating (Reagent integration), database access (Keyv-backed), session management, authentication, email capabilities, form handling, and live reloading. The framework leverages Node.js and includes support for nbb and shadow-cljs build tools, incorporating key libraries like express (web server), node-html-parser, and nodemailer. This library/framework aims to streamline full-stack ClojureScript development.
