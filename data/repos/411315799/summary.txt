Sitefox is a full-stack web framework for building Node.js applications using ClojureScript, targeting indie developers who need rapid web application development. Built on Express.js, it provides a batteries-included approach similar to Flask and Sinatra, offering integrated routing, server-side Reagent templating, SQLite/PostgreSQL database connectivity with key-value store abstraction, session management, authentication, email capabilities, and form handling. The framework supports both nbb and shadow-cljs build systems, enabling developers to write both backend and frontend code in ClojureScript while leveraging the Node.js ecosystem. It solves the complexity of setting up modern web application infrastructure by providing opinionated defaults and seamless integration between database operations, HTML templating, and web server functionality, allowing ClojureScript developers to ship production-ready web applications quickly without extensive configuration.
