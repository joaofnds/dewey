Bootstrap is a comprehensive front-end CSS framework designed for web developers building responsive, mobile-first websites and web applications. Built with Sass/SCSS and JavaScript, it provides a standardized grid system, pre-styled UI components, utility classes, and interactive elements that accelerate HTML/CSS development workflows. The framework addresses cross-browser compatibility issues and responsive design challenges by offering a consistent foundation of reusable components including navigation bars, forms, buttons, modals, and layout systems. Distributed via multiple package managers (npm, yarn, Composer, NuGet), Bootstrap targets front-end developers, full-stack engineers, and web designers who need to rapidly prototype and deploy professional-looking web interfaces without building CSS frameworks from scratch, significantly reducing development time and ensuring design consistency across projects.
