This repository implements a COVID-19 data visualization dashboard built with Clojure and the Oz library for data science applications. The dashboard targets data scientists and Clojure developers working in epidemiological data analysis, consuming UK Government coronavirus datasets to generate interactive web-based visualizations including line plots, bar charts, and geospatial maps. Built on the Clojure ecosystem using Clojure CLI tools, the application processes CSV data from the UK's official coronavirus API (coronavirus.data.gov.uk) and renders browser-based dashboards through Oz's Vega-Lite integration. The solution addresses the need for real-time epidemiological data visualization and serves as a practical example of functional programming approaches to data science workflows, demonstrating how to transform government health datasets into actionable visual insights for public health monitoring and analysis.
