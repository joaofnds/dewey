The `covid19-dashboard` project is a standalone Clojure application designed for data visualization within the domain of public health, specifically focused on presenting UK COVID-19 statistics. It leverages the Oz Clojure library for creating interactive dashboards, displaying data from the UK government's coronavirus data API through a web interface. Functionality includes visualization of case and death data, deployable as an uberjar. The project serves as a practical example of data science visualization techniques using Clojure and the Oz library and targets users interested in data analysis and Clojure programming, offering a demonstration of data retrieval, processing, and dashboard presentation techniques.
