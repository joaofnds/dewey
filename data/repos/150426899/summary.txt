Biscuit is a research operating system kernel implemented in Go for x86-64 architectures, developed by MIT PDOS to study performance trade-offs of using garbage-collected high-level languages for kernel development. This monolithic kernel provides a POSIX subset interface with multicore support, kernel threads, journaled filesystem with concurrent operations, virtual memory management, TCP/IP networking stack, AHCI SATA drivers, and Intel 10Gb NIC drivers. Built as a fork of Go 1.10.1 runtime with custom modifications, Biscuit includes its own bootloader, partial libc implementation, and userspace programs. The project targets systems researchers, kernel developers, and programming language researchers investigating alternative approaches to operating system implementation, demonstrating that high-level languages can achieve competitive performance in low-level system programming contexts traditionally dominated by C/C++.
