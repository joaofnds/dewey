Biscuit is a research operating system kernel written in Go for the x86-64 architecture, designed to explore performance trade-offs in kernel development using a high-level language with garbage collection. Its features include multicore support, kernel-supported threads, a journaled file system, virtual memory management, a TCP/IP stack, and drivers for AHCI SATA disks and Intel 10Gb NICs. This standalone project provides a bootloader, a partial libc implementation, and user-space programs. It requires a modified Go runtime and targets researchers and potentially systems programmers interested in OS kernel design and performance analysis.
