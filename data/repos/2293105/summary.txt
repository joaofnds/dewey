Hunchentoot is a HTTP/1.1 compliant web server and web application framework implemented in Common Lisp, targeting web developers building dynamic server-side applications in the Lisp ecosystem. It provides core web server functionality including SSL/TLS support, persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, automatic session management, request/response handling, and multiprocessing capabilities for concurrent request processing. The server operates as both a standalone HTTP server and a toolkit for web application development, handling TCP/IP socket communications and integrating with Common Lisp compatibility layers like usocket and Bordeaux Threads for cross-implementation portability. It addresses the need for Lisp developers to deploy web applications without relying on external web servers, offering direct access to HTTP primitives while remaining agnostic about HTML generation libraries.
