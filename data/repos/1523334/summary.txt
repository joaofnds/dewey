`json-mode` is an Emacs Lisp package providing a major mode for editing JSON files, enhancing the built-in `js-mode` with improved syntax highlighting and specific editing keybindings. It includes functionality to format JSON using `json-pretty-print`, extract object paths, toggle boolean values, replace sexps with null, and increment/decrement numeric values. The package also offers `jsonc-mode` for editing JSON files that include comments. This is a developer productivity tool, designed as an Emacs extension for Emacs Lisp developers working with JSON data.
