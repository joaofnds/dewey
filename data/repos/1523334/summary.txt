json-mode is an Emacs major mode that extends the built-in js-mode to provide specialized editing capabilities for JSON files. Built in Emacs Lisp, it targets web developers, DevOps engineers, and software developers who frequently work with JSON configuration files, APIs, and data interchange formats. The package enhances JSON editing through improved syntax highlighting, formatting via json-pretty-print, object path navigation using json-snatcher, and specialized keybindings for common JSON operations like toggling boolean values, incrementing numbers, and null replacement. It includes jsonc-mode for JSON with comments (huJSON/JWCC), addressing the need for annotated configuration files. The tool integrates with MELPA package repositories and solves the problem of efficient JSON manipulation within the Emacs development environment.
