CloverBootloader is a multi-platform UEFI and BIOS bootloader implementation written in C, designed for system administrators and advanced users managing multi-boot environments across macOS, Windows, and Linux systems. Built on Intel's EDK2 (EFI Development Kit) framework with components from Chameleon, rEFIt, and XNU, it provides firmware-level boot management with ACPI table manipulation, DSDT patching, and NVRAM control capabilities. The bootloader addresses the technical challenge of cross-platform boot compatibility on both Mac and PC hardware, offering features like custom GUI themes, graphics firmware extraction, HDA audio testing, and EFI shell access. It primarily serves the hackintosh community and system integrators requiring sophisticated boot management beyond standard platform-specific bootloaders, with extensive hardware compatibility and boot environment customization options.
