G2 is a TypeScript-based data visualization library that implements the Grammar of Graphics paradigm for creating interactive charts and dashboards in web applications. Built on the G rendering engine, it supports Canvas, SVG, and WebGL output formats while providing a declarative API for constructing visualizations through composable marks, scales, transforms, and coordinates. The library targets web developers and data visualization engineers who need to build analytical dashboards, exploratory data interfaces, and storytelling visualizations. G2 solves the complexity of creating consistent, extensible chart components by abstracting low-level graphics operations into a functional grammar, enabling rapid development of custom visualizations without requiring deep knowledge of rendering internals. It integrates with React ecosystems and supports advanced features like data-driven animations and interactive behaviors.
