v86 is a web-based x86 PC emulator that implements a complete virtual machine running directly in browsers through JavaScript and WebAssembly. It features runtime machine code translation to WASM modules for performance optimization, emulating Pentium 4-level instruction sets with SSE3 support, plus comprehensive hardware components including FPU, VGA graphics, IDE controllers, network cards, and various I/O devices. The emulator targets web developers, security researchers, and educators needing legacy x86 system virtualization without native desktop software, enabling execution of complete operating systems like Windows 95-2000, Linux distributions, DOS, and FreeBSD entirely within web browsers. It solves cross-platform compatibility issues for legacy software testing, educational demonstrations, and retro computing scenarios through client-side virtualization technology.
