`copy/v86` is a standalone x86 PC emulator designed to run within a web browser, leveraging WebAssembly (WASM) for performance. It emulates x86 architecture, enabling the execution of x86-compatible operating systems and applications directly in a browser environment. The project incorporates an x86-to-WASM just-in-time (JIT) compiler to optimize execution speed. Primarily a software project targeting developers, it provides a platform for virtualizing x86 environments within web applications.
