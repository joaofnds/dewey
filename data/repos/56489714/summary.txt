This repository provides the codebase for generating a technology radar visualization, inspired by the ThoughtWorks Tech Radar. Utilizing `radar.js`, a JavaScript library built upon d3.js v7, it visualizes technology choices through an interactive radar diagram. Functionality includes customizable quadrants, rings, and entries, with automatic positioning to prevent overlap, along with options for print layouts and new tab links. The project is a JavaScript library, deployable as a static web page, and targets engineering teams needing to visualize and communicate technology choices.
