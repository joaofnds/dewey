The Zalando Tech Radar is a D3.js-based data visualization library for creating interactive technology radar charts that help engineering organizations visualize and communicate their technology adoption strategies. Built on D3.js v7, it generates SVG-based radar visualizations with customizable quadrants (technology categories) and concentric rings (adoption stages like "Adopt," "Trial," "Assess," "Hold"). The library provides automatic collision detection for entry positioning, configurable styling, and movement indicators to track technology evolution over time. Designed for engineering teams and technology leaders in software development organizations, it addresses the need for visual technology governance and decision-making alignment across distributed teams. The solution is implemented as a standalone JavaScript library with minimal dependencies, deployable as a static web application for documenting and sharing technology choices within engineering organizations.
