The `arduino/Arduino` repository hosts the legacy 1.x version of the Arduino IDE, a Java-based, open-source integrated development environment (IDE) designed for programming Arduino microcontroller boards. It provides a platform for developing stand-alone interactive objects and interfacing with computer software, facilitating the creation of embedded systems projects. Core functionalities include code editing, compilation for the Wiring/Processing language, and uploading to Arduino hardware.  The project is a standalone GUI application, and it relies on the Java programming language and includes dependencies for AVR and SAM Arduino core libraries, as well as supporting tools and compilers.
