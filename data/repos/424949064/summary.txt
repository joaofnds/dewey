`live_beats` is a web application enabling collaborative music playback, built with Phoenix LiveView. It allows users to play music together through a web interface. The application utilizes Elixir and the Phoenix framework, leveraging features such as GitHub OAuth for user authentication and a database for persistence (implied by `mix ecto.setup`). This is a standalone, example web application demonstrating the capabilities of Phoenix LiveView.
