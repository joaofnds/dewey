LiveBeats is a real-time collaborative music streaming application built with Phoenix LiveView and Elixir, demonstrating modern web development patterns for synchronized user experiences. The application enables multiple users to play and listen to music together in real-time, leveraging Phoenix's WebSocket-based LiveView technology for reactive UI updates without JavaScript frameworks. It implements GitHub OAuth authentication for user management and uses Ecto for database operations with PostgreSQL. The project serves as a reference implementation for web developers learning Phoenix LiveView capabilities, showcasing real-time synchronization, user authentication, and media streaming within the Elixir ecosystem. Target users include Elixir/Phoenix developers seeking practical examples of building interactive, real-time web applications with server-side rendering and minimal client-side JavaScript.
