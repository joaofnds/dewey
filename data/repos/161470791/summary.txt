Oak is a cross-platform HTTP middleware framework written in TypeScript that provides Koa-inspired request/response handling for modern JavaScript runtimes including Deno, Node.js, Bun, and Cloudflare Workers. It targets web developers building server-side applications and APIs who need a lightweight, Express/Koa-style middleware stack with routing capabilities. The framework implements standard HTTP server patterns including middleware composition, context passing, cookie handling, and request/response processing while abstracting runtime differences across platforms. Oak solves the problem of building consistent web applications across different JavaScript environments, offering familiar middleware patterns for developers migrating from Node.js ecosystems or building new applications on alternative runtimes like Deno and edge computing platforms.
