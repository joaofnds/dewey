debtap is a shell script utility designed for Linux system administration and package management, specifically targeting Arch Linux users who need to convert Debian (.deb) packages into native Arch Linux packages. The tool addresses cross-distribution compatibility issues by accurately translating package metadata, dependencies, and file structures from Debian's packaging format to Arch's pkg.tar format. Built using bash scripting with dependencies on binutils, pkgfile, and fakeroot, debtap performs comprehensive package analysis including dependency resolution, conflict detection, and metadata preservation rather than simple repackaging. It serves system administrators and advanced Arch Linux users who encounter closed-source software or packages unavailable in the Arch User Repository (AUR), providing both direct package conversion and PKGBUILD generation capabilities for manual customization and building.
