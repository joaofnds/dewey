`debtap` is a command-line utility written in Shell for converting Debian (.deb) packages into Arch Linux packages. It focuses on accuracy, generating Arch Linux packages or PKGBUILD files from .deb packages, particularly useful for closed-source software or packages unavailable in the Arch User Repository (AUR). Key functionalities include database updates, pseudo-64-bit package creation, dependency version wiping, and optional generation of PKGBUILD files. It depends on `bash`, `binutils` (with `ar` and `readelf`), `pkgfile`, and `fakeroot`.
