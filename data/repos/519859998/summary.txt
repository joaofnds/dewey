AFFiNE is an open-source knowledge management and collaborative workspace application built with TypeScript, Rust, and Electron for cross-platform deployment. It combines document editing, whiteboard functionality, and database management into a unified canvas-based interface, positioning itself as an alternative to Notion and Miro. The system implements CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for real-time collaboration, supports local-first data storage with cloud synchronization, and features markdown editing capabilities. Built on the BlockSuite framework, it targets knowledge workers, project managers, and teams requiring integrated note-taking, visual planning, and data organization tools. The application supports self-hosting and aims to provide extensibility through plugin architecture for customizable productivity workflows.
