Dgraph is a horizontally scalable, distributed graph database written in Go that provides native GraphQL query support with ACID transactions and consistent replication. It targets enterprise applications and knowledge graph use cases where complex relational data needs real-time querying at scale, serving developers and data engineers working with interconnected datasets that don't fit well in traditional SQL schemas. The database optimizes disk layout for graph traversals and supports both JSON and Protocol Buffer responses over gRPC and HTTP APIs. It addresses the performance limitations of traditional relational databases when handling sparse, highly connected data requiring complex joins and graph operations, making it suitable for applications like knowledge management systems, recommendation engines, and social networks requiring sub-second query responses over terabytes of structured data.
