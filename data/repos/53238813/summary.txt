Homebrew is a command-line package manager written in Ruby that automates the installation, management, and dependency resolution of software packages on macOS and Linux systems. Targeting developers, system administrators, and power users, it solves the problem of missing native package management on macOS by providing a Git-based formula system that compiles software from source or installs pre-built binaries. The system uses Ruby DSL scripts called "formulae" to define package build instructions, manages installations in isolated directories (Cellar), and supports extensibility through "taps" (third-party repositories). Homebrew handles complex dependency trees, version management, and system integration while maintaining package isolation, making it essential infrastructure for development environment setup and system administration in Unix-like environments.
