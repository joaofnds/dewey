Juniper is a Go library that extends the standard library with generic-based data structures, containers, and stream processing utilities. It provides type-safe implementations of common data structures including B-tree-based sorted maps/sets, double-ended queues, priority queues, and linked lists, alongside iterator and stream interfaces with functional programming combinators like map, reduce, and filter. The library targets Go developers building systems requiring efficient data manipulation, concurrent processing, and I/O-heavy operations, offering ergonomic alternatives to standard library containers with better performance characteristics. Key modules include container types (tree, deque, heap), slice operations, parallel processing utilities, and extensions to core packages like sort, sync, and math, solving the problem of Go's limited generic container ecosystem.
