Juniper is a Go library providing extensions to the standard library, focusing on generic-based data structures and utility functions. It offers implementations of sorted maps and sets using B-trees, double-ended queues, min-heaps with priority queue capabilities, and type-safe linked lists. Key features include iterator and stream interfaces for enhanced data manipulation, parallel processing utilities for slices, iterators, and streams, and extensions to the `sort` package. This developer-focused project is a library designed to improve developer productivity within Go projects by providing data structure and utility implementations.
