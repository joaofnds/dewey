Screego is a self-hosted screen sharing server built in Go that addresses low-quality, high-latency screen sharing issues common in corporate communication tools like Microsoft Teams. Designed specifically for developers who need to share code with colleagues, it leverages WebRTC for peer-to-peer connections to deliver low-latency, high-resolution screen sharing sessions. The application includes an integrated TURN server for NAT traversal, supports multi-user screenshare sessions, and can be deployed via Docker containers or as a single binary. This developer-focused tool serves the software development and DevOps domains, providing a privacy-conscious alternative to corporate screen sharing solutions by enabling teams to self-host their own screen sharing infrastructure with superior performance characteristics for code review and collaborative development scenarios.
