`screego/server` is a self-hosted screen-sharing application designed for developers, enabling low-latency, high-resolution screen sharing with multiple users. Built with Go, it leverages WebRTC for secure data transfer and includes a built-in TURN server for NAT traversal. Offered as a standalone application, it provides straightforward deployment via Docker or a single binary, addressing the limitations of screen sharing within corporate communication platforms.
