Kiali is a management console and observability platform specifically designed for Istio service mesh environments, targeting DevOps engineers and platform administrators working with microservices architectures on Kubernetes. Built in Go with a Node.js frontend, it provides real-time visualization, monitoring, and management capabilities for service mesh traffic, configuration, and health metrics. The platform integrates with OpenShift and standard Kubernetes clusters to deliver comprehensive insights into service-to-service communication, security policies, and distributed tracing within Istio-managed environments. Kiali addresses the complexity of monitoring and troubleshooting microservices by offering a centralized dashboard that translates service mesh telemetry data into actionable visualizations, enabling operators to understand traffic flows, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate security configurations across their distributed applications.
