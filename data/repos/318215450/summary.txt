Marginalia is an Emacs Lisp package that enhances the minibuffer completion interface by adding contextual annotations to completion candidates. Built for the Emacs text editor ecosystem, it integrates with completion frameworks like Vertico, Icomplete, and Consult to display helpful metadata (file permissions, command descriptions, variable classifications) alongside completion options. The package operates through a category-based annotation system that automatically detects completion contexts (files, commands, variables) and provides relevant information without modifying the original candidates. Targeted at Emacs power users and developers who rely heavily on minibuffer completion for navigation and command execution, Marginalia solves the problem of lacking contextual information during completion selection, improving workflow efficiency through enhanced visual feedback in the completion interface.
