Cheerio is a server-side HTML/XML parsing and manipulation library for Node.js that implements jQuery's DOM manipulation API without browser dependencies. Built in TypeScript, it leverages htmlparser2 and parse5 parsers to create a lightweight DOM representation for programmatic document traversal and modification. The library targets web developers, data engineers, and automation specialists working on web scraping, HTML processing, server-side rendering, and automated testing scenarios. It provides jQuery-compatible selectors, DOM manipulation methods, and HTML rendering capabilities optimized for server environments where traditional browser-based jQuery cannot operate. Primary use cases include content extraction from web pages, HTML template processing, automated testing of markup, and building web scraping tools that require familiar jQuery syntax for DOM operations.
