The elm/compiler repository contains the core compiler implementation for the Elm programming language, a statically-typed functional language that compiles to JavaScript for web development. Built in Haskell, this compiler transforms Elm source code into optimized JavaScript output, providing type checking, static analysis, and compile-time error detection to eliminate runtime exceptions in web applications. The compiler targets frontend web developers seeking memory safety, immutability, and reliable user interfaces without the common pitfalls of JavaScript development. It serves as the foundational toolchain component that enables Elm's approach to functional reactive programming for single-page applications, handling parsing, type inference, optimization, and JavaScript code generation while enforcing Elm's strict type system and architectural patterns.
