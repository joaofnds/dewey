The `elm/compiler` repository provides the compiler for Elm, a functional programming language designed for building reliable web applications. Written in Haskell, this project translates Elm source code into JavaScript, enabling the development of front-end web applications. It is a standalone compiler application crucial for the Elm ecosystem, empowering developers to write robust and maintainable front-end code with a focus on error prevention.
