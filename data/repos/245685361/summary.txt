CodeTour is a Visual Studio Code extension built in TypeScript that enables developers to create and consume guided walkthroughs of codebases directly within the editor. Targeting software development teams and open-source communities, it addresses code comprehension, developer onboarding, and knowledge transfer challenges by allowing users to record interactive step-by-step tours that annotate specific files, lines, and code selections with markdown descriptions. The extension integrates with VS Code's tree view and comment system to provide navigation controls and tour management capabilities. Tours are persisted as JSON files that can be version-controlled alongside source code or exported for sharing, making it particularly valuable for code reviews, bug reproduction, architectural explanations, and reducing time-to-productivity for new team members joining complex codebases.
