`microsoft/codetour` is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance developer onboarding, code review understanding, and knowledge sharing by enabling the creation and playback of guided code walkthroughs. It allows developers to record interactive "code tours" directly within the editor, associating steps with specific files, lines, or directories, incorporating descriptions with markdown. The extension facilitates the creation of tours in TypeScript that can be checked into repositories or exported for sharing without code dependencies, incorporating features such as versioning with git refs, integration with GitHub Gists, and a tree view interface. This developer productivity tool targets software engineers and teams looking to improve code comprehension and collaboration.
