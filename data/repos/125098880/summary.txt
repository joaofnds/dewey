Proton is a Windows-to-Linux game compatibility layer developed by Valve Software for Steam Play, enabling Windows-exclusive games to run natively on Linux systems. Built primarily in C++ and leveraging Wine as its core translation engine, Proton integrates additional components including DXVK for DirectX-to-Vulkan translation, custom Windows libraries, and game-specific compatibility patches. The tool operates within containerized build environments using Docker/Podman and targets both Steam users seeking seamless Windows game execution on Linux and advanced developers requiring customizable Wine configurations. Proton addresses the fundamental gaming ecosystem fragmentation between Windows and Linux platforms by providing automated API translation, Windows runtime emulation, and Steam client integration, effectively expanding Linux gaming compatibility without requiring game developers to create native Linux ports.
