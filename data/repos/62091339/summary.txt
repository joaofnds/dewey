kOps (Kubernetes Operations) is a production-grade cluster lifecycle management tool written in Go that automates the installation, upgrade, and maintenance of Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform administrators, it provisions underlying cloud infrastructure while managing the complete Kubernetes cluster lifecycle on AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, OpenStack, and Azure. As a CNCF project, kOps functions as "kubectl for clusters," abstracting away the complexity of cloud-specific Kubernetes deployments through declarative configuration and infrastructure-as-code principles. It solves the operational challenge of maintaining highly available, production-ready Kubernetes environments by automating cluster provisioning, scaling, and updates while handling cloud provider integrations, networking, and security configurations essential for enterprise container orchestration deployments.
