Flyradar is a Rust-based terminal user interface (TUI) application for managing and monitoring Fly.io cloud platform resources, targeting DevOps engineers and developers working with Fly.io deployments. Built as a third-party tool inspired by k9s (Kubernetes TUI), it provides keyboard-driven operational workflows for viewing, monitoring, and managing Fly.io applications, virtual machines, volumes, and secrets directly from the terminal. The application integrates with the Fly CLI for authentication and uses a patched async-nats crate for IPC communication with the Fly agent, implementing Rust equivalents of core flyctl components including agent communication, logging, and WireGuard networking functionality. It focuses specifically on operational tasks rather than resource creation, offering real-time monitoring, log filtering, and resource management capabilities for existing Fly.io infrastructure.
