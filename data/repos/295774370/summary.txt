The `mdn/content` repository houses the source content for MDN Web Docs, a comprehensive, open-source documentation project covering web technologies. It provides reference documentation and learning resources for CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Web APIs, targeting web developers and students. Built using Markdown, the project is designed for collaborative content creation and is intended to be built locally using Node.js and Yarn, with a local preview available. This project primarily serves as a documentation resource.
