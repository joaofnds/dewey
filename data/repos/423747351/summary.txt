Rune is an experimental systems programming language developed by Google to explore security and efficiency improvements in low-level programming. Built with C and designed for systems programmers, Rune targets memory-intensive applications where performance and security are critical. The language features constant-time processing of dedicated "secret" types to prevent timing attacks, memory safety guarantees, and Structure-of-Array (SoA) memory management for improved cache performance. Rune integrates DataDraw-inspired code generation to create optimized data structures and relational programming constructs, aiming to outperform C++ in memory-bound scenarios while maintaining C/C++ library interoperability. The Python-inspired syntax makes it accessible to developers transitioning from higher-level languages to systems programming, addressing cryptographic security vulnerabilities and memory management inefficiencies common in traditional systems languages.
