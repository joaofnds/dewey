Rune is a systems programming language designed to enhance security and efficiency, particularly for memory-intensive applications by integrating features for "secret" types and relational data structures with optimal memory layout using a Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) approach. The language provides memory safety, constant-time processing of secrets, and aims to be faster than C++ for certain benchmarks, utilizing code generation from declarative data structure descriptions akin to "DataDraw." This project is a compiler, implemented in C, along with dependencies including Bison, Flex, GNU MP, Clang, DataDraw, and CTTK for constant-time arithmetic. The project is currently unfinished, but the described features suggest a target audience of systems programmers and developers working on performance-critical or security-sensitive applications.
