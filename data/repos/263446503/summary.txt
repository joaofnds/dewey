This repository provides a faithful C++ implementation of the Smalltalk-80 programming environment based on the original "Bluebook" specification from Xerox PARC. It recreates the complete object-oriented runtime system including garbage collection (both reference counting and mark-sweep), virtual machine interpreter, and graphical user interface using SDL for cross-platform compatibility across macOS, Windows, Linux, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD. The implementation targets programming language researchers, computer science educators, and developers interested in historical computing systems or pure object-oriented programming environments. It solves the problem of accessing authentic Smalltalk-80 functionality on modern systems, providing a minimalist alternative to contemporary Smalltalk variants like Squeak or Pharo while maintaining compatibility with original Alto-based virtual images and supporting POSIX file system integration for practical development work.
