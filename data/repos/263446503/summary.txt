This repository implements a Smalltalk-80 system, replicating the "Bluebook" specification and making it runnable across multiple operating systems. Written primarily in C, the project offers a fully functional Smalltalk environment, including a graphical user interface, file system integration, and debugging tools.  Key features encompass the Smalltalk interpreter, garbage collection based on both Mark and Sweep and reference counting, and configuration options for interpreter behavior and object memory management. It is a standalone application, intended for those interested in exploring or working with the classic Smalltalk language and its associated development environment, with building and running instructions for OS X, Windows, Linux, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD provided.
