kafkactl is a command-line interface tool written in Go for managing and interacting with Apache Kafka clusters, targeting DevOps engineers, data engineers, and system administrators working with streaming data infrastructure. The tool provides comprehensive Kafka administration capabilities including topic management, message consumption/production, consumer group monitoring, and schema registry integration with support for Avro and Protobuf serialization formats. Key features include multi-context configuration management, Kubernetes integration for accessing containerized Kafka clusters, SASL/TLS authentication support, and shell auto-completion for bash/zsh/fish. It solves the problem of complex Kafka cluster management by providing a unified CLI interface that abstracts away the complexity of direct Kafka API interactions, enabling efficient operations across different environments from local development to production Kubernetes deployments.
