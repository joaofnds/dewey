`kafkactl` is a command-line tool written in Go designed for managing Apache Kafka clusters. It provides functionalities to interact with Kafka, implied by its inclusion of `apache-kafka` and `kafka` topics, while leveraging features likely related to data serialization/deserialization through the `avro` topic. The tool's structure suggests it is a standalone CLI application, offering a developer-centric interface for managing Kafka environments, with specific integrations for `fish` and `zsh` suggesting shell scripting support. This project is targeted at system administrators and developers who work with Kafka and need a tool to manage and interact with their clusters efficiently.
