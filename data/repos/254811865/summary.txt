`weir` is a Common Lisp library designed for creating generative art systems, providing tools for 2D/3D vector operations, random number generation, and a graph data structure for managing vertices and edges. It features a system of "alterations" for queuing and applying changes to the graph. Core functionalities include drawing SVGs and PNGs with a focus on plotting, along with support for geometric calculations and spline manipulation. The project is a library intended for generative art applications and incorporates dependencies managed by Quicklisp.
