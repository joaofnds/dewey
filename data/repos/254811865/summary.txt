Weir is a deprecated Common Lisp library designed for generative art and algorithmic visual creation. It provides a comprehensive toolkit including 2D/3D vector operations, random number generation utilities, graph data structures for vertex/edge manipulation, and specialized modules for color handling (pigment), BÃ©zier splines (bzspl), and path processing. The library targets digital artists and creative coders working with procedural graphics generation, offering mathematical primitives for geometric transformations, probabilistic functions for algorithmic randomness, and graph-based structures for complex visual pattern creation. Built specifically for SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp), it serves as a foundation for building generative art systems, replacing the author's previous "snek" library with enhanced functionality for computational creativity and algorithmic art workflows.
