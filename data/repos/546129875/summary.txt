Rio is a cross-platform terminal emulator built in Rust that leverages GPU acceleration through WGPU for high-performance text rendering on desktop environments (macOS, Linux, Windows) and web browsers via WebAssembly. Targeting developers and system administrators who require responsive terminal interfaces, Rio addresses performance bottlenecks in traditional CPU-based terminal rendering by utilizing hardware acceleration for improved frame rates and reduced latency. The project builds upon Alacritty's ANSI parser and event processing foundation while implementing its own GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline using the Sugarloaf graphics engine. Rio serves the developer tools ecosystem by providing a modern alternative to legacy terminal emulators, particularly beneficial for users running resource-intensive CLI applications, multiple terminal sessions, or requiring smooth visual effects like transparency and CRT styling.
