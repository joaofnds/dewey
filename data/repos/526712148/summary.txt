This repository is a curated awesome-list that catalogs projects, tools, and resources built around Cosmopolitan Libc, a C library that enables "build-once run-anywhere" executables without virtual machines or interpreters. The collection primarily targets systems programmers and web developers working on cross-platform deployment challenges, featuring three main technology categories: Cosmopolitan Libc itself for creating Actually Portable Executables (APEs), Redbean for single-file web servers that run across multiple operating systems, and Fullmoon as a minimalistic web framework. The repository addresses the fundamental problem of binary portability across Linux, macOS, Windows, and BSD systems, providing developers with tools to eliminate traditional compilation and deployment complexity while maintaining native performance across diverse computing environments.
