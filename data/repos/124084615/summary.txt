`parinfer-rust` is a Rust port of the Parinfer library, a developer productivity tool focused on manipulating code indentation and structure automatically. It's designed to assist in editing languages structured like Lisp, such as Clojure and Scheme, and integrates with text editors like Kakoune and Vim, likely through plugins. This project provides the core Parinfer functionality, enabling users to maintain code formatting correctly as they edit code. It functions as a library and is likely targeted towards developers working with Lisp-family languages who use these editors.
