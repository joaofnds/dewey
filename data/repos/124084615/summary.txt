parinfer-rust is a Rust implementation of Parinfer, a code formatting tool that automatically infers and manages parentheses in Lisp-family languages including Clojure, Scheme, and Lisp. It provides editor plugins for Vim, Neovim, Kakoune, and Emacs, implementing "smart mode" that dynamically switches between parentheses and indentation management based on user editing context. The tool compiles to a dynamic library for cross-editor integration and supports WebAssembly builds using nightly Rust toolchain. It addresses the core problem of parentheses balancing in s-expression-based languages, significantly improving developer productivity when writing functional code. The project targets software developers working in functional programming languages who use text editors rather than full IDEs, providing seamless structural editing capabilities through native plugins.
