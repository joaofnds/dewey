This repository provides a complete GraphQL implementation for the Go programming language, targeting backend web developers building API services. It follows the official GraphQL-JS reference implementation and supports the full GraphQL specification including queries, mutations, and subscriptions. The library enables Go developers to define GraphQL schemas programmatically using Go structs and interfaces, with resolver functions that handle data fetching and manipulation. It addresses the need for type-safe, efficient API development in Go-based web services, allowing developers to create flexible, client-driven APIs that can replace traditional REST endpoints. The implementation includes comprehensive schema definition tools, query execution engines, and validation mechanisms, making it suitable for building modern web applications, microservices, and API gateways where GraphQL's declarative data fetching capabilities are preferred over REST architectures.
