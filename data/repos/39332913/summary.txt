This repository provides a Go implementation of GraphQL, a query language for APIs, mirroring the functionality of the official `graphql-js` reference implementation. It supports queries, mutations, and subscriptions. The library enables developers to define GraphQL schemas and execute queries against them within Go applications, as demonstrated by a provided "hello world" example and a collection of supporting third-party libraries, including a handler for HTTP requests and a Relay integration. It is a library intended for backend developers building APIs using the Go programming language.
