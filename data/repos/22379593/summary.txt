**centered-window-mode** is an Emacs Lisp package that implements a global minor mode for text editor ergonomics, specifically targeting the Emacs ecosystem. The package automatically centers text content within Emacs windows when only one window is visible, reverting to normal layout when multiple windows are displayed or when window width falls below a configurable threshold (`cwm-centered-window-width`). Built entirely in Emacs Lisp, it integrates with Emacs' native window management system and customization framework, offering optional vertical padding through frame border manipulation. The package addresses visual comfort and readability concerns for developers, writers, and technical documentation authors who spend extended periods reading and editing text in Emacs, particularly beneficial for wide monitors where centered text reduces eye strain and improves focus.
