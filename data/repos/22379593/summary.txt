`centered-window-mode` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to center text content within a single Emacs window, enhancing readability. This plugin addresses the challenge of off-center text presentation when only one window is open. It leverages Emacs Lisp and interacts directly with the Emacs environment to manage and resize windows, specifically targeting users of the Emacs text editor.
