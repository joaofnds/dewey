nvim-compe is a deprecated Lua-based auto-completion plugin for Neovim 0.5+ that provides intelligent code completion for software developers. The plugin implements a fuzzy matching algorithm and integrates with Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients, supporting various completion sources including buffer text, file paths, calculations, Neovim Lua API, and snippet engines like vsnip, ultisnips, and luasnip. It features VSCode-compatible expansion handling, supports advanced LSP completion features like trigger characters and incremental completion, and offers a flexible custom source API for extending functionality. The plugin targets developers working in any programming language supported by LSP, providing enhanced productivity through context-aware autocompletion in the Neovim text editor environment. Users configure the plugin through Lua or Vimscript and it has been succeeded by nvim-cmp.
