This repository contains a React-based web application that provides online conversion of AAX (Audible audiobook) files to standard audio formats. Built with JavaScript and ReactJS, the application serves as a client-side interface for audiobook format conversion, targeting the digital media processing domain. The project is deployed via GitHub Pages and integrates with a separate API service for the actual file conversion functionality. It addresses the need for users to convert proprietary Audible audiobook files into more accessible audio formats without requiring desktop software installation. The target users are audiobook consumers and digital media enthusiasts who need to convert AAX files for cross-platform compatibility or personal media library management.
