Fira Math is a specialized OpenType font designed for mathematical typesetting, providing Unicode math support in a sans-serif style. Built as a fork of FiraSans and FiraGO fonts, it targets the academic publishing and scientific document preparation domain, specifically serving LaTeX, ConTeXt, and Microsoft Word users who require mathematical notation rendering. The font integrates with the unicode-math package ecosystem and supports XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX compilation workflows. Development uses Python-based font generation tools including glyphsLib and Glyphs 3 editor, with TeX packaging for distribution through CTAN and TeX Live/MiKTeX package managers. It addresses the need for consistent, high-quality mathematical symbol rendering for researchers, academics, and technical writers who produce scientific documents with complex mathematical expressions.
