This repository implements a web-based multimedia recording application using HTML5 MediaRecorder API and JavaScript to capture audio, video, and screen content directly in the browser. Built for the web development domain, it leverages native browser APIs (getUserMedia, getDisplayMedia) to access device cameras, microphones, and screen sharing capabilities without requiring additional plugins or desktop software. The application addresses the need for a lightweight, open-source recording solution that runs entirely client-side, eliminating dependency on proprietary desktop recording applications. Primary users include web developers, content creators, and technical professionals who require basic recording functionality integrated into web workflows or prefer browser-based tools over traditional desktop recording software for simplicity and cross-platform compatibility.
