Pino is a high-performance JSON logger library for Node.js applications designed to minimize overhead in production environments. Built for web development and backend services, it provides structured logging with extremely low latency by leveraging asynchronous processing and worker threads for log transport operations. The library integrates with major Node.js web frameworks including Express, Fastify, Hapi, and Koa, outputting machine-readable JSON logs suitable for centralized logging systems and observability platforms. Pino addresses the critical performance bottleneck of logging in high-throughput applications by being 5x faster than alternative logging solutions, while supporting features like child loggers, log redaction, pretty-printing for development, and bundling compatibility with webpack/esbuild for modern JavaScript applications.
