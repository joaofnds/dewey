Datahike is a durable Datalog database engine written in Clojure that provides immutable, distributed data storage with compositional querying capabilities. Built as a port of DataScript enhanced with hitchhiker-tree data structures and konserve storage backends, it targets Clojure/ClojureScript developers building data-intensive applications requiring persistent storage, temporal queries, and schema enforcement. The system offers a Datomic-compatible API subset, supporting ACID transactions, historical data access, and flexible storage backends including filesystem, memory, and distributed options. Primary use cases include web applications, data analysis workflows, and systems requiring immutable audit trails, appealing to functional programming practitioners who need a lightweight alternative to traditional SQL databases while maintaining Datalog's powerful relational query semantics and time-travel capabilities.
