Datahike is a Clojure library providing a fast, immutable, distributed, and compositional Datalog engine, functioning as a database. It offers functionalities akin to Datomic, including Datalog querying, transactions, schema definition, and data storage, while leveraging the hitchhiker-tree for efficient data structures. The project is designed as a drop-in replacement for a subset of Datomic, targeted towards Clojure developers and those seeking an open-source alternative, and includes features like data migration and support for GDPR compliance. It provides a core API for interaction, utilizes the Clojure ecosystem, and supports file-based storage.
