`htop` is a cross-platform, interactive process viewer providing real-time monitoring of running processes on Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems. Written in C, it utilizes the `ncurses` library for terminal-based display and user interaction, allowing users to scroll, sort, filter, and manage processes, including killing and renicing, directly within the terminal. Key features include displaying CPU and memory consumption, system load averages, and customizable process information. The project is a standalone command-line application, aimed at system administrators and users needing a detailed and interactive system monitoring tool.
