htop is a cross-platform interactive process monitoring utility written in C, serving as an enhanced alternative to the traditional Unix `top` command for system administrators and DevOps professionals. Built on ncurses libraries, it provides a terminal-based interface for real-time visualization of system processes, CPU usage, memory consumption, and system load metrics across Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms. The tool addresses the need for efficient process management and system monitoring by enabling interactive sorting, filtering, and process control (killing, renicing) without requiring PID lookup. Supporting advanced features like CPU affinity management, hardware topology awareness through hwloc, temperature monitoring via libsensors, and Linux capabilities, htop targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who require detailed system performance analysis and process management capabilities in console environments.
