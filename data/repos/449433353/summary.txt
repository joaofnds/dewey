Numbr is a TypeScript-based web application and Chrome extension that functions as a hybrid notepad-calculator for productivity and web browsing workflows. Built for the web platform with browser extension capabilities, it targets general users, analysts, and professionals who need contextual mathematical computations within text documents. The application implements real-time arithmetic parsing, currency conversion APIs, variable assignment, and context-aware calculation processing that ignores surrounding text while evaluating numerical expressions. Key features include support for financial notations (k/M suffixes, currency symbols), multi-line summation, and shareable calculation sessions via URL state management. It addresses the common workflow friction of switching between text editors and calculator applications during financial analysis, note-taking, and data entry tasks.
