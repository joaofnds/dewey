org-roam-server is a web visualization tool for Emacs users working with org-roam v1, a note-taking system built on Org-mode. The application serves as a bridge between Emacs and web browsers, providing an interactive graph visualization of interconnected notes stored in the org-roam database. Built with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Elisp, it creates a local web server that renders note relationships using vis-network for graph visualization, jQuery for DOM manipulation, and Bootstrap for UI components. The tool integrates with org-roam protocol to enable seamless navigation between the web interface and Emacs buffers, targeting knowledge workers, researchers, and writers who use Emacs for personal knowledge management and need visual representations of their note networks.
