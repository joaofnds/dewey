`org-roam-server` is a web application designed to visualize and interact with an Org-Roam database, specifically for Org-Roam v1. Functionality includes a web-based graph representation of notes, allowing users to navigate between files within Emacs via a clickable interface that leverages the Org-Roam protocol. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and likely leveraging a backend within Emacs, this project serves as a standalone web application, and is intended for Emacs users managing notes using Org-Roam.
