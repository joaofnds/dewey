Dragonfly is a high-performance in-memory data store implemented in C++ that serves as a drop-in replacement for Redis and Memcached in distributed systems and caching architectures. Built for DevOps and backend developers, it provides full API compatibility with Redis/Memcached while leveraging modern multi-threading, fiber-based concurrency, and vertical scaling to achieve significantly higher throughput and lower latency. The system targets web applications, microservices, and high-load distributed systems requiring fast key-value storage, caching layers, and message brokering capabilities. Key technologies include C++ for core implementation, fiber-based asynchronous programming, and NoSQL data structures, addressing the performance bottlenecks of single-threaded legacy in-memory databases while maintaining seamless integration with existing Redis/Memcached-dependent applications.
