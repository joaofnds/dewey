Dragonfly is a high-performance, in-memory data store designed as a modern replacement for Redis and Memcached, targeting cloud workloads. Written in C++, it provides key-value storage with support for Redis and Memcached APIs, delivering significantly higher throughput and lower latency compared to legacy in-memory datastores. Key features include compatibility with existing Redis/Memcached clients, multi-threading via a shared-nothing architecture for CPU utilization, a novel cache eviction algorithm, and a fork-less snapshotting mechanism. This standalone application offers functionalities like data persistence, configurable ports, and Prometheus-compatible metrics, serving as a database and cache solution for developers.
