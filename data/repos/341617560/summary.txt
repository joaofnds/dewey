This repository provides a sample Node.js application demonstrating Redis integration patterns for web developers learning NoSQL data management. Built with JavaScript and the IORedis client library, it implements a social network-style check-in system where users rate locations, showcasing Redis data structures including Hashes, Sets, and geospatial indexing. The application demonstrates Redis as both primary datastore and cache layer, utilizing Redis modules like RedisJSON for document storage and RediSearch for location-based queries. Designed as educational content for the Redis Labs Node.js crash course, it targets backend developers seeking hands-on experience with Redis data modeling, API development, and NoSQL database operations in modern web applications.
