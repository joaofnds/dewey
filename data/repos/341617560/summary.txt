This repository provides the source code and instructions for a Node.js-based crash course demonstrating how to use Redis as a data store and cache within a sample social network application. It showcases building an application with four interconnected components, including an authentication service, check-in receiver, check-in processor, and API server, demonstrating functionalities like user, location, and check-in data management leveraging Redis data types and modules such as RediSearch and RedisJSON. Built with JavaScript using Node.js, the Express framework, and the ioredis client, this example project aims to teach developers practical Redis integration techniques through a hands-on, example-driven approach. This is a template project designed to demonstrate the use of Redis with Node.js.
