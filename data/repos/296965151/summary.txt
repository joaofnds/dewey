aerial.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides a hierarchical code outline window for navigating source code structures. It integrates with Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients and Tree-sitter parsers to extract and display code symbols like functions, classes, variables, and other structural elements in a navigable sidebar. The plugin supports over 40 programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, C++, and TypeScript, targeting software developers working across multiple language ecosystems. It offers seamless integration with popular Neovim tools like Telescope, fzf, and Lualine, providing commands for symbol navigation, jumping between code sections, and maintaining code context awareness. The tool solves the problem of navigating large codebases by offering a bird's-eye view of file structure, enabling quick traversal between functions and classes without scrolling through entire files.
