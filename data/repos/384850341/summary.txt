fzf-lua is a Neovim plugin that provides a native Lua implementation of fuzzy finding capabilities, serving as an enhanced replacement for fzf.vim. Targeting software developers using Neovim as their primary editor, it integrates the popular fzf command-line fuzzy finder with Neovim's Lua API to enable fast file navigation, buffer switching, grep searching, and code exploration. The plugin leverages external tools like ripgrep, fd, and bat for enhanced performance, while providing features like live grep, git integration, LSP symbol searching, and DAP debugging support. It addresses the core developer workflow problem of efficiently navigating large codebases and project files within the Neovim text editor environment, offering improved performance and extensibility over its Vimscript predecessor through native Lua implementation.
