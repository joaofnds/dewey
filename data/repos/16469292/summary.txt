TextQL is a Go-based command-line tool that enables SQL query execution against structured text files (CSV, TSV) by leveraging SQLite's in-memory database engine. Targeting data analysts, system administrators, and developers in data processing workflows, it bridges Unix pipe operations with SQL analytics capabilities. The tool automatically detects numeric and datetime values, supports multi-file joins, and provides flexible I/O options including stdin/stdout integration for shell scripting. Key features include customizable delimiters, header row handling, pretty-printed output, and optional SQLite database persistence. It solves the common problem of analyzing structured text data without requiring full database imports, making it particularly valuable for ad-hoc data analysis, log processing, and ETL pipelines where SQL's analytical power is needed on flat file formats.
