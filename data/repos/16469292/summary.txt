`textql` is a Go-based command-line application that enables SQL queries against structured text data formats such as CSV and TSV. It provides SQL-like querying capabilities for analyzing and manipulating tabular data stored in plain text files. As a standalone CLI application, `textql` allows users to perform data transformations, filtering, and aggregations directly on text files using the familiar SQL syntax, eliminating the need for external database imports.
