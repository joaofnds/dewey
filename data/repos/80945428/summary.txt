NestJS is a TypeScript-first Node.js framework for building enterprise-grade server-side applications, targeting backend web developers who need structured, scalable API development. Built on Express.js (with Fastify compatibility), it implements Angular-inspired architecture using decorators, dependency injection, and modular design patterns. The framework addresses the architectural fragmentation problem in Node.js backend development by providing opinionated structure for REST APIs, GraphQL services, microservices, and WebSocket applications. It combines object-oriented programming, functional programming, and reactive programming paradigms, offering built-in support for TypeScript while maintaining JavaScript compatibility. NestJS serves enterprise developers, full-stack engineers, and teams building complex server-side applications who require testable, maintainable codebases with robust architectural foundations.
