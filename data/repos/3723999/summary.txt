This repository provides a comprehensive Emacs major mode for Haskell programming language development, implemented in Emacs Lisp. It targets functional programming developers working with Haskell by offering syntax highlighting, code editing, debugging, and REPL integration capabilities within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. The mode integrates with Haskell toolchain components like GHC, Cabal, and Stack to provide features such as interactive development, type checking, and project management. It addresses the core problem of providing a robust IDE-like experience for Haskell developers who prefer Emacs as their primary development environment. The package is distributed through standard Emacs package repositories (MELPA, GNU ELPA) and serves Haskell programmers, functional programming enthusiasts, and Emacs users requiring advanced language support for functional programming workflows in academic, research, and commercial software development contexts.
