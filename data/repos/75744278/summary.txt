`oklog/ulid` is a Go library providing Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers (ULIDs), an alternative to UUIDs, designed for use in distributed systems. It offers features like monotonic ordering within milliseconds, compatibility with UUIDs, and URL-safe string encoding using Crockford's base32. Key functionalities include ULID generation via `Make` and `New` functions, parsing, and a command-line tool for generation and time conversion. This library is designed as a developer productivity tool, specifically targeting Go developers needing unique, sortable identifiers for data structures and distributed systems.
