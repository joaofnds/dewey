This Go library implements Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifiers (ULIDs), providing a UUID alternative optimized for database and distributed systems applications. Built for backend developers and system architects, it generates 128-bit identifiers that are lexicographically sortable, more compact than standard UUIDs (26 vs 36 characters), and use Crockford's base32 encoding for URL-safe representation. The library addresses database fragmentation issues caused by randomly distributed UUIDs by combining millisecond-precision timestamps with configurable entropy sources, supporting both cryptographically secure (crypto/rand) and performance-optimized (math/rand) random generation. Key features include monotonic ordering within milliseconds, Go modules compatibility, and flexible entropy source configuration for concurrent applications requiring high-performance ID generation in microservices and data storage systems.
