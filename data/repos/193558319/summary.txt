This repository is a comprehensive TypeScript template for creating GitHub Actions, targeting DevOps automation and CI/CD pipeline development. It provides a complete development framework including TypeScript compilation, Jest testing, ESLint code quality checks, automated workflows for validation and publishing, and semantic versioning scripts. The template integrates key GitHub Actions technologies including the @actions/core toolkit, Rollup bundling for distribution, and automated dependency license management. It serves as a production-ready starting point for developers building custom GitHub Actions to automate software workflows, replacing manual CI/CD processes with reusable, type-safe automation components. The solution addresses the complexity of GitHub Actions development by providing pre-configured tooling, testing infrastructure, and deployment pipelines for TypeScript-based automation scripts.
