**awesome-vue** is a comprehensive, community-curated directory of Vue.js ecosystem resources and tools for web developers. This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base cataloging Vue.js frameworks, UI component libraries, development tools, tutorials, conferences, and commercial implementations. The collection spans frontend web development technologies including server-side rendering frameworks (Nuxt.js), static site generators, mobile development solutions, state management libraries (Vuex, Pinia), testing tools, and enterprise applications. It addresses the fragmentation problem in the Vue.js ecosystem by providing developers, technical leads, and engineering teams with organized access to vetted libraries, learning resources, and real-world usage examples across categories like responsive design, animation, routing, and developer tooling for modern JavaScript web application development.
