Rueidis is a high-performance Redis client library for Go developers building distributed systems and web applications that require fast data access and caching. It implements advanced Redis protocol features including RESP3, automatic command pipelining, and server-assisted client-side caching to optimize throughput and reduce latency. The library provides type-safe command builders using Go generics, supports Redis Cluster/Sentinel deployments, and integrates with Redis modules like RedisJSON, RedisBloom, and RediSearch. Key features include automatic request batching, in-memory cache invalidation, distributed locking primitives, and OpenTelemetry observability. Target users are backend developers and system architects working on high-throughput applications, microservices, and distributed systems where Redis performance optimization and client-side caching are critical for scalability and response times.
