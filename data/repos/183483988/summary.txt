Ruffle is a Flash Player emulator, reimplemented in Rust, targeting both desktop and web platforms using WebAssembly. It allows users to run SWF (Shockwave Flash) files, addressing the obsolescence of Adobe Flash. Key functionalities include an ActionScript parser, desktop and web clients, and utilities for scanning and exporting SWF content. The project is structured with core emulator components, rendering backends, and video decoding capabilities, making it a standalone application designed to facilitate Flash content playback and preservation.
