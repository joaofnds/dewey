Ruffle is a cross-platform Adobe Flash Player emulator implemented in Rust that enables execution of SWF (Shockwave Flash) files without the deprecated Adobe Flash Player. The project targets web preservation and legacy Flash content accessibility by supporting ActionScript 1, 2, and 3 execution environments. It compiles to WebAssembly for browser integration and provides native desktop applications across platforms. The emulator handles Flash's complex runtime including vector graphics rendering, audio playback, and interactive scripting through a complete reimplementation of the Flash Player architecture. Ruffle serves web developers, digital archivists, and content creators who need to maintain access to legacy Flash applications, games, and interactive media in modern computing environments where Adobe Flash Player is no longer supported or secure.
