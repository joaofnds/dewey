Pamparam is an Emacs Lisp implementation of spaced repetition flashcard system designed for knowledge retention and memorization within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. Built for Emacs users and developers, it implements spaced repetition algorithms that schedule card reviews based on performance scores, storing card metadata, learning progress, and scheduling data in Git-tracked repositories using Org-mode file formats. The system manages master files containing card definitions, individual card files with metadata and ease factors, daily schedule files, and pile files for unscheduled cards, all organized in a structured directory hierarchy with MD5-hashed filenames. It targets programmers, researchers, and knowledge workers who prefer terminal-based workflows and want to integrate memorization tasks directly into their Emacs-centric development environment without switching to external flashcard applications.
