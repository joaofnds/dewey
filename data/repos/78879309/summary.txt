`cljstyle` is a Clojure code formatting tool that automatically standardizes code style and indentation across Clojure/ClojureScript projects. Built for Clojure developers and development teams, it addresses the need for consistent code formatting by providing automated style checking and fixing capabilities similar to tools like Prettier or gofmt. The tool is implemented in Clojure and distributed as native binaries via GraalVM compilation, offering commands for checking, fixing, and piping code through formatters. It integrates with common development workflows through Leiningen, tools.deps, editors, and CI/CD pipelines, supporting hierarchical configuration via `.cljstyle` files. This tool specifically serves the Clojure ecosystem's software development domain, replacing and extending the original cljfmt tool with enhanced configurability and performance.
