Eldev is an Emacs Lisp-specific build tool and development environment designed for Elisp package development and maintenance. Built entirely in Emacs Lisp, it serves as an alternative to Cask by providing programmatic configuration through Elisp code rather than declarative project descriptions. The tool automates dependency management from package archives (MELPA, GNU ELPA), Git repositories, and local sources, while offering integrated unit testing, linting, profiling, and continuous integration support. It features project isolation, multi-Emacs version testing with Docker/Podman support, autoload generation, and release automation capabilities. Eldev targets Emacs Lisp developers and package maintainers who need a comprehensive build system for developing, testing, and distributing Elisp packages across different Emacs versions and operating systems.
