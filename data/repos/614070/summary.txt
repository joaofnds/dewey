RubyGems is a comprehensive package management framework for the Ruby programming language ecosystem, serving as both a command-line tool and client library for distributing, installing, and managing Ruby libraries called "gems." The system provides core functionality for dependency resolution, version management, and integration with the centralized RubyGems.org repository, enabling developers to publish and consume reusable code packages. Built entirely in Ruby with rdoc-based documentation, it addresses the fundamental software distribution problem in Ruby development by standardizing package formats, automating installation processes, and managing library dependencies across Ruby applications. The framework targets Ruby developers, library authors, and system administrators who need reliable dependency management and code distribution mechanisms for Ruby-based projects and applications.
