RubyGems is a Ruby-based package manager and distribution system. It provides the `gem` command-line tool for installing, managing, and creating Ruby libraries (gems). Users can download and install gems from repositories like RubyGems.org, which serves as a public package repository.  The project supports Ruby 3.0 or later and enables developers to package and share reusable Ruby code. This is a core library and command-line tool for Ruby developers, central to dependency management and code reuse in the Ruby ecosystem.
