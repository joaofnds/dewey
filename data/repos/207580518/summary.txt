`inertiajs/inertia-rails` is a Ruby on Rails adapter facilitating the integration of Inertia.js, enabling the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) with server-side rendering capabilities within a Rails environment. This library provides renderers for generating Inertia responses, managing component props, shared data across components, and supports features such as deep merging of shared data and optional prop loading for performance optimization. Key features include routing helpers, configuration options for asset versioning and server-side rendering (SSR), and comprehensive RSpec test helpers for assertion testing. This project is a Ruby library for backend developers aiming to build modern web applications with Rails and Inertia.js.
