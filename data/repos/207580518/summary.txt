The inertia-rails gem is a Ruby on Rails server-side adapter for Inertia.js, a web development framework that enables building single-page applications using traditional server-side routing and controllers. It allows Rails developers to create modern SPAs without complex API development by rendering JavaScript components (React, Vue.js) directly from Rails controllers while maintaining server-side routing, authentication, and validation. The adapter provides Rails-specific functionality including controller rendering methods, shared data management, automatic prop binding, layout configuration, and integration with Rails conventions. It targets full-stack web developers building interactive web applications who want to leverage Rails' backend capabilities with modern frontend frameworks without the complexity of separate API and client architectures.
