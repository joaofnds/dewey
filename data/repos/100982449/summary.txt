Argo Workflows is a Go-based, cloud-native workflow engine for orchestrating containerized parallel jobs on Kubernetes, targeting data processing, machine learning pipelines, and CI/CD workflows. It allows users to define workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) or sequences of containerized steps, enabling the execution of compute-intensive tasks. Key features include UI-based workflow management, artifact support, templating, scheduling, and comprehensive features for workflow control such as retries, timeouts, and resource orchestration. This standalone application facilitates automation and orchestration of complex Kubernetes-based workflows.
