Argo Workflows is a Kubernetes-native workflow orchestration engine implemented as a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for executing containerized jobs in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Built in Go, it targets DevOps engineers, data scientists, and MLOps practitioners for automating complex multi-step processes including machine learning pipelines, batch data processing, CI/CD automation, and infrastructure provisioning. The engine leverages Kubernetes' container orchestration capabilities to execute workflow steps as pods, supporting artifact management across multiple storage backends (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) and providing both CLI and web UI interfaces. As a CNCF graduated project, it serves as a cloud-native alternative to traditional workflow engines like Airflow, specifically designed for containerized environments without legacy VM overhead.
