Lume is a comprehensive utility library for Lua providing essential mathematical, data manipulation, and functional programming functions specifically designed for game development. The library offers core gamedev utilities including vector math (distance, angle, interpolation), randomization functions (weighted choice, random selection), array/table operations (map, filter, reduce), and common mathematical functions (clamp, lerp, smooth). It serves as a foundational toolkit for Lua-based game developers working with frameworks like LÃ–VE or custom engines, addressing the lack of built-in utility functions in base Lua. The single-file library targets game programmers who need reliable, optimized implementations of frequently-used operations for 2D/3D mathematics, collection processing, and procedural generation without external dependencies.
