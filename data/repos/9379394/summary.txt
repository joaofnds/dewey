This repository provides a comprehensive example implementation of Datomic database queries using the MusicBrainz music metadata dataset, specifically covering the 1968-1973 period. Built in Clojure, it demonstrates Datomic's immutable, time-based database capabilities through practical music domain queries involving artists, albums, tracks, and their relationships. The project includes pre-configured database backups, Datalog query rules, schema definitions, and step-by-step instructions for setting up a local Datomic transactor. It serves as a learning resource and evaluation tool for database developers and Clojure programmers interested in exploring Datomic's ACID transaction model, elastic scalability, and temporal query capabilities within a real-world music metadata context, making complex relational data operations accessible through functional programming paradigms.
