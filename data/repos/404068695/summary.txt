Porth is a stack-based concatenative programming language implementation inspired by Forth, written in Python. It targets systems programming and low-level development domains, providing a minimalist approach to compiled language design. The project serves as an educational tool and experimental compiler for developers interested in language implementation, stack-based programming paradigms, and understanding compilation techniques. Porth compiles to native assembly code while maintaining Forth's characteristic postfix notation and stack manipulation operations. The language is primarily aimed at programming language enthusiasts, compiler developers, and systems programmers who want to explore alternative programming paradigms or learn about language construction through a simplified yet functional implementation of concatenative programming concepts.
