nvim-lsp-notify is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides real-time visual notifications for Language Server Protocol (LSP) processes and operations. Targeting software developers using Neovim as their primary editor, it addresses the common issue of LSP process visibility by displaying progress indicators and status updates for language server activities like code analysis, formatting, and diagnostics. The plugin integrates with Neovim's built-in LSP client and optionally leverages nvim-notify for enhanced notification UI, featuring customizable spinner animations and completion icons. It serves developers across various programming languages (Rust, Lua, JavaScript, etc.) who rely on LSP-powered features for code intelligence and want transparent feedback about background language server operations within their development workflow.
