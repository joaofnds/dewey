This repository provides manually curated color themes for ConEmu, a Windows terminal emulator popular among developers and system administrators. The project addresses the problem of poor visual consistency in automatically ported terminal color schemes by manually adapting popular themes from editors like Atom, Sublime Text, Emacs, and Vim to work optimally with ConEmu's color palette system. It includes PowerShell automation scripts for theme installation and XML configuration management, targeting Windows developers who use ConEmu for command-line work, PowerShell scripting, and development workflows. The repository contains over 20 professionally adapted themes including Material, Dracula, Solarized, Nord, and Gruvbox variants, with detailed installation documentation and visual previews, serving the Windows development and DevOps community seeking improved terminal aesthetics and readability.
