rest.nvim is a Neovim plugin that provides an integrated HTTP client for API development and testing workflows. Built in Lua with tree-sitter parsing for HTTP files, it enables developers to execute REST API requests directly within their editor environment without switching to external tools like Postman or Insomnia. The plugin leverages curl as its underlying HTTP engine, supports dynamic variables and Lua scripting within HTTP files, and provides asynchronous request execution with detailed response formatting and statistics. It targets web developers, backend engineers, and API developers who prefer terminal-based workflows and want to perform API testing, debugging, and documentation within their Neovim editing environment. The plugin includes features like environment variable management, cookie handling, custom hooks, and tree-sitter-based syntax highlighting for HTTP request files.
