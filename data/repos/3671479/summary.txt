Nmap is a standalone, command-line application for network discovery and security auditing. Its core functionality centers around port scanning, service detection, and OS fingerprinting, utilizing techniques like TCP/UDP packet analysis and asynchronous network I/O. Implemented primarily in C, it leverages libraries such as libpcap for packet capture, and integrates support for Lua scripting. This project targets system administrators, security professionals, and network engineers requiring detailed network mapping and vulnerability assessment capabilities across various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
