Nmap is a comprehensive network discovery and security auditing tool written in C/C++ that performs port scanning, host discovery, and service enumeration across networks. Targeting cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and penetration testers, it leverages libpcap for packet capture, Lua scripting for extensible functionality, and PCRE for pattern matching to identify open ports, running services, and network topology. The tool operates asynchronously across multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS) using raw sockets and various scanning techniques including TCP SYN, UDP, and ping sweeps. Nmap addresses critical network security assessment needs by providing detailed reconnaissance capabilities for vulnerability assessment, network inventory management, and security compliance auditing, making it an essential component in enterprise security toolkits and ethical hacking workflows.
