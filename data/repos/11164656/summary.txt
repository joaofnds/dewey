`cl-glfw3` provides Common Lisp bindings for the GLFW 3.x library, enabling the creation of graphical applications. This library offers direct access to GLFW functions, along with convenience enhancements detailed in its source code. Users can leverage these bindings to create windows, handle input, and manage OpenGL contexts, with example applications showcasing basic windowing, event handling, and particle effects available. It functions as a library and is installable via Quicklisp, depending on GLFW and libffi; example applications also depend on cl-opengl.
