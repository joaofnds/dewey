cl-glfw3 provides Common Lisp bindings for GLFW 3.x, a cross-platform library for creating OpenGL contexts and managing windows, input, and events. Targeting game developers and graphics programmers working in the Common Lisp ecosystem, this library enables development of OpenGL-based applications, games, and real-time graphics software. The bindings include both direct low-level GLFW function access and enhanced convenience wrappers, requiring GLFW 3.x and libffi as system dependencies. It integrates with cl-opengl for complete OpenGL development workflows and includes practical examples demonstrating window creation, event handling, particle systems, and shader programming. The library serves Common Lisp developers who need native windowing and input management capabilities for graphics programming, game development, and interactive multimedia applications.
