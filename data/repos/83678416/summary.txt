`usql` is a universal command-line database client written in Go that provides a unified interface for connecting to and querying multiple database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and various NoSQL databases. Designed for database administrators, developers, and DevOps professionals, it serves as a `psql`-compatible alternative that eliminates the need for database-specific CLI tools by supporting over 30 different database drivers through Go's standard SQL interface and `github.com/xo/dburl`. The tool addresses the complexity of managing multiple database environments by offering features like cross-database copying, syntax highlighting, context-based completion, variables, and backslash commands in a single executable, making it particularly valuable for polyglot database environments and database migration workflows.
