`usql` is a universal command-line interface for various SQL databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle Database, SQLite3, Microsoft SQL Server, and numerous other databases. It provides a simple way to work with SQL and NoSQL databases via a command-line inspired by PostgreSQL's `psql`. The tool supports most core `psql` features such as variables, backticks, backslash commands, and has additional features like multiple database support, copying between databases, syntax highlighting, context-based completion, and terminal graphics.

This Go-based project offers a unified experience for database administrators and developers who prefer working with a tool similar to `psql` but for non-PostgreSQL databases. It simplifies the process of interacting with various SQL databases, making it intuitive, easy-to-use, and an excellent replacement for command-line clients/tools for other databases.

Key features include:
1. Support for multiple databases, including both relational and non-relational databases.
2. Compatibility with core `psql` features such as variables, backticks, and backslash commands.
3. Additional features like copying between databases, syntax highlighting, context-based completion, and terminal graphics.
4. Integration with Go for efficient performance and scalability.

Target users include database administrators, developers, and data scientists who work with various SQL databases and prefer a command-line interface for interacting with their databases.
