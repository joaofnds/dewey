sxhkd is a lightweight X11 hotkey daemon written in C that enables system administrators and Linux desktop users to bind keyboard shortcuts to shell commands and system operations. Targeting the Linux desktop environment domain, it processes X server input events and executes corresponding commands based on user-defined configuration bindings. The tool supports advanced mapping syntax for parallel shortcut-to-command associations, including modifier key combinations (super, alt, ctrl), function keys, and multimedia keys. It integrates with window managers like bspwm for desktop navigation, media players through mpc commands, and system utilities for power management and window manipulation. The daemon serves as a critical component in minimal window manager setups and custom Linux desktop environments where users need programmable keyboard control.
