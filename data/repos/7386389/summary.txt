`sxhkd` is a standalone C application serving as a simple X hotkey daemon, enabling users to execute commands based on input events. Its core functionality revolves around a configuration file defining keybindings that map input events (key combinations and button presses) to shell commands. Features include support for parallel execution of commands triggered by multiple shortcuts, as demonstrated by comprehensive example bindings in the README. This project acts as a developer productivity tool, likely targeted at users of window managers and other X-based graphical environments seeking to customize their system behavior with keyboard shortcuts.
