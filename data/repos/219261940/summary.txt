This repository implements a VS Code extension that integrates Grammarly's grammar checking capabilities into the Visual Studio Code editor through a custom Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation. Built with TypeScript, it leverages tree-sitter parsers for multi-language syntax analysis and Grammarly's SDK for grammar validation across various programming languages and markup formats including HTML. The extension uses a richtext encoder to transform code content for grammar analysis while preserving language-specific syntax structures. Targeted at software developers and technical writers, it addresses the need for automated grammar checking within development environments, particularly for documentation, comments, and content-focused files. The architecture supports extensibility through modular language transformers and WebAssembly-compiled tree-sitter grammars, enabling grammar checking across diverse programming languages and file formats within the VS Code ecosystem.
