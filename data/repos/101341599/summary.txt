This repository is an educational resource that demonstrates lambda calculus, combinatory logic, and Church encodings through JavaScript implementations. It serves as a learning tool for computer science students and functional programming enthusiasts to understand fundamental concepts in computation theory and functional programming paradigms. The codebase implements combinators, currying, function composition, and mathematical abstractions using pure JavaScript functions, providing runnable examples that translate abstract mathematical concepts into executable code. Created as supplementary material for computer science education, it includes presentation slides, video lectures, and interactive REPL demonstrations. The target audience consists of developers, computer science students, and educators seeking to bridge the gap between theoretical computation concepts and practical functional programming techniques in JavaScript environments.
