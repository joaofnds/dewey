PGlite is a WebAssembly (WASM) compilation of PostgreSQL packaged as a TypeScript client library that enables developers to run a full Postgres database directly in browsers, Node.js, Bun, and Deno environments without external dependencies. Built for web development and local-first applications, it leverages Postgres's single-user mode compiled through Emscripten to create a 3MB embeddable database with support for extensions like pgvector. The library addresses the need for client-side SQL databases with full PostgreSQL compatibility, offering both ephemeral in-memory usage and persistent storage via IndexedDB (browser) or filesystem (server-side). Target users are JavaScript/TypeScript developers building reactive, real-time applications who need PostgreSQL's advanced features without server infrastructure complexity.
