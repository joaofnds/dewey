PGlite is a TypeScript client library providing an embeddable, in-browser or server-side (Node.js, Bun, Deno) PostgreSQL database. Built on WebAssembly (WASM), it enables local-first, real-time, and reactive database capabilities directly within JavaScript environments, reducing dependencies and offering support for PostgreSQL extensions like pgvector. The library facilitates in-memory or persistent database storage using IndexedDB (browser) or the filesystem (Node/Bun/Deno). This library is designed to allow developers to build web applications leveraging the Postgres database inside the browser and server, without complex database infrastructure.
