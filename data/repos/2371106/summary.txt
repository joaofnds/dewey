The Ruby Style Guide is a community-driven documentation project that establishes standardized coding conventions and best practices for Ruby programming language development. Targeting Ruby developers across web development, backend systems, and general software engineering domains, it provides comprehensive guidelines for code formatting, syntax usage, naming conventions, and structural patterns to ensure code readability and maintainability. The guide serves as the foundational specification for RuboCop, a static code analyzer and linter tool, enabling automated enforcement of style rules in Ruby codebases. Written in AsciiDoc format, it addresses the Ruby ecosystem's historical lack of unified coding standards by consolidating industry best practices from experienced developers and authoritative Ruby programming resources, making it essential for Ruby developers, teams, and organizations seeking consistent, professional code quality standards.
