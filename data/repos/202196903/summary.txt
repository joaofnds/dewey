`grip-mode` is an Emacs Lisp package providing instant preview functionality for GitHub-flavored Markdown and Org files. It leverages external tools like Grip, mdopen, or go-grip to render Markdown/Org content within Emacs, optionally using an embedded webkit browser for display, or the user's default browser. Key features include customizable keybindings, theming options, and support for alternative preview engines to avoid GitHub API rate limits. This is a developer productivity tool, specifically a plugin/extension for the Emacs text editor, targeting Emacs users who work with Markdown and Org files.
