f.el is an Emacs Lisp library that provides a modern, comprehensive API for file system operations within the Emacs text editor ecosystem. Targeting Emacs Lisp developers and power users who write custom configurations or packages, it offers over 50 functions organized into categories including path manipulation (join, split, expand), file I/O operations (read/write text and binary data), destructive operations (mkdir, delete, copy, move), file system predicates (exists, readable, writable), and file statistics (size, timestamps). The library solves the problem of Emacs' inconsistent and verbose built-in file handling functions by providing a clean, predictable interface inspired by popular Emacs utilities like s.el and dash.el, enabling more maintainable and readable file system code in Emacs configurations and extensions.
