Sketch is a Common Lisp framework for creating interactive visual applications, electronic art, and games using 2D graphics programming. Built on SDL2 as its primary backend with OpenGL 3.3 support, it provides a Processing-like API for computer graphics development, visual design prototyping, and human-computer interaction exploration. The framework handles window management, input processing, image loading (SDL2_Image), font rendering (SDL2_TTF), and graphics operations through a declarative programming model. It targets creative coders, game developers, digital artists, and researchers working in computational art or interactive media who prefer functional programming approaches. Sketch abstracts low-level graphics programming complexities while maintaining the expressiveness of Common Lisp for rapid prototyping of visual applications, games, and interactive installations across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
