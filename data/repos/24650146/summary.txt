Open Location Code is a Java library providing an encoding system, termed "Plus Codes," designed to generate short, shareable digital addresses suitable for areas lacking standard street addresses. The library allows encoding and decoding of locations (latitude and longitude) into and from these Plus Codes, supporting full and shortened code formats, as well as functionalities for code shortening relative to a reference location. Its core features include validation, encoding to standard and arbitrary lengths, decoding to coordinates, and code shortening/extension. Primarily, it functions as a library intended for integration into applications requiring location encoding and decoding capabilities, potentially targeting developers building mapping or location-based services across various languages, with implementations available in C, C++, Dart, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Rust.
