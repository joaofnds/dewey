Open Location Code is a Google-developed geospatial library that generates "plus codes" - short alphanumeric identifiers that encode latitude/longitude coordinates into human-readable addresses. Targeting the geospatial and mapping domain, it provides encoding/decoding algorithms to convert GPS coordinates into 10-20 character codes using a base-20 digit system, with precision ranging from 1-degree areas down to 3.5x2.8 meter grids. The library supports code shortening relative to reference locations and implements offline conversion without requiring geocoding services or lookup tables. Available across multiple programming languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, Go, Rust, etc.), it addresses the problem of digital addressing in areas lacking traditional street addresses, primarily serving developers building location-based applications, mapping services, and geographic information systems.
