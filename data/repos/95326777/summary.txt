RDF.ex is a comprehensive implementation of the RDF (Resource Description Framework) data model for Elixir, targeting semantic web and knowledge graph developers. The library provides fully compliant RDF 1.1 specification support with RDF-star extensions, offering in-memory data structures for RDF descriptions, graphs, and datasets. It features built-in serialization formats (N-Triples, N-Quads, Turtle, TriG), SPARQL query execution capabilities, XML Schema datatypes for literals, and RDF vocabulary modules with compile-time IRI validation. The framework includes a Turtle-like DSL for building RDF structures, graph pattern matching with streaming support, and integrates with complementary packages for JSON-LD, RDF-XML, and ShEx validation. This toolkit enables Elixir developers to build linked data applications, semantic web services, and knowledge management systems by providing native RDF processing capabilities within the Elixir ecosystem.
