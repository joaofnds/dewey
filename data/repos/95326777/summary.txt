`RDF.ex` is an Elixir library implementing the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model, providing tools for working with linked data. It offers in-memory data structures, including graphs and datasets, and supports RDF 1.1 and RDF-star specifications. Key functionalities include graph pattern matching, SPARQL query execution, serialization in various formats (N-Triples, Turtle, TriG), and integration with other Elixir packages for JSON-LD, RDF-XML, ShEx validation, and mapping to Elixir structs. This project is a library designed for Elixir developers working with semantic web technologies and knowledge graphs.
