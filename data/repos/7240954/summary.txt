This repository provides pre-patched monospace fonts specifically designed for the Powerline statusline plugin used in terminal environments and code editors. It targets developers, system administrators, and terminal power users who need enhanced visual status bars in their command-line interfaces. The collection includes 30+ patched font families (DejaVu Sans Mono, Source Code Pro, Fira Mono, etc.) modified to display special Unicode glyphs and symbols required by Powerline's enhanced status line features. Installation is handled through shell scripts that copy font files to system font directories on Linux, macOS, and Windows. The fonts solve the problem of missing or broken special characters in Powerline status bars, ensuring proper rendering of separators, branch symbols, and other visual indicators used in modern terminal multiplexers like tmux and shell prompts in development environments.
