Hystrix is a Java library designed for building resilient distributed systems by providing latency and fault tolerance. It isolates points of access to remote systems, services, and third-party libraries using features like circuit breakers, thread and semaphore isolation, and fallbacks to prevent cascading failures. Functionality includes real-time monitoring, dynamic configuration changes, and concurrency-aware caching. This library is intended to be used as a dependency in Java-based backend applications seeking to improve system stability and responsiveness in the face of failures within a microservices architecture.
