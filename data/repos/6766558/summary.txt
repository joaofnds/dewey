Netflix Hystrix is a Java-based fault tolerance and latency management library designed for distributed systems and microservices architectures. It implements the Circuit Breaker pattern to isolate access points to remote systems, services, and third-party APIs, preventing cascading failures in complex distributed environments. The library provides thread and semaphore isolation, automatic failover mechanisms, real-time monitoring, request caching, and batch processing capabilities. Developers wrap remote service calls in HystrixCommand objects to enable fault tolerance, graceful degradation, and rapid recovery. Targeted at backend Java developers and DevOps engineers building resilient microservices, Hystrix integrates with reactive programming patterns using RxJava Observables and supports synchronous, asynchronous, and reactive execution models for managing service dependencies in high-scale distributed systems.
