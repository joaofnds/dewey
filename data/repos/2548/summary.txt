The composite_primary_keys gem extends Ruby on Rails' ActiveRecord ORM to support composite primary keys, addressing ActiveRecord's infamous limitation of only supporting single-column primary keys. Designed for web developers working with Rails applications, it enables defining models with multi-column primary keys using `self.primary_keys = :column1, :column2` syntax and supports all Rails association types with composite foreign keys. The gem maintains compatibility across ActiveRecord versions 3.1 through 7.0, with version-specific releases, and supports major databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQLite, and SQL Server. It solves legacy database integration challenges and complex many-to-many relationship modeling where composite keys are essential for maintaining data integrity and existing database schemas.
