RedisJSON is a Rust-based module extending Redis, implementing the JSON data interchange standard as a native data type. It allows storing, updating, and fetching JSON documents within Redis, leveraging JSONPath syntax for element selection. Key features include binary storage for efficient sub-element access, typed atomic operations, and secondary index support when integrated with RediSearch. This project functions as a module/extension to Redis, enabling enhanced JSON document management for users of the Redis NoSQL database.
