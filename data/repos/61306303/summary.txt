RedisJSON is a Redis module written in Rust that implements the ECMA-404 JSON standard as a native Redis data type, enabling efficient storage and manipulation of JSON documents within Redis databases. It provides JSONPath syntax for querying nested document elements, binary tree storage for fast sub-element access, and atomic operations on JSON values. The module targets backend developers and database administrators building document-oriented applications, caching layers, and real-time data systems. It integrates with RediSearch for secondary indexing and is now included natively in Redis 8, solving the problem of efficiently storing and querying semi-structured JSON data in high-performance NoSQL environments without requiring external document databases.
