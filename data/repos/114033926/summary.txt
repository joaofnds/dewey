This repository contains Dockerfiles used to build CircleCI's convenience Docker images, published on Docker Hub. It provides the configuration files necessary for generating pre-built container images that streamline CircleCI workflows by pre-installing common tools and dependencies. The project tracks and automates the building of these images, with the `master` branch mirroring the official images and other branches tied to staging and testing environments. This project is a set of Dockerfile templates aimed at enabling developer productivity within the CircleCI continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform.
