Kaminari is a Ruby pagination library designed for modern web applications, providing scope-based and engine-driven pagination functionality across multiple ORMs and frameworks. Built primarily for Rails developers, it supports ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Mongoid, and MongoMapper ORMs, along with web frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, and Grape, and template engines including ERB, Haml, and Slim. The library implements method-chainable pagination through `.page()` and `.per()` scopes that integrate seamlessly with ActiveRecord relations, allowing developers to paginate database queries without polluting global namespaces or requiring special collection classes. It generates HTML5-compliant navigation elements with I18n support and customizable view templates, solving the common web development problem of efficiently displaying large datasets across multiple pages while maintaining clean, Rails-idiomatic code patterns for Ruby web developers.
