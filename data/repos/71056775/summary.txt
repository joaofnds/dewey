Kitty is a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator built primarily in Python with C and Go components, leveraging OpenGL for high-performance text rendering and graphics acceleration. It targets developers, system administrators, and power users who require a fast, cross-platform terminal with advanced features beyond traditional VT100 compatibility. The application addresses performance bottlenecks in conventional CPU-based terminal emulators by offloading rendering to the GPU, enabling smooth scrolling, ligature support, and efficient handling of large text outputs. Built with terminfo database integration and modern terminal protocol support, kitty serves the DevOps, software development, and system administration domains where terminal-intensive workflows demand responsive, feature-rich interfaces with consistent behavior across Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like systems.
