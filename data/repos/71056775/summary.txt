`kitty` is a cross-platform, GPU-based terminal emulator designed for speed and rich features. Built primarily in Python, the application leverages OpenGL for hardware-accelerated rendering, offering significant performance improvements over traditional terminal emulators. Key functionalities include VT100 terminal emulation, support for terminfo, and is extensible via a plugin system (though not explicitly stated, the presence of "go" and "golang" in keywords implies potential for Go-based extensions or related tooling). This standalone application aims to provide a modern terminal experience for developers and power users.
