`kbd-audio` is a C++ command-line and GUI application collection focused on acoustic keyboard eavesdropping, analyzing audio captured from a microphone to infer typed text. The core functionality is implemented through tools like `keytap`, `keytap2`, and `keytap3`, which employ various techniques, including machine learning and statistical analysis of n-grams, to recover text without requiring training data. Key features include real-time key detection, GUI visualization, and online demos, with a dependency on SDL2 for audio capture and GUI functionality, and optional FFTW3 for Fourier transformations. This is a standalone application project primarily targeting security researchers and enthusiasts.
