kbd-audio is a C++ acoustic analysis toolkit designed for cybersecurity research and digital forensics, specifically focused on acoustic keyboard eavesdropping attacks. The repository implements multiple algorithms (keytap, keytap2, keytap3) that analyze microphone audio data to reconstruct typed text by identifying unique acoustic signatures of individual keystrokes. Built using SDL2 for audio capture and optional FFTW3 for frequency domain analysis, the toolkit includes both command-line tools and GUI applications for real-time audio processing, keystroke detection, and text recovery. The tools leverage statistical analysis of English language n-grams and frequency patterns to perform training-free text reconstruction. Targeted at security researchers, penetration testers, and cybersecurity professionals, it demonstrates acoustic side-channel vulnerabilities in mechanical keyboards and serves as a proof-of-concept for acoustic surveillance countermeasures development.
