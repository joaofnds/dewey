HEML is an open-source markup language and compilation framework built in JavaScript that transforms simplified HTML-like syntax into cross-client compatible responsive email templates. Targeting the email marketing and web development domain, it addresses the complex challenge of creating emails that render consistently across diverse email clients (Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, etc.) which have varying CSS support and rendering engines. The framework compiles HEML markup into standard HTML with inline CSS and table-based layouts optimized for email delivery, abstracting away the intricacies of email client compatibility issues. Primary users include front-end developers, email marketers, and web developers who need to create responsive email campaigns without manually handling the extensive HTML table structures and CSS inlining typically required for reliable email rendering across platforms.
