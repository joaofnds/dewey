`vmd-mode.el` is an Emacs Lisp minor mode providing fast, synchronized previews for GitHub-flavored Markdown files. It leverages the Node.js-based `vmd` command-line utility for rendering, updating the preview in real-time within an Emacs window without requiring file saves. Key features include mimicking GitHub's Markdown rendering and integration with `company-mode` for emoji completion. This is a plugin/extension tailored for Emacs users, specifically developers and writers working with Markdown documentation within the Emacs environment.
