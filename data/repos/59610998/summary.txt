**vmd-mode** is an Emacs Lisp minor mode that provides real-time GitHub-flavored Markdown preview functionality for Emacs users. Built for technical documentation and content creation workflows, it integrates with the Node.js-based `vmd` preview tool to deliver synchronized markdown rendering without requiring file saves. The package leverages Emacs' `after-change-functions` and Node.js `fsnotify` for high-performance file watching, enabling responsive preview of large markdown documents. Targeted at developers, technical writers, and documentation maintainers working within the Emacs ecosystem, it solves the workflow friction of markdown editing by providing instant visual feedback. The tool supports multiple simultaneous buffer previews and includes GitHub emoji completion integration with `company-mode`, making it particularly suitable for developers creating README files, technical documentation, and GitHub-hosted content.
