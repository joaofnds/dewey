LevelDB is a fast, ordered key-value storage library written in C++ designed for persistent data storage. It provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values, supporting fundamental operations like `Put`, `Get`, and `Delete`, along with atomic batch updates and iterators for data traversal. Key features include data compression via Snappy and Zstd, customizable comparison functions, and a virtual interface for operating system interaction. This library, intended for integration into applications needing efficient, ordered data persistence, offers a straightforward interface and focuses on performance, though it's limited to single-process access and lacks built-in client-server support; it is a C++ library.
