BFG Repo-Cleaner is a Git repository maintenance tool written in Scala that performs fast repository history rewriting to remove large files, sensitive data, and problematic blobs from Git repositories. It serves as a high-performance alternative to Git's native `git-filter-branch` command, offering 10-720x faster execution speeds for repository cleansing operations. The tool targets DevOps engineers, software developers, and system administrators who need to sanitize Git repositories by stripping oversized files, removing accidentally committed passwords, credentials, or private data from repository history. Built specifically for Git version control workflows, it processes bare Git repositories to permanently eliminate unwanted content while preserving repository structure and commit history integrity, making it essential for repository maintenance and security compliance in software development environments.
