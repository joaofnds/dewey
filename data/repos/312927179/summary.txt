This TypeScript-based GitHub Action automates YAML and JSON file updates within CI/CD pipelines, specifically targeting DevOps workflows and containerized application deployments. It programmatically modifies configuration files using JSONPath expressions, enabling dynamic value injection during continuous integration processes. The action integrates with Git workflows to commit changes, create branches, and generate pull requests automatically. Primary use cases include updating Helm chart values.yaml files after Docker image builds, managing Kubernetes deployment configurations, and synchronizing version numbers across infrastructure-as-code repositories. It addresses the DevOps challenge of maintaining configuration consistency across environments without manual intervention. The tool is designed for platform engineers, DevOps practitioners, and software developers managing containerized applications with Helm, Kubernetes, and Docker-based deployment pipelines.
