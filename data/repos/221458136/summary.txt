Effect is a comprehensive TypeScript functional programming framework providing a monadic effect system for building production-ready applications with robust error handling, concurrency, and dependency injection. The monorepo targets enterprise TypeScript/JavaScript developers building server-side applications, CLIs, and distributed systems across Node.js, Bun, and browser environments. Core functionality includes type-safe side effect management, schema validation, OpenTelemetry observability integration, SQL database abstractions for multiple providers (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, ClickHouse), RPC utilities, clustering for distributed computing, and platform-specific runtime adapters. The framework addresses complexity in asynchronous programming, error propagation, and resource management while maintaining functional programming principles and comprehensive type safety throughout the application stack.
