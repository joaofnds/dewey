`Effect-TS/effect` is a TypeScript framework designed for building production-ready applications, providing a functional effect system with a rich standard library. It offers core primitives for managing side effects, ensuring type safety, and supporting concurrency, while also incorporating features for CLI development, distributed computing, observability (OpenTelemetry integration), platform-specific utilities (browser, Node.js, Bun), schema validation, and AI/RPC integration. This monorepo includes numerous packages, including those for SQL database interactions (multiple implementations, including ClickHouse, Cloudflare D1, and SQLite), and a comprehensive set of functional programming type classes. It functions primarily as a library for TypeScript developers focused on building robust and scalable applications.
