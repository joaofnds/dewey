Comlink is a TypeScript library designed to simplify WebWorker interaction, enabling developers to treat WebWorkers more like local code by abstracting away the complexities of `postMessage`. It provides an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) implementation leveraging ES6 Proxies for seamless communication between the main thread and worker threads. Key functionalities include `Comlink.wrap()` for creating proxies to worker objects, `Comlink.expose()` for exposing values, and support for transferring data, callbacks, and event listeners, including the use of custom transfer handlers. This developer-focused library, targeting frontend developers, facilitates cleaner, more maintainable code when utilizing WebWorkers, enhancing web application performance and responsiveness by offloading UI-intensive tasks to separate threads.
