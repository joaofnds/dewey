Comlink is a TypeScript-based RPC (Remote Procedure Call) library for web development that abstracts WebWorker communication complexity by eliminating manual postMessage handling. Built on ES6 Proxies, this 1.1kB library enables seamless function calls and object interactions between main browser threads and WebWorkers/SharedWorkers, treating remote worker objects as local JavaScript values. It supports modern browsers (Chrome 56+, Firefox 52+, Safari 10.1+) and addresses performance optimization challenges in web applications by facilitating easy offloading of computational tasks to background threads. The library targets frontend developers building performance-critical web applications who need to maintain responsive UIs while executing heavy JavaScript operations, particularly on mobile devices where main thread blocking significantly impacts user experience.
