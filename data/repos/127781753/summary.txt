Level is a team communication platform built as a full-stack SaaS application designed to optimize collaborative workflows for deep work by reducing the interruptions caused by real-time messaging tools. The system implements a modern web architecture with an Elixir/Phoenix backend providing GraphQL APIs, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and a single-page application frontend built in Elm for type-safe functional UI development. The platform targets software development teams and knowledge workers who need asynchronous communication tools that minimize context switching and notification fatigue. Key technical features include web push notifications, file uploads via AWS S3, transactional email integration through Postmark, and real-time updates through Phoenix channels, making it suitable for distributed teams requiring structured, less disruptive communication workflows than traditional chat applications.
