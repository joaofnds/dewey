**fiber-htmx** is a Go library that enables server-side rendering of HTML5 and HTMX applications without traditional templating engines, targeting web developers building interactive web applications with Go backends. The library integrates with the Fiber web framework and HTMX for dynamic frontend interactions, allowing developers to write type-safe, declarative HTML components directly in Go code with full IDE support including auto-completion and refactoring. It includes built-in support for TailwindCSS styling, Heroicons, server-sent events (SSE), live reload functionality, and component composition patterns. The package solves the problem of maintaining separate template files and JavaScript frameworks by providing a unified Go-based approach to building modern web applications, offering fast rendering performance (10,000 nodes in <0.8ms) while maintaining the benefits of Go's type system and tooling ecosystem.
