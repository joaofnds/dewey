The `scala/scala` repository houses the compiler and standard library for the Scala 2 programming language, a multi-paradigm language designed for both functional and object-oriented programming, with a focus on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It provides core functionalities including language compilation, standard library implementations, and associated tools such as a REPL and documentation generation (Scaladoc). Built using Scala and sbt, this project is a comprehensive development artifact comprising the compiler, standard libraries, and test suites, targeted at Scala developers and those interested in contributing to the language's core implementation.
