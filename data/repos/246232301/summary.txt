This repository provides a TypeScript adapter that integrates Keycloak authentication and authorization services with NestJS applications. Built for web development teams, it wraps the keycloak-nodejs-connect library to enable declarative security through decorators like @Resource, @Scopes, and @Roles for protecting API endpoints. The module supports both Express and Fastify platforms, implements resource-based access control (RBAC) using Keycloak's Authorization Services, and provides guards (AuthGuard, ResourceGuard, RoleGuard) for JWT token validation and permission enforcement. It addresses the complexity of implementing enterprise-grade authentication and fine-grained authorization in Node.js microservices, offering features like multi-tenant configuration, conditional scopes, and both synchronous and asynchronous module registration patterns for backend developers building secure REST APIs.
