`nest-keycloak-connect` is a TypeScript library providing Keycloak integration for NestJS applications, enabling secure resource access control and authentication. It facilitates the use of Keycloak's authorization services within NestJS controllers by offering decorators for resource protection (`@Resource`), scope management (`@Scopes`), and role-based access control (`@Roles`). The library provides guards for authentication, resource access, and role validation, allowing developers to secure their NestJS APIs. This is a library intended for backend developers building applications that require Keycloak-based authentication and authorization.
