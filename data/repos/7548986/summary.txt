Laravel Framework is a comprehensive PHP web application framework that provides a structured foundation for building modern web applications and APIs. Targeting web developers and full-stack engineers, it implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and offers core components including an ORM (Eloquent), routing engine, dependency injection container, database migration system, queue management, and real-time event broadcasting. The framework abstracts common web development tasks such as authentication, session management, caching, and database operations, enabling rapid development of scalable web applications. Laravel serves enterprise and startup developers who need an opinionated, feature-rich PHP framework that emphasizes developer experience and follows modern PHP standards.
