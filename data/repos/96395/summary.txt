Faker is a Ruby gem for generating realistic fake data including names, addresses, phone numbers, and domain-specific content across hundreds of categories. Originally ported from Perl's Data::Faker library, it serves Ruby developers working on web applications, testing frameworks, and database seeding tasks. The library provides extensive generators covering diverse domains from basic personal information to specialized content like TV shows, programming languages, and markdown text. It supports unique value generation, deterministic randomization with custom seeds, and localization for multiple languages. Faker primarily addresses the development and testing workflow challenge of populating applications with realistic sample data instead of using placeholder text, enabling better screenshot creation, database testing, and development environment setup. The gem integrates seamlessly with Ruby testing frameworks and development tools.
