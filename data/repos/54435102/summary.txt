Redpanda Connect is a high-performance stream processing engine written in Go designed for data engineering and ETL operations. It enables real-time data pipeline construction through declarative YAML configuration, connecting diverse sources and sinks including Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ, Redis, AWS services, GCP Pub/Sub, and SQL databases. The platform provides message transformation, filtering, and enrichment capabilities using its built-in Bloblang mapping language, while guaranteeing at-least-once delivery semantics through an in-process transaction model. Target users include data engineers, DevOps teams, and system administrators building event-driven architectures, CQRS systems, and streaming data pipelines. It offers cloud-native deployment as static binaries or Docker containers, with comprehensive monitoring through Prometheus metrics, health checks, and OpenTelemetry tracing for production observability.
