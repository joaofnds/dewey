This repository implements a web-based portfolio website that replicates macOS's graphical user interface using modern web technologies. Built with React for component architecture, TypeScript for type safety, and UnoCSS for styling, the application creates an interactive desktop simulation featuring authentic macOS elements like windows, dock, and system applications. The project leverages Zustand for state management, Vite for build tooling, and integrates advanced features including Battery API integration for real device status and a Typora editor clone using Milkdown. Targeting web developers and UI/UX professionals, this portfolio solution demonstrates advanced frontend development skills while providing an innovative personal branding platform that showcases technical expertise through interactive macOS environment simulation.
