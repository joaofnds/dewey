`ipfs/kubo` is a Go implementation of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer, content-addressed, versioned filesystem. It functions as an IPFS node, providing features such as content addressing, UnixFS support, HTTP gateway functionality for content retrieval via `/ipfs` and `/ipns`, and an HTTP RPC API (`/api/v0`) for daemon control with a corresponding command-line interface. This standalone application, available as a CLI tool and with a WebUI, is a core component of the IPFS project, enabling users to store, retrieve, and share data in a decentralized manner.
