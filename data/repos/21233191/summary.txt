Kubo is the reference implementation of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol written in Go, serving as a distributed peer-to-peer filesystem for content-addressed storage and retrieval. It targets distributed systems developers, blockchain engineers, and infrastructure administrators building decentralized applications or content delivery networks. The implementation leverages libp2p for network communication, implements DHT-based routing, and provides HTTP Gateway functionality for web interoperability. Kubo operates as a network daemon offering UnixFS file system support, content addressing via cryptographic hashes, and both CLI and HTTP RPC APIs for programmatic access. It solves the problem of centralized content storage by enabling permanent, versioned, and globally distributed file sharing across a peer-to-peer network, making it essential for Web3 infrastructure and decentralized application backends.
