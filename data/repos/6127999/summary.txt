`luv` is a C-based library providing bindings for the `libuv` asynchronous I/O library, enabling its use within Lua and LuaJIT environments. This library facilitates asynchronous programming in Lua by exposing `libuv`'s event loop and related functionalities, allowing developers to build networked applications and handle I/O operations efficiently.  It supports Lua versions 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4, and offers features like timers and TCP server implementation, and provides examples of its usage.  `luv` is a library intended for integration within Lua projects, particularly those leveraging `libuv` for asynchronous operations, with build configurations available for multiple operating systems and Lua engine options.
