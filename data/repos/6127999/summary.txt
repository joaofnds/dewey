luv is a C-based library providing direct libuv bindings for Lua and LuaJIT, enabling asynchronous I/O and event-driven programming in Lua applications. Targeting backend developers and systems programmers, it bridges libuv's cross-platform networking, filesystem, and concurrency capabilities with Lua's scripting environment. The library supports multi-threading with isolated event loops per Lua state and provides comprehensive access to libuv's TCP/UDP sockets, timers, filesystem operations, and process management. Originally developed for the Luvit runtime, it solves the problem of building high-performance, non-blocking server applications and network services in Lua, competing with Node.js-style asynchronous programming models while leveraging Lua's lightweight syntax and LuaJIT's performance characteristics.
