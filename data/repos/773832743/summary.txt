**jnv** is an interactive JSON filtering and navigation tool built in Rust that provides a terminal-based interface for exploring and querying JSON data using jq syntax. Targeted at developers, DevOps engineers, and data analysts working with JSON APIs, configuration files, or log data, it combines a real-time JSON viewer with an integrated jq filter editor featuring syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and live query results. The tool leverages the jaq library (a Rust implementation of jq) to eliminate external dependencies, supports various input formats including JSON Lines and streaming data via stdin/files, and offers extensive customization through TOML configuration. It addresses the common need for quickly inspecting, filtering, and extracting data from complex JSON structures in command-line workflows, particularly useful for Kubernetes manifest analysis, API response debugging, and log file processing.
