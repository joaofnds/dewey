Tabby is a self-hosted AI coding assistant built in Rust that provides code completion and generation capabilities as an open-source alternative to GitHub Copilot. It serves software developers across all programming languages by running Large Language Models (LLMs) locally on consumer-grade GPUs, eliminating dependency on cloud services. The system features a self-contained architecture with no external database requirements, OpenAPI interfaces for IDE integration, and supports multiple deployment methods including Docker. Key components include an Answer Engine for internal documentation queries, repository indexing for contextual code understanding, and extensions for popular IDEs like VSCode. It targets development teams requiring on-premises AI assistance while maintaining code privacy and infrastructure control.
