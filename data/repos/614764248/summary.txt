Tabby is a self-hosted, open-source AI coding assistant written in Rust, designed to provide code completion and generation capabilities, functioning as an on-premises alternative to cloud-based tools like GitHub Copilot. It integrates with IDEs, offering an OpenAPI interface for seamless integration into existing developer workflows and infrastructure. Key features include support for consumer-grade GPUs, an "Answer Engine" for knowledge retrieval within engineering teams, and various extensions for popular IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains products, enhancing developer productivity. The project is a standalone application targeting developers, particularly those seeking AI-assisted coding tools within their existing development environments.
