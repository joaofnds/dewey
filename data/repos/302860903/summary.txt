Org-transclusion is an Emacs Lisp package that implements content transclusion functionality for Org Mode, enabling users to insert live references to text content from other files or sections via file links and ID links. Targeting academic researchers, technical writers, and knowledge workers in the Emacs ecosystem, it addresses the problem of content duplication and synchronization across multiple documents by maintaining dynamic links instead of static copies. The package supports transclusion from various file types including source code, Markdown, and other Org files, with network protocol support for HTTP and Hyperdrive through extension packages. It integrates with org-roam for enhanced note-taking workflows and provides live synchronization between source content and transcluded copies, making it particularly valuable for academic writing, technical documentation, and research literature management where content reuse and consistency are critical.
