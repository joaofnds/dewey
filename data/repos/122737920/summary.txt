`jplot` is a command-line interface (CLI) tool written in Go for real-time monitoring of JSON-formatted metrics within the iTerm2 terminal or DRCS Sixel Graphics-supported terminals. Its core functionality involves parsing JSON data, extracting specified values, and visualizing their evolution over time through dynamically generated graphs.  Users define the data to be graphed using a flexible syntax based on gojq JSON query language, with options for counter-based differencing and marker visualizations. This standalone application targets developers and system administrators interested in visualizing application performance metrics, with integrations demonstrated for Go's expvar and performance testing tools like Vegeta.
