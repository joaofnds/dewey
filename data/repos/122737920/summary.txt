jplot is a Go-based command-line monitoring tool designed for DevOps and backend developers to visualize JSON metrics in real-time directly within iTerm2 terminals or DRCS Sixel Graphics-compatible terminals. It specializes in tracking Go application expvar endpoints and other JSON-based metrics APIs, rendering time-series graphs with support for stacked visualizations, counter differentials, and marker annotations. The tool uses gojq JSON query syntax for metric selection and integrates with Go's built-in expvar package for monitoring memory statistics, garbage collection metrics, and custom application counters. Primary use cases include monitoring Go service performance, visualizing memstats data, and creating real-time dashboards for load testing with tools like Vegeta, targeting system administrators and Go developers who need immediate visual feedback on application metrics without external monitoring infrastructure.
