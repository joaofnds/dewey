`uutils/coreutils` is a cross-platform reimplementation of the GNU coreutils, written in Rust, providing command-line utilities for various operating systems. It aims to be a drop-in replacement for GNU coreutils, offering a wide range of functionalities including file manipulation, text processing, and system administration tools. The project supports installation via Cargo and GNU Make, building both multicall and individual utility binaries. This is a standalone command-line application project, targeting system administrators and developers who require a portable and potentially more performant suite of core utilities.
