This Emacs Lisp package implements a text transformation function that converts strings to alternating case patterns, commonly known as "SpongeBob mocking text" or "sarcasm case" (e.g., "YoU cAn'T wRiTe"). The package targets Emacs users and developers working within the GNU Emacs text editor ecosystem, providing a utility function for text manipulation and formatting. Built using Emacs Lisp, it integrates with Emacs' buffer system and text processing capabilities to offer region-based or buffer-wide case conversion. The primary use case addresses content creators, social media managers, and developers who need to generate alternating case text for memes, sarcastic comments, or stylized content directly within their Emacs workflow, eliminating the need for external text transformation tools.
