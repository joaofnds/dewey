Dasel is a cross-platform command-line data manipulation tool written in Go that provides unified query, update, and deletion operations across multiple structured data formats including JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, and CSV. Designed for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers working with configuration files and data processing pipelines, it implements a standardized selector syntax similar to jq/yq but with broader format support and zero runtime dependencies. The tool addresses the complexity of working with heterogeneous data formats by offering seamless format conversion, consistent querying capabilities, and integration options including CLI usage, Go package imports, Docker containers, and pre-commit hooks. Performance benchmarks indicate significant speed improvements over existing tools like jq and yq for data transformation workflows.
