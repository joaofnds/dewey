`dasel` is a Go-based command-line tool and Go package designed for querying, modifying, and converting data within JSON, YAML, TOML, XML, and CSV files. It provides a unified selector syntax, comparable to `jq` and `yq`, enabling users to select, put, and delete data elements. Key features include format conversion, zero runtime dependencies, and integration as a pre-commit hook. This project is a standalone CLI application and library, targeting developers and DevOps engineers working with configuration files, data processing, and data wrangling tasks.
