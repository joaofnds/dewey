Futhark is a data-parallel, purely functional programming language designed for high-performance computing, particularly on GPUs and CPUs. The language compiles to efficient parallel code, enabling users to develop applications in the high-performance computing (HPC) domain. Key features include data-parallelism and support for GPU programming via backends like CUDA and OpenCL, offering efficient execution for computationally intensive tasks. This project is a programming language and compiler, targeting researchers and developers interested in accelerating numerical and scientific computations.
