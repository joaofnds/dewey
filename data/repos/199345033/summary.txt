`diabloweb` is a JavaScript project that ports Diablo 1 to web browsers using WebAssembly. It leverages and modifies code from `diasurgical/devilution`, removing dependencies and exposing a minimal JS interface to enable in-browser gameplay. The project facilitates playing the Diablo 1 shareware version directly through a web browser and supports the full game with a user-provided `DIABDAT.MPQ` file. This is a standalone web application, likely targeting gamers and potentially web developers interested in game porting or web-based gaming.
