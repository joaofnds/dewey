DiabloWeb is a WebAssembly port of the classic Diablo 1 game engine for web browsers, built upon the devilution reverse-engineering project. The repository implements a JavaScript-to-WebAssembly bridge that removes native dependencies and exposes a minimal API for browser compatibility, requiring significant modifications to event handling systems to accommodate web-based interaction models. Targeting retro gaming enthusiasts and web developers interested in game preservation, the project enables cross-platform gameplay including mobile devices by leveraging WebAssembly compilation and JavaScript event management. The implementation addresses the technical challenge of running legacy C++ game code in modern web environments while maintaining compatibility with original game assets (MPQ files), demonstrating practical application of WebAssembly for complex interactive applications beyond typical web development use cases.
