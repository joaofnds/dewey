FastHttpRouter is a high-performance HTTP request router (multiplexer) written in Go, specifically designed for the fasthttp framework as an alternative to the standard net/http package. Forked from the popular httprouter, it implements a compressed radix tree (trie) data structure to efficiently match URL paths with minimal memory allocation and zero garbage collection during request dispatching. The router targets web developers building high-throughput REST APIs and web services, offering features like path parameter extraction, automatic trailing slash handling, path auto-correction, and panic recovery. It's optimized for production environments processing millions of requests per day, providing exact route matching without ambiguous pattern conflicts, making it ideal for microservices architectures and performance-critical web applications where request routing speed and memory efficiency are paramount.
