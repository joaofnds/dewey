`fasthttprouter` is a high-performance Go library providing a request router (multiplexer) specifically designed for the `fasthttp` HTTP server library. It addresses the need for efficient URL routing within Go web applications, emphasizing speed and a small memory footprint for optimal scalability. Key features include a compressing dynamic radix tree for efficient matching, explicit route matching to prevent ambiguous path resolutions, automatic redirection for trailing slashes, path auto-correction, named and catch-all parameter support within routes, and a zero-garbage collection matching process. This library is primarily a backend component, intended for developers building web applications and APIs in Go using `fasthttp`.
