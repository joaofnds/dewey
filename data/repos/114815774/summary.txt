matcher-combinators is a Clojure testing library that provides composable matcher combinators for making assertions about nested data structures in unit tests. Targeted at Clojure developers working on applications with complex data models, it integrates with clojure.test and Midje testing frameworks to enable structural pattern matching and validation. The library solves the problem of asserting against deeply nested maps, vectors, sets, and sequences by offering matchers like `embeds`, `prefix`, `in-any-order`, and `set-equals` that can be combined to match partial structures, ignore ordering, or validate specific patterns. It generates pretty-printed diffs when assertions fail, making it particularly valuable for backend developers, API testing, and functional programming scenarios where data transformation verification is critical. The library extends beyond simple equality checks to support regex matching, predicate functions, and flexible structural validation.
