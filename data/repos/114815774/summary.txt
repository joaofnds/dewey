`matcher-combinators` is a Clojure library designed for creating composable matcher combinators to effectively assert and compare nested data structures during testing. The library provides a flexible and extensible way to define data structure matching rules, supporting features such as scalar and structural value matching, pretty-printed diffs, and integration with `clojure.test` and Midje testing frameworks. It offers built-in matchers for various Clojure data types, including equals, embeds, prefix, in-any-order, and regex, along with the `via` matcher for data transformation before matching. This library is a developer productivity tool, designed to streamline and enhance the testing of Clojure code, especially when dealing with complex, nested data structures.
