`rlwrap` is a command-line utility that wraps any Unix command with GNU Readline functionality, enabling keyboard input editing, command history, and tab completion for programs that lack these features. Built in C for maximum portability across Unix-like systems (Linux, FreeBSD, macOS, Solaris, AIX), it targets system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who work with legacy command-line tools, database clients, network utilities, or interactive interpreters that display raw terminal escape sequences instead of proper line editing. The tool monitors terminal settings to handle password prompts and single-keypress scenarios, supports custom completion dictionaries, maintains persistent per-command history, and includes a plugin system using Perl/Python filters for advanced input/output manipulation, making it essential for modernizing interaction with older CLI applications.
