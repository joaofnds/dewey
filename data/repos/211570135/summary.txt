This repository provides a comprehensive learning roadmap for software design and architecture, specifically targeting junior, self-taught, and intermediate developers in web development who want to advance their skills beyond basic programming. Created by a JavaScript/TypeScript developer, the roadmap addresses the common problem of developers lacking structured guidance on software architecture principles, design patterns, and system design concepts. The resource focuses on full-stack software architecture education, covering topics from object-oriented design patterns to system architecture fundamentals. Rather than containing code, this educational repository serves as a visual learning map and curriculum guide, helping developers navigate the complex landscape of software architecture concepts systematically. The roadmap is particularly oriented toward developers working with TypeScript and modern web technologies who need to transition from writing functional code to designing scalable, maintainable software systems.
