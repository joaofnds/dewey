`inf-clojure` is an Emacs package providing an enhanced REPL interface for interactive Clojure, ClojureScript, and ClojureCLR development. It offers features including code evaluation, completion, definition lookup, documentation retrieval, ElDoc integration, and socket REPL support. Built in Emacs Lisp, the package facilitates interaction with various Clojure REPLs like Lumo, Planck, and Babashka, based on the `comint` package. This project functions as an Emacs extension, enhancing developer productivity by simplifying Clojure REPL interaction directly within the Emacs environment, targeting Clojure developers.
