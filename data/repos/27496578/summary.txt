inf-clojure is an Emacs Lisp package that provides basic REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interaction with Clojure subprocess environments for functional programming development. Built on Emacs's comint framework, it supports multiple Clojure dialects including Clojure, ClojureScript, ClojureCLR, Planck, Joker, and babashka through both terminal and socket REPL connections. The package offers essential interactive development features like code evaluation, completion, documentation lookup, ElDoc integration, apropos search, macroexpansion, and namespace reloading. Targeting Clojure developers using Emacs as their IDE, inf-clojure serves as a lightweight alternative to more complex tools like CIDER, focusing on simplicity by leveraging native REPL capabilities rather than requiring specialized tooling or middleware for Lisp-based functional programming workflows.
