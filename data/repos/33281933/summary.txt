JSONb Accessor is a Ruby gem that extends ActiveRecord models with typed accessor methods for PostgreSQL's jsonb column data, targeting Ruby on Rails web developers. It provides a declarative API to define strongly-typed virtual attributes (string, integer, datetime, etc.) that are automatically serialized to and from jsonb storage, similar to HstoreAccessor but leveraging jsonb's superior nested document and collection support. The gem includes specialized query scopes for filtering jsonb data with comparison operators, time ranges, and boolean logic, eliminating the need for raw SQL when querying semi-structured data. It solves the common problem of storing flexible schema data in relational databases while maintaining ActiveRecord's familiar attribute interface and validation system.
