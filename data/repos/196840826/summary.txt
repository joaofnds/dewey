This repository contains the LaTeX source code for "The Science of Functional Programming," a comprehensive educational book targeting software developers learning functional programming paradigms. Written primarily in TeX/LaTeX with Scala code examples, the book provides theoretical foundations, mathematical proofs, and practical implementations of functional programming concepts including type theory, category theory, monads, and parametricity. The repository includes automated PDF build workflows via GitHub Actions, LyX document sources, and complete documentation covering three volumes of progressive difficulty. It serves functional programming educators, intermediate-to-advanced developers transitioning from imperative to functional paradigms, and computer science students studying programming language theory. The project addresses the gap between practical functional programming tutorials and rigorous mathematical foundations, offering a bridge between academic theory and real-world application development.
