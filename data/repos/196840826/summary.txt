The `winitzki/sofp` repository hosts the source code and build scripts for a free textbook, "The Science of Functional Programming," covering theoretical concepts relevant to functional programming. It is written in TeX, with the primary artifact being a PDF document generated from LyX/LaTeX source. The repository includes source files, shell scripts for PDF generation, and pre-built PDF versions (draft and final). This project functions as a self-contained tutorial resource, aimed at functional programming practitioners.
