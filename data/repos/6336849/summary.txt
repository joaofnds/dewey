dash.el is a modern functional programming library for Emacs Lisp that provides a comprehensive collection of list manipulation functions, serving as an alternative to Emacs' built-in `cl` library. Targeting Emacs developers and package authors, it offers over 100 functions for list operations including mapping, filtering, reduction, partitioning, and tree operations, along with anaphoric macro variants that use implicit `it` bindings for more concise code. The library addresses the limitation of Emacs Lisp's basic list processing capabilities by providing a consistent API with dash-prefixed function names, enabling functional programming patterns similar to those found in Clojure or Haskell. It includes developer experience enhancements like syntax highlighting for special variables, Info documentation integration, and comprehensive unit testing, making it essential infrastructure for modern Emacs Lisp development.
