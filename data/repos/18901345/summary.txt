lein-figwheel is a ClojureScript development tool that provides hot code reloading and interactive programming capabilities for web browser environments. Built as a Leiningen plugin for ClojureScript development, it automatically compiles ClojureScript source files and pushes changes to connected browsers in real-time without manual page refreshes. The tool includes a built-in static file server, CSS live reloading, ClojureScript REPL integration, and a heads-up display for compilation errors. It targets front-end web developers working with ClojureScript applications, solving the traditional edit-compile-refresh development cycle by enabling immediate feedback and interactive programming. The tool supports Node.js environments, handles dependency management, calculates minimal reload sets, and maintains robust WebSocket connections for broadcasting changes across multiple connected clients simultaneously.
