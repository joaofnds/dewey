Nord is a comprehensive color palette system designed for UI/UX design and syntax highlighting across development tools and applications. Built with SCSS and distributed as an npm package, it provides a carefully curated set of 16 arctic-themed, north-bluish colors optimized for accessibility and visual comfort. The palette targets web developers, UI designers, and software engineers who need consistent theming across IDEs, text editors, terminals, and web interfaces. Nord solves the problem of maintaining cohesive visual identity across diverse development environments by providing standardized color values that work effectively for both syntax highlighting in code editors and general UI theming, supporting the broader developer tooling ecosystem with a unified aesthetic framework.
