rbenv is a Ruby version management tool implemented in Shell/Bash that enables developers to seamlessly switch between multiple Ruby versions on Unix-like systems. Targeting Ruby developers and web development teams, it intercepts Ruby executable calls through PATH manipulation and uses `.ruby-version` files to automatically select the appropriate Ruby version per project directory. The tool scans project directories for version specifications and maps them to Ruby installations in `~/.rbenv/versions/`, providing project-level Ruby version isolation without requiring root privileges or system-wide configuration changes. rbenv addresses the common Ruby development problem of version conflicts between projects by offering a lightweight, plugin-extensible solution for managing Ruby runtime environments across different codebases and deployment contexts.
