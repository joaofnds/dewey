`rbenv` is a shell-based version manager tool for the Ruby programming language, facilitating the management and switching between multiple Ruby versions on Unix-like systems. It enables project-specific Ruby versioning through `.ruby-version` files, which directs `rbenv` to use the specified Ruby version within a project directory. Key functionalities include version selection via `rbenv local`, `rbenv global`, and `rbenv shell` commands, managing Ruby installations (with the `ruby-build` plugin), and ensuring consistent Ruby environments for diverse projects. This is a command-line tool (CLI) primarily targeting Ruby developers to enhance developer productivity by providing a consistent and reliable Ruby environment across projects.
