Hono is a TypeScript-based web framework built on Web Standards APIs, designed for multi-runtime JavaScript environments including Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, Deno, Bun, and Node.js. It targets web developers building serverless applications and edge computing solutions, featuring an ultrafast RegExpRouter for HTTP routing without linear loops, zero-dependency architecture using only Web Standard APIs, and comprehensive middleware support. The framework addresses the challenge of writing portable web applications that run consistently across different JavaScript runtimes and cloud platforms, particularly focusing on performance-critical serverless and edge computing scenarios where bundle size and execution speed are paramount for developers building modern web APIs and applications.
