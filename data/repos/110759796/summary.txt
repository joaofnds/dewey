`librespot` is an open-source Spotify client library written in Rust, enabling applications to control and play music via the Spotify service and function as a Spotify Connect receiver. Its core functionality includes interacting with the Spotify API for music playback, and acting as a receiver for Spotify Connect compatible devices. The project provides a command-line interface (CLI) for direct execution and includes integration with various audio backends such as ALSA, PulseAudio, and Rodio, demonstrating a focus on cross-platform compatibility. Primarily a library and standalone application, it targets developers and users seeking an alternative to the deprecated closed-source `libspotify`.
