Librespot is an open-source Rust library that implements a Spotify Connect client, enabling devices to act as Spotify receivers and playback endpoints. It reverse-engineers Spotify's proprietary protocol to provide an alternative to the deprecated libspotify SDK, targeting audio developers and system integrators building custom Spotify-enabled hardware or software solutions. The library supports multiple audio backends including ALSA, PulseAudio, JACK, GStreamer, and Rodio for cross-platform audio output, and requires Spotify Premium accounts for operation. Primary users include embedded systems developers, DIY audio enthusiasts, and software engineers creating custom Spotify Connect devices or integrating Spotify playback into existing audio systems and IoT projects.
