Meilisearch is a high-performance search engine API written in Rust that provides hybrid search capabilities combining full-text and vector-based semantic search. Targeting web developers and application builders, it offers sub-50ms search responses with features like typo tolerance, faceted search, geosearch, and search-as-you-type functionality. The engine serves as a drop-in solution for implementing search functionality in websites, mobile applications, and enterprise systems, supporting both traditional keyword matching and AI-powered semantic search through vector embeddings. It addresses the common developer challenge of building fast, accurate search experiences without the complexity of managing Elasticsearch or Solr, providing RESTful APIs for easy integration into existing web development workflows and modern application architectures.
