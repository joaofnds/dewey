**org-menu** is an Emacs package that provides a discoverable, context-aware menu system for org-mode document editing using the transient framework (the same interactive menu system used by magit). Targeting productivity-focused developers, researchers, and technical writers who use Emacs for document authoring and project management, it addresses the discoverability problem of org-mode's extensive feature set by presenting contextual menus for headlines, tables, and other org elements. The package integrates with org-mode's native functionality including columns, snippets, source code tangling, export systems, checkboxes, timestamps, and buffer options, while optionally leveraging yasnippet for templating. It serves the technical writing and personal knowledge management domain by making org-mode's powerful but complex feature set more accessible through a guided interface, eliminating the need to memorize numerous keyboard shortcuts and command names.
