This TypeScript library provides a Promise-based wrapper around the browser's native IndexedDB API, targeting web developers working with client-side data persistence. It maintains the core IndexedDB functionality while replacing callback-based operations with modern async/await patterns, reducing the library size to ~1.19kB brotli'd. The package addresses IndexedDB's notorious usability issues by adding Promise support, enhanced error handling, async iterators for cursors, and improved TypeScript definitions while preserving the original API structure. It's designed for frontend developers building web applications that require local database storage, offering seamless integration with modern JavaScript frameworks and build tools like webpack and Rollup, and supports all modern browsers except Internet Explorer.
