`idb` is a TypeScript library providing a promise-based and enhanced interface for interacting with IndexedDB, a client-side, NoSQL database API for web browsers. It streamlines IndexedDB usage by returning promises for IDBRequest objects, simplifying asynchronous operations and providing usability improvements. The library features enhancements to `IDBDatabase`, `IDBTransaction`, and `IDBCursor` objects, including shortcut methods for common database interactions and support for async iterators. This library facilitates easier IndexedDB integration, offering a developer-friendly approach to local data storage within web applications.
