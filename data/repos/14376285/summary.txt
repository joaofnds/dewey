xbar is a macOS menu bar integration tool that enables system administrators and developers to display output from any script or program directly in the macOS menu bar. Built as a complete rewrite of BitBar using Go and the Wails framework for cross-platform desktop applications, it serves the DevOps and system monitoring domain by providing a scriptable interface for real-time system information display. The application manages a plugin ecosystem where executable scripts in any language can generate formatted output that appears as menu bar items, enabling custom monitoring dashboards, system metrics, API status checks, and automation controls. Target users include DevOps engineers, system administrators, and macOS developers who need persistent visibility into system states, application metrics, or custom data sources without switching between applications or terminal windows.
