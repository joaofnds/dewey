`xbar` is a standalone macOS application enabling users to display output from scripts and programs directly in the macOS menu bar, functioning as a modern replacement for BitBar. Built with Go and utilizing the Wails framework for cross-platform desktop application development, it allows users to execute scripts and render their output dynamically in the menu bar.  Key features include a plugin system for extending functionality, with plugins managed through a dedicated plugin directory, and a focus on scriptability and developer customization. This developer productivity tool targets macOS users and developers seeking to enhance system monitoring and integrate custom information into their macOS interface.
