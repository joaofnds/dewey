Rectangle is a macOS window management utility written in Swift that provides keyboard shortcuts and drag-to-snap functionality for programmatically resizing and positioning application windows. Built as a successor to Spectacle, it targets macOS power users, developers, and system administrators who need efficient window organization workflows. The application integrates with macOS accessibility APIs to control window geometry, supports URL-based automation for scripting integration, and offers extensive window positioning options including halves, thirds, quarters, and custom grid layouts. Rectangle addresses the productivity bottleneck of manual window management on macOS by providing Windows-style window snapping capabilities and customizable keyboard shortcuts, making it particularly valuable for developers working with multiple applications, terminal windows, and code editors simultaneously.
