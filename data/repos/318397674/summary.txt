SSB is a command-line SSH brute-force attack tool written in Go, designed for cybersecurity professionals and penetration testers to perform credential-based security assessments against SSH servers. The tool implements concurrent connection attempts with configurable threading (default 100), timeout handling, retry mechanisms, and wordlist-based password enumeration to systematically test authentication credentials on target SSH services. It provides essential features for security testing including custom port specification, connection timeout controls, result logging, and verbose output modes. The tool addresses the need for efficient SSH service security validation in penetration testing workflows, offering faster execution through Go's concurrency model compared to traditional shell-based brute-forcing approaches. Target users include security researchers, ethical hackers, and system administrators conducting authorized security assessments on SSH infrastructure.
