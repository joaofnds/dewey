Stack is a cross-platform build tool and project manager for Haskell programming language development, serving as a comprehensive toolchain for compiling, building, and managing Haskell projects and their dependencies. Built in Haskell itself, Stack addresses the complexity of Haskell package management by providing reproducible builds through curated package snapshots (Stackage), automatic GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) installation and management, and isolated project environments. The tool targets both novice and experienced Haskell developers working on functional programming projects, eliminating common dependency conflicts and version compatibility issues that plague traditional Cabal-based workflows. Stack integrates with the broader Haskell ecosystem including Hackage package repository while providing a more reliable and user-friendly development experience for software engineering teams building applications, libraries, and systems in the functional programming domain.
