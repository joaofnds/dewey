markdown-preview.nvim is a JavaScript-based plugin for Vim and Neovim editors that provides real-time Markdown preview functionality in modern web browsers. Targeting developers and technical writers who work extensively with Markdown documentation, the plugin addresses the workflow inefficiency of switching between editors and preview tools. It implements a local server architecture with WebSocket-based synchronization for live preview updates, synchronized scrolling, and asynchronous rendering. The plugin integrates multiple JavaScript libraries including KaTeX for mathematical notation, PlantUML and Mermaid for diagrams, Chart.js for data visualization, and various flowchart engines. Built on Node.js with a web-based rendering engine, it transforms the traditional text-editing experience into an interactive documentation authoring environment, particularly valuable for software developers creating README files, technical documentation, and project wikis within their established Vim/Neovim workflows.
