Distillery is a deprecated Elixir library that generates OTP (Open Telecom Platform) releases for Elixir applications, enabling deployment without requiring Erlang/Elixir runtime installation on target systems. Built for DevOps and deployment automation, it transforms Mix projects into self-contained, distributable packages that include all necessary dependencies and the Erlang Virtual Machine. The tool addresses the challenge of deploying Elixir applications in production environments by creating standalone releases that can be deployed across different systems independently. Targeting Elixir developers and DevOps engineers, Distillery served as the primary release management solution before its functionality was integrated into Mix releases in Elixir 1.9, supporting Erlang 20+ and providing dependency-free release generation for distributed systems deployment.
