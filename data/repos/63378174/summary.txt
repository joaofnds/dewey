`bitwalker/distillery` is a deprecated Elixir library designed for simplifying the deployment of Elixir applications by generating Erlang/OTP releases. It takes an Elixir Mix project and packages its components into a standalone release, enabling deployment independent of an Erlang/Elixir installation. The library offers functionality for creating distributable packages, targeting the deployment and distribution domain. As a pure-Elixir package, it integrates directly into Elixir projects via a Mix dependency. It targets Elixir developers focused on application deployment.
