`k9s` is a standalone, terminal-based user interface (TUI) application, written in Go, designed for managing Kubernetes clusters. Its primary function is to provide a streamlined and interactive command-line experience for navigating, observing, and managing Kubernetes resources such as pods, deployments, and services. Key features include real-time monitoring, resource filtering, command aliases, hotkey support, and custom view configurations, with integration of Popeye for cluster sanitization and support for port forwarding. The project is intended for system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who need efficient interaction with Kubernetes clusters, and it leverages the `go` programming language and the Kubernetes API.
