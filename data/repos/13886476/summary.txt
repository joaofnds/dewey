**zsh-autosuggestions** is a Zsh shell plugin that implements Fish shell-style command autosuggestions for Unix/Linux terminal environments. Built entirely in Shell script, it provides real-time command suggestions based on shell history and tab-completion engines as users type commands. The plugin integrates with the Zsh Line Editor (ZLE) widget system to deliver non-intrusive gray-text suggestions that can be accepted via arrow keys or end-of-line navigation. It supports configurable suggestion strategies (history-based, completion-based, or previous command matching), customizable highlighting styles, and widget mapping for different acceptance behaviors. Primarily targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and command-line power users, it enhances terminal productivity by reducing typing overhead and improving command recall in development, server management, and automation workflows.
