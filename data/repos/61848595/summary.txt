This repository serves as a comprehensive educational resource for learning RxJS, the reactive programming library for JavaScript. Built primarily with TypeScript, it targets web developers seeking to master asynchronous event handling and reactive programming paradigms. The repository provides structured documentation covering RxJS operators (combination, filtering, transformation, error handling), Subjects (AsyncSubject, BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject), core Observable concepts, and practical implementation recipes including games, UI components, and common web patterns like HTTP polling and type-ahead functionality. It addresses the steep learning curve associated with transitioning from imperative to declarative programming styles in JavaScript applications, offering executable examples and clear explanations to supplement official RxJS documentation for frontend and full-stack developers working with event-driven architectures.
