git-bug is a distributed, offline-first issue tracking system built in Go that embeds bug reports and project management data as Git objects rather than files within repositories. Targeting software development teams and DevOps workflows, it leverages Git's decentralized architecture to enable distributed issue management without requiring centralized servers or continuous connectivity. The system provides CLI, TUI, and web interfaces for issue management and includes bridge integrations for synchronizing with external platforms like GitHub and GitLab. By storing issues as versioned Git objects, it solves the problem of fragmented issue tracking across distributed development workflows, allowing developers to manage bugs and feature requests using the same Git infrastructure they already use for code, enabling seamless offline work and distributed collaboration.
