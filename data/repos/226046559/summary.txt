This repository contains example configurations and tutorial materials for Shipyard, a development environment orchestration tool. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform developers, it provides shell-based blueprint definitions that demonstrate how to set up containerized development stacks and infrastructure scenarios. The blueprints serve as reference implementations for creating reproducible development environments, likely utilizing Docker containers, Kubernetes clusters, and associated tooling. The repository functions as a learning resource and template collection for teams adopting Shipyard for local development environment management, testing infrastructure automation, and prototyping distributed system architectures. It addresses the common DevOps challenge of maintaining consistent, portable development environments across different machines and team members.
