RabbitMQ Server is an open-source message broker and streaming platform implementing multiple messaging protocols including AMQP 0-9-1, AMQP 1.0, MQTT, STOMP, and WebSocket variants. Built on Erlang/OTP for high concurrency and fault tolerance, it serves enterprise software architecture and distributed systems domains by enabling asynchronous communication, message queuing, and event streaming between applications and microservices. The server provides quorum queues for data consistency, persistent streams for append-only logging, clustering capabilities, and comprehensive monitoring tools. Targeted at backend developers, system architects, and DevOps engineers, it solves decoupling, scalability, and reliability challenges in message-driven architectures, supporting both traditional publish-subscribe patterns and modern streaming workloads across cloud-native and on-premises deployments.
