This Emacs Lisp package enables multiple major modes within a single Emacs buffer, allowing different syntax highlighting, indentation, and editing behaviors for different sections of code. Primarily targeting software developers and technical writers working with polyglot documents, it solves the problem of editing files containing multiple programming languages or markup formats (such as HTML with embedded CSS/JavaScript, literate programming documents, or template files with mixed syntax). The package extends Emacs' built-in major mode system to dynamically switch context based on buffer regions, providing appropriate language-specific features for each section. This functionality is particularly valuable for web developers working with templating systems, documentation writers using formats like Org-mode with code blocks, and developers maintaining configuration files with embedded scripts.
