`LearnGitBranching` is a browser-based, interactive educational application designed to visualize and teach Git version control concepts.  Built using JavaScript, it features a visual Git repository representation that dynamically updates based on user-entered commands, providing a sandbox environment for experimentation and a series of challenge levels to reinforce learning. The application includes a level builder for creating custom Git challenges and a sharing mechanism for custom command sequences via URL parameters, making it a developer productivity tool targeting individuals learning and mastering Git.  The project is structured as a standalone web application and leverages Gulp for building and Yarn for dependency management.
