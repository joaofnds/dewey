LearnGitBranching is a client-side JavaScript educational application that provides interactive Git version control visualization and training for software developers. Built with JavaScript and Gulp.js tooling, it renders dynamic commit tree diagrams that update in real-time as users execute Git commands, helping developers understand branching, merging, rebasing, and remote repository operations through visual feedback. The application operates entirely in the browser without backend dependencies, offering sandbox mode for experimentation, structured tutorial levels with progression tracking, and a level builder for creating custom challenges. It targets developers across all experience levels who need to master Git workflows, addressing the common problem of understanding complex Git operations that are difficult to visualize through command-line interfaces alone.
