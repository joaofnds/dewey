Barrier is an open-source KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) software solution that enables users to control multiple computers using a single keyboard and mouse across a network. Built in C with cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD, it functions as a software-based KVM switch that allows seamless cursor movement between machines by reaching screen edges or using hotkeys. The application operates in a client-server architecture where one machine acts as the input server sharing its peripherals with client machines over TCP/IP. Forked from Synergy 1.9, it targets system administrators, power users, and multi-computer setups requiring simplified peripheral management. Key features include clipboard synchronization, SSL encryption, and GUI configuration tools for screen layout management in heterogeneous computing environments.
