`Barrier` is an open-source, C-language application designed to share a single keyboard and mouse across multiple computers, mimicking the functionality of a KVM switch. It enables cross-platform control of Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD systems, supporting clipboard sharing. The project is a standalone GUI/CLI application for end-users and aims for hassle-free reliability and compatibility, built upon a codebase forked from the Synergy 1.9 project.
