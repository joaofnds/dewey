Docker Machine is a Go-based infrastructure provisioning tool designed for containerized application deployment and management in DevOps environments. It automates the creation and configuration of Docker hosts across multiple platforms including local VirtualBox VMs, cloud providers (DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure), and on-premises data centers. The tool handles server provisioning, Docker Engine installation, TLS certificate management, and SSH key configuration, then configures the local Docker client to communicate with remote Docker daemons. It features an extensible driver plugin architecture supporting various virtualization technologies and cloud platforms. Docker Machine primarily targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers who need to programmatically manage Docker infrastructure across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, solving the complexity of consistent Docker host deployment and configuration management at scale.
