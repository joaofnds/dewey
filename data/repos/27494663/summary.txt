`docker/machine` is a command-line tool facilitating Docker host management across various environments. Its core function is to create, configure, and manage Docker hosts, including local virtual machines and cloud provider instances. Written in Go, it leverages drivers to provision Docker environments on platforms like VirtualBox and DigitalOcean. Users interact with `docker-machine` via a CLI to provision Docker hosts, configure the Docker client, and manage the lifecycle of the Docker engine on remote machines.
