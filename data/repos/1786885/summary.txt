MoonScript is a programming language that compiles to Lua, designed to provide a more programmer-friendly syntax and feature set compared to standard Lua. Functionality includes features such as a built-in compiler, self-hosting capabilities, and a testing framework leveraging Busted. The project is a transpiler, enabling developers to write code in MoonScript and generate Lua output, thereby benefiting from Lua's performance and ecosystem. Precompiled binaries are available, and the project supports integration with various text editors, targeting developers who prefer a more expressive and modern syntax for Lua-based projects.
