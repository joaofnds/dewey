MoonScript is a transpiler that compiles a programmer-friendly language into Lua, targeting developers working with Lua-based applications and game development. Built as a self-hosted compiler written in MoonScript itself, it uses parsing expression grammar to transform MoonScript syntax into compatible Lua code that runs on Lua 5.1+ and LuaJIT runtimes. The project addresses the verbosity and syntactic limitations of traditional Lua by providing enhanced language features while maintaining full compatibility with the Lua ecosystem. Primary users are game developers, embedded systems programmers, and application developers who need Lua's performance characteristics but prefer more expressive syntax, particularly in domains like game scripting, web development with OpenResty, and embedded scripting environments.
