`qrenco.de` is a Python-based web service and command-line tool for generating QR codes from strings. It leverages `libqrencode` for QR code generation and can be accessed via HTTP requests using tools like `curl`, `httpie`, or a web browser. The service is installable locally and provides instructions for integration with web servers like Nginx to serve as a frontend. This project is a standalone web application, targeting developers needing a simple way to encode text into QR codes through a RESTful interface or CLI.
