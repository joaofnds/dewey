This repository serves as an archived version of The Coding Train's educational website, built with JavaScript to support creative coding and programming education. The platform functions as a content management system for organizing video tutorials, community code contributions, and learning resources focused on computational art, design, and programming concepts. It targets programming educators, students, and creative developers interested in generative art and interactive media development. The archive maintains the original website structure that facilitated community-driven content contributions, video tutorial indexing, and code sharing workflows for YouTube-based programming education. While no longer actively maintained, it preserves the technical infrastructure that supported collaborative learning in creative coding domains, particularly for Processing, p5.js, and related creative programming frameworks used in digital art and educational content creation.
