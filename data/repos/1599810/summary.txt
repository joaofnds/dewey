`ditaa` is a standalone Java command-line utility designed to convert diagrams drawn using ASCII art into bitmap graphics. Functionality includes rendering shapes, colors, dashed lines, and text with specific markup syntax within the ASCII diagrams to generate images. Its architecture centers on a Java runtime environment, and incorporates support for HTML integration, allowing for diagrams embedded within HTML `<pre>` tags to be rendered. It targets developers and users seeking to modernize or incorporate diagrams within text-based formats like HTML, and offers features for producing diagrams from text-based ASCII art with reusability and scalability.
