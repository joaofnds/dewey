ditaa is a Java-based command-line utility that converts ASCII art diagrams into high-quality bitmap and SVG graphics, targeting documentation and technical writing workflows. The tool serves developers, technical writers, and system architects who need to embed diagrams in text-based formats like HTML, DocBook, LaTeX, and code comments. It parses ASCII characters (|, /, -, \) as geometric shapes and applies rendering enhancements including anti-aliasing, drop shadows, round corners, color coding, and special symbols for flowcharts and system diagrams. ditaa addresses the problem of maintaining readable diagrams in version-controlled documentation by keeping source diagrams as editable ASCII text while generating professional-looking visual outputs. The utility integrates into documentation toolchains and supports both standalone processing and HTML embedding, making it valuable for DevOps documentation, software architecture diagrams, and legacy document modernization.
