This Go package provides a TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) parser and encoder for configuration file processing, targeting software developers and DevOps engineers who need structured configuration management. Built with Go's reflection system, it offers a familiar API similar to the standard library's JSON and XML packages, enabling seamless marshaling/unmarshaling of TOML data into Go structs. The library supports TOML v1.0.0 specification, struct tags for field mapping, and custom unmarshaling interfaces including `encoding.TextUnmarshaler` and `UnmarshalTOML`. It addresses the common need for human-readable configuration files in applications, system administration tools, and deployment pipelines, providing both programmatic parsing capabilities and a CLI validation tool for TOML file verification.
