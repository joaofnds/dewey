The `BurntSushi/toml` repository provides a TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) parser and decoder library for the Go programming language, enabling the parsing of TOML configuration files. It leverages Go's reflection capabilities to map TOML data to Go structs, similar to the standard `json` and `xml` packages. Key functionalities include decoding TOML files into Go data structures, support for custom unmarshaling via interfaces like `encoding.TextUnmarshaler`, and a command-line interface (CLI) tool for TOML validation. This is a Go library primarily targeted towards developers working with configuration files.
