org-graph-view is an Emacs Lisp extension that transforms Org-mode documents into interactive, clickable graphical mind maps within the Emacs editor environment. Targeting knowledge workers, researchers, and technical writers who use Emacs for documentation and note-taking, this tool addresses the limitation of traditional hierarchical text-based organization by providing visual graph representations of Org buffer content. Built specifically for the Emacs ecosystem using Emacs Lisp, it integrates with org-mode's structured document format to generate navigable visual maps where users can click through interconnected nodes. The tool serves the productivity and knowledge management domain, enabling users to visualize relationships between topics, tasks, and notes that would otherwise remain hidden in linear text structures, particularly benefiting technical professionals who maintain complex documentation systems.
