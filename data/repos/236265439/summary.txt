`org-graph-view` is an Emacs Lisp plugin designed to visualize Org-mode buffers as interactive mind maps. It provides a graphical, clickable interface for navigating and understanding complex Org-mode documents, enhancing user productivity and information comprehension within the Emacs environment. Leveraging the Emacs Lisp language and targeting the Emacs editor, this project extends Org-mode functionality with a visual, hierarchical representation of the user's Org-mode data. It functions as an extension to the Emacs text editor.
