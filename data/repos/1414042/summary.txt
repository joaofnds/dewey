Caveman2 is a lightweight web application framework for Common Lisp that provides a complete foundation for building web applications in the Lisp ecosystem. Built on top of ningle and Clack/Lack, it offers Sinatra-style HTTP routing through `@route` annotations and `defroute` macros, integrated database support via CL-DBI with connection management, template rendering capabilities, and configuration management through the Envy system. The framework includes project scaffolding tools, supports multiple web servers (Hunchentoot, Woo, Wookie), and provides both micro-framework simplicity and full-stack features like database integration. Targeting Common Lisp developers building web applications, Caveman2 addresses the need for a practical, extensible web framework that bridges the gap between minimal routing libraries and heavyweight enterprise frameworks while maintaining Lisp's functional programming paradigms.
