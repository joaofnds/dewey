Yaegi is a Go language interpreter written in pure Go that enables dynamic execution of Go code at runtime without compilation. It targets Go developers and system administrators who need embedded scripting capabilities, plugin systems, or interactive Go environments. The interpreter provides a simple API (`New()`, `Eval()`, `Use()`) for embedding Go script execution into applications, supports the complete Go specification, and includes safety features by restricting `unsafe` and `syscall` packages by default. Primary use cases include creating dynamic extension frameworks, interactive REPLs, Go-based scripting solutions, and runtime plugin architectures. It serves the Go ecosystem by bridging the gap between compiled Go applications and interpreted scripting needs, particularly useful for configuration systems, automation tools, and applications requiring runtime code evaluation without external dependencies.
