`see` is a Rust-based, standalone web server designed for serving static content and handling web requests.  It leverages Tokio and Hyper for asynchronous HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 support, incorporating features such as TLS encryption via Rustls, content compression, rewrite rules, and reverse proxy functionality. The project provides a CLI executable installable via Cargo or Docker, enabling users to configure server behavior through a configuration file or command-line arguments, with documentation available.  This is a command-line application primarily intended for system administrators and developers needing a lightweight and performant web server.
