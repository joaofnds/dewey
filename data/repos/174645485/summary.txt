**see** is a standalone static web server written in Rust, designed for web development and DevOps environments. Built on Tokio async runtime and Hyper HTTP library, it serves static files with support for HTTP/1, HTTP/2, TLS encryption via Rustls, content compression (gzip, deflate, brotli), reverse proxy capabilities, and basic authentication. The server targets system administrators and developers who need a lightweight, single-binary web server for hosting static content, development environments, or simple production deployments. It features configuration-driven setup with regex-based URL rewriting, IP allow/deny rules, custom error handling, and logging. The project addresses the need for a fast, dependency-free alternative to traditional web servers like Apache or Nginx for static content serving scenarios.
