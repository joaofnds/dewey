Material Design Lite (MDL) is a front-end UI component library that implements Google's Material Design specification using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without dependencies on external frameworks. Targeting web developers building static websites and web applications, MDL provides pre-built components like buttons, cards, navigation elements, and form controls that follow Material Design principles. The library focuses on cross-browser compatibility (IE9+), accessibility, and graceful degradation for older browsers. Currently in limited support mode with development moved to Material Components for Web, MDL serves developers who need lightweight Material Design styling without the overhead of larger JavaScript frameworks, making it suitable for content-focused websites requiring modern, responsive design patterns.
