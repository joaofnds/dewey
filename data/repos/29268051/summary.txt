Material Design Lite (MDL) is a front-end library providing Material Design components for web development, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It enables developers to rapidly integrate Google's Material Design visual language into websites, offering pre-built UI elements and styling without relying on external JavaScript frameworks. MDL is optimized for cross-device compatibility and degrades gracefully in older browsers. This project is a library, targeted at web developers seeking a lightweight and accessible implementation of the Material Design system.
