`goldly` is a ClojureScript kernel leveraging the `sci` interpreter for interactive ClojureScript execution within a web browser environment. This project uses `webly` and `shadow-cljs` to create lazy-loadable JavaScript modules and incorporates `sci-configs` for module creation based on namespace mappings.  It enables the creation of custom UI renderers, allowing developers to extend functionality via JavaScript bundle customization, targeting Clojure/ClojureScript developers building interactive applications. The project is primarily a library and development tool.
