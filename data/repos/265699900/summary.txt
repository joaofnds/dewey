Goldly is a ClojureScript kernel implementation that leverages the SCI (Small Clojure Interpreter) to enable dynamic code evaluation in web environments. Built for the data science and interactive computing domain, it integrates with the reval ecosystem to provide notebook-style computational environments similar to Jupyter kernels but for Clojure/ClojureScript. The system uses webly for lazy-loadable JavaScript module generation via shadow-cljs compilation, enabling modular UI component loading. Goldly consists of two core sub-projects: goldly-sci for SCI interpreter configuration with shadow-cljs integration, and sci-configs for namespace mapping modules. It targets Clojure developers and data scientists who need interactive, web-based computational notebooks with custom UI renderers, supporting dynamic code execution through Reagent-based React components while maintaining the flexibility to extend functionality through custom JavaScript bundles.
