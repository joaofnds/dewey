JAX is a Python library for accelerator-oriented numerical computing and machine learning that provides composable function transformations including automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, and vectorization. Built on XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra), it enables high-performance computation on GPUs and TPUs by transforming NumPy-compatible Python code into optimized kernels. The library targets machine learning researchers and practitioners who need efficient gradient computation for neural networks, scientific computing applications requiring automatic differentiation, and scenarios demanding scalable numerical computation across hardware accelerators. Key transformations include `jax.grad` for reverse-mode and forward-mode differentiation, `jax.jit` for XLA compilation, and `jax.vmap` for automatic vectorization, allowing users to compose these operations arbitrarily while maintaining NumPy's familiar API for array operations and mathematical functions.
