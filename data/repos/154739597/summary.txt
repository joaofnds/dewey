JAX is a Python library designed for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning, offering composable function transformations for array computations. Core functionalities include automatic differentiation with `jax.grad`, just-in-time compilation using `jax.jit` via XLA for GPU/TPU acceleration, and auto-vectorization with `jax.vmap` for efficient operations on array axes. This library enables scalable numerical programs with support for compiler-based automatic parallelization, explicit sharding, and per-device programming paradigms, catering to researchers and developers working on computationally intensive tasks. It is a research project providing a framework for manipulating numerical programs.
