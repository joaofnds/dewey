Graphiti is a Ruby framework designed to build JSON:API-compliant APIs, primarily for web application backends. It abstracts common API development concerns like serialization, filtering, sorting, and sideloading, enabling developers to define resources instead of controllers and serializers. Built on top of Ruby on Rails (implied through the use of `ApplicationResource` and other Rails conventions), it leverages a resource-oriented approach for organized and maintainable API logic. This project functions as a library/framework, offering developers a streamlined approach to creating and managing API endpoints.
