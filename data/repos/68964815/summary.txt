Graphiti is a Ruby framework for building JSON:API-compliant REST APIs in Rails applications, designed for web developers working on microservices architectures. It provides a resource-oriented abstraction layer that sits above ActiveRecord models, handling common API concerns like serialization, filtering, sorting, pagination, and relationship sideloading through declarative resource definitions. The framework eliminates boilerplate code by allowing developers to define API behavior through resource classes rather than traditional controller/serializer patterns, supporting complex queries with filtering operators, custom sorting logic, and polymorphic relationships. Targeted at Ruby on Rails developers building data-driven web APIs, Graphiti streamlines the creation of sophisticated REST endpoints while maintaining strict adherence to JSON:API specifications for consistent client-server communication.
