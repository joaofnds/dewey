Vim-gin is a Git repository management plugin for Vim/Neovim editors built on the Denops ecosystem using TypeScript and Deno runtime. It provides comprehensive Git workflow integration including commands for status viewing (`GinStatus`), branch management (`GinBranch`), diff visualization (`GinDiff`), interactive staging (`GinPatch`), conflict resolution (`GinChaperon`), and repository browsing (`GinBrowse`). The plugin proxies Git prompts and editors through Vim, offers statusline/tabline components for repository information, and supports both raw Git command execution and structured buffer-based interfaces. Targeted at software developers and DevOps professionals who prefer terminal-based editors, it addresses the need for seamless Git operations without leaving the Vim environment, competing with established solutions like vim-fugitive while leveraging modern asynchronous TypeScript architecture through the Denops framework.
