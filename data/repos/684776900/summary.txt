Bend is a high-level, massively parallel programming language designed for high-performance computing, particularly on GPUs. Built in Rust, it leverages the HVM2 runtime to enable parallel execution without explicit parallelism annotations, supporting features found in languages like Python and Haskell, including higher-order functions and recursion. Key functionalities include the ability to run code on multiple cores and NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA, achieving near-linear performance scaling with core count; users can utilize the `bend run-cu` command to compile and run programs on a CUDA-enabled GPU. This project provides a standalone application (CLI) and example code for developers seeking to optimize computationally intensive tasks on parallel hardware.
