bbolt is an embedded key-value database library written in Go, serving as an actively maintained fork of Ben Johnson's Bolt database. It provides a pure Go implementation inspired by LMDB, designed for applications requiring local data persistence without the overhead of full database servers like PostgreSQL or MySQL. The library targets Go developers building backend services, CLI tools, and embedded systems who need ACID-compliant transactions, B+tree storage, and single-file database functionality. bbolt supports concurrent read-only transactions, exclusive read-write transactions, nested buckets, and memory-mapped file I/O for performance. It's primarily used in distributed systems, DevOps tooling, and applications requiring reliable local storage, with production deployments handling databases up to 1TB in companies like Shopify and Heroku.
