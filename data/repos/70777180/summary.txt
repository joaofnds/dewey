Mailspring is a cross-platform desktop email client built with Electron, React, and TypeScript that targets end-users seeking an alternative to traditional mail applications on Mac, Windows, and Linux. The application implements a hybrid architecture combining a JavaScript-based UI with a C++ sync engine built on Mailcore2 for IMAP protocol handling, reducing resource consumption compared to pure JavaScript implementations. It provides standard email client functionality including unified inbox, message composition, and mail synchronization, while supporting extensibility through a plugin architecture. The codebase serves the productivity software domain, specifically email management, and is designed for both regular users and developers who want to extend functionality through custom plugins and themes using web technologies.
