org-super-agenda is an Emacs Lisp package that enhances Org-mode's agenda functionality by adding intelligent grouping capabilities to daily/weekly agenda views. It intercepts agenda items during the `org-agenda-finalize-entries` phase and applies customizable filters to organize tasks into logical sections based on criteria like tags, TODO keywords, priorities, deadlines, and scheduling timestamps. Unlike custom agenda commands that lose temporal context, this package preserves the time-based nature of standard agenda views while providing structured organization. The package targets Emacs power users and productivity enthusiasts who rely on Org-mode for task management and project planning, solving the problem of overwhelming agenda lists by creating categorized, hierarchical views that maintain chronological relevance while improving visual organization and task prioritization.
