Lem is a Common Lisp-based text editor and integrated development environment (IDE) specifically optimized for Common Lisp development workflows. Built entirely in Common Lisp, it targets software developers working in the Lisp ecosystem who need a specialized editing environment with deep language integration. The editor features built-in Language Server Protocol (LSP) client support for multi-language development, offers both Emacs and Vim editing modes, and includes development-focused tools like project exploration, interactive grep/git interfaces, and multiple cursor support. Available in both ncurses (terminal) and SDL2 (graphical) variants, Lem provides cross-platform compatibility across GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows. It addresses the problem of requiring extensive configuration and plugin installation typically needed with general-purpose editors like Emacs for effective Lisp development, offering an out-of-the-box solution tailored specifically for Common Lisp programmers.
