The `rtomayko/posix-spawn` repository provides a Ruby library to efficiently spawn child processes, offering a faster alternative to `fork(2)` and `exec` for Ruby applications. It implements a subset of the Ruby 1.9 `Process::spawn` interface, leveraging `posix_spawn()` when available and providing fallbacks on other systems, and also enhances `Kernel#system`, `Kernel#`\`\`\`\`, and `IO::popen`. The library features a `POSIX::Spawn::Child` class for streamlined, non-streaming IPC, and includes benchmarks demonstrating its performance advantages, with support for environment variable manipulation, redirection, and process group management. This is a Ruby library intended for developers to improve process spawning performance and functionality.
