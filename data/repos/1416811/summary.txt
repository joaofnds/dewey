The posix-spawn library is a Ruby process spawning optimization library that addresses performance bottlenecks in fork/exec operations for systems programming and DevOps applications. It implements a subset of Ruby 1.9's Process::spawn interface using POSIX posix_spawn() and vfork() system calls to achieve constant-time process creation, avoiding the memory overhead of traditional fork() calls that must copy page tables. The library provides both low-level spawning interfaces compatible with Process::spawn and high-level Child classes for IPC scenarios, targeting Ruby developers building system utilities, deployment tools, and server applications that frequently spawn child processes. It includes C extensions for performance optimization and offers enhanced versions of Kernel#system and IO operations, making it particularly valuable for DevOps tooling and system administration scripts where process spawning performance is critical.
