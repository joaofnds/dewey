`neodark.vim` is a Vim color scheme designed to provide a dark visual theme for the Vim text editor. It offers customizable options, including terminal transparency, solid vertical split styles, and italics support. The color scheme provides integrated themes for popular status line plugins, namely, `airline` and `lightline`. Moreover, it includes custom terminal themes to enable true color support, particularly useful for terminals without native true color capabilities. This plugin targets Vim users who desire a visually appealing and configurable coding environment.
