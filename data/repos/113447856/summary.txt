Rustic is an Emacs Lisp package that provides a comprehensive Rust development environment within the Emacs text editor, targeting systems programmers and Rust developers. Built as an enhanced fork of rust-mode, it integrates essential Rust toolchain components including cargo build system commands, rustfmt code formatting, clippy linting, and LSP (Language Server Protocol) support through rust-analyzer with both eglot and lsp-mode clients. The package addresses common Rust development workflow pain points by offering async compilation with multiline error parsing, ANSI color sequence translation, cargo project management through interactive popups, org-babel integration for literate programming, and automatic LSP configuration. It solves the fragmented tooling experience by unifying cargo commands, error navigation, code formatting, and intelligent code completion into a cohesive Emacs-native development environment for Rust programming.
