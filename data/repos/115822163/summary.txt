This JavaScript-based web application provides an educational demonstration of public-private key cryptography concepts specifically within blockchain contexts. Built as a Node.js web server, it offers an interactive browser-based interface that visualizes key pair generation, digital signing processes, and cryptographic verification mechanisms fundamental to blockchain technology. The demo serves as a pedagogical tool for developers, students, and blockchain enthusiasts seeking to understand asymmetric cryptography principles through hands-on experimentation. As part of a "Blockchain 101" educational series, it bridges theoretical cryptographic concepts with practical implementation, allowing users to generate key pairs, sign messages, and verify signatures in real-time. The application targets web developers and blockchain learners who need concrete examples of how public-key infrastructure operates in distributed ledger systems.
