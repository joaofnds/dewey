Tunnelblick is an open-source macOS GUI application built in Objective-C that provides a graphical interface for managing OpenVPN client and server connections. Targeting the network security and VPN administration domain, it serves as a native macOS wrapper around the OpenVPN open-source VPN protocol implementation. The application addresses the complexity of command-line OpenVPN configuration and management by offering an intuitive interface for establishing, monitoring, and controlling VPN tunnels on Apple's desktop platform. Primary users include system administrators, IT professionals, and security-conscious individuals who need reliable VPN connectivity management on macOS systems. The project operates under GPL v2 licensing and focuses specifically on simplifying OpenVPN deployment and operation within the macOS ecosystem.
