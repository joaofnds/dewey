This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Unix/Linux dotfiles for system configuration and development environment setup, primarily targeting software developers and system administrators. The configuration spans multiple shells (zsh, bash, fish), editors (Neovim, Emacs, Vim), terminal multiplexers (tmux), window managers (i3), and development tools (Git, ripgrep, fzf). Built around NixOS with GNU Stow for symlink management, it includes configurations for terminal emulators (Alacritty), productivity tools (MPD, MPV, Mutt), macOS automation (Hammerspoon, Karabiner Elements), and various CLI utilities for text processing, file management, and system monitoring. The setup addresses the common problem of maintaining consistent, portable development environments across Unix-like systems, providing a battle-tested configuration suite for command-line-focused workflows in software development and system administration domains.
