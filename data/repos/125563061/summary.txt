Dust is a Rust-based command-line disk usage analyzer that serves as an enhanced replacement for the traditional Unix `du` command, targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who need efficient disk space analysis. Built entirely in Rust for performance and safety, it provides an intuitive visual interface with colored ASCII bars, hierarchical directory tree visualization, and intelligent recursion to identify large files and directories consuming disk space. The tool offers advanced filtering capabilities including regex-based file matching, filesystem boundary restrictions, symbolic link dereferencing, and JSON output for programmatic integration. Unlike traditional disk usage tools requiring complex flag combinations and post-processing with sort/head, Dust automatically displays the most relevant results with smart defaults, supporting multiple output formats, custom sorting options, and accessibility features for screen readers, making it particularly valuable for infrastructure monitoring and system maintenance workflows.
