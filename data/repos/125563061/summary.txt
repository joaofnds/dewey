`dust` is a command-line utility, written in Rust, designed to provide an intuitive and interactive disk usage analyzer, functioning as a more user-friendly alternative to the `du` command. It displays directory sizes with color-coded visual representations and offers features such as filtering by file type, excluding files/directories, reverse output, and displaying sizes in various formats. It's a standalone application targeting system administrators and developers who need a quick and informative overview of disk space consumption on Linux and macOS systems. The tool leverages Rust's performance characteristics, offering a more efficient and feature-rich solution compared to traditional disk usage tools.
