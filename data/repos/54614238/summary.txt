stdlib is a comprehensive JavaScript standard library designed for numerical and scientific computing in browsers and Node.js environments. Built with JavaScript and C, it provides over 150 special mathematical functions, 35+ probability distributions, 40+ pseudorandom number generators, BLAS linear algebra operations, statistical utilities, and data processing tools. The library features a fully decomposable modular architecture allowing selective imports, TypeScript declarations, native add-ons with JavaScript fallbacks, and supports bundling via Browserify/Webpack for web deployment. It targets data scientists, researchers, and developers performing mathematical computations, statistical analysis, and scientific computing tasks in JavaScript ecosystems, offering functionality comparable to Python's NumPy/SciPy or MATLAB for web-based numerical computing applications.
