Rand is a comprehensive Rust library for pseudo-random number generation built around the `rand_core::RngCore` trait, providing cryptographically secure (CSPRNGs) and basic PRNGs for systems programming and general software development. It offers multiple generator implementations including ChaCha, Xoshiro, and PCG algorithms, uniform and non-uniform distribution sampling, and random process utilities for shuffling and selection. The library supports `#[no_std]` environments, automatic seeding via the `getrandom` crate, and portably reproducible output across platforms. Targeting Rust developers building applications requiring random data generation, statistical sampling, cryptographic operations, or simulation workflows, Rand emphasizes performance optimization, correctness, and flexibility while maintaining compatibility across embedded systems and standard environments through configurable feature flags.
