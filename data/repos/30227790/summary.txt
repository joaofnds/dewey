`rand` is a Rust library providing (pseudo-)random number generation capabilities. It offers a standard RNG trait (`rand_core::RngCore`) with various fast implementations, including strong and small generators, and supports seeding from the `getrandom` crate.  Key functionalities include random value sampling with `StandardUniform` and `Uniform`, and random process traits for choosing and shuffling sequences, alongside support for diverse non-uniform distributions via `rand_distr` and `statrs`.  The library is designed for portability with `#[no_std]` compatibility and performance optimization, targeting Rust developers needing random number generation in their projects; it functions as a core library, offering a broad range of PRNG algorithms and utilities.
