mdBook is a command-line application written in Rust, designed to generate online books from Markdown files. Its primary functionality revolves around converting and structuring Markdown content into a navigable, web-based book format. The project provides features for compiling Markdown, likely including support for custom themes and content organization. As indicated by the `crates.io` badge and the Rust language tag, the project is a standalone application built using the Rust programming language and potentially leverages Rust's ecosystem for parsing and rendering. The project aims to be a developer productivity tool, particularly for creating technical documentation, guides, and similar long-form content.
