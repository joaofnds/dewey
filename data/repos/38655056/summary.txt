mdBook is a static site generator implemented in Rust that converts Markdown files into modern, searchable online books and documentation websites. Targeting the technical documentation and educational content domain, it serves developers, technical writers, and open-source maintainers who need to create comprehensive guides, API documentation, tutorials, and reference materials. The tool processes structured Markdown content with SUMMARY.md-based navigation, generates responsive HTML with built-in search functionality, syntax highlighting for code blocks, and customizable themes. mdBook addresses the problem of efficiently publishing and maintaining technical documentation by providing a GitBook-like experience with Rust's performance benefits, supporting integration with Git workflows and continuous deployment pipelines for documentation-as-code practices.
