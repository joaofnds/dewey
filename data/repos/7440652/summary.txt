JSCL is a Common Lisp to JavaScript compiler, bootstrapped from Common Lisp, enabling the execution of Lisp code in web browsers and NodeJS environments. It supports a subset of Common Lisp features, including multiple values, explicit control transfers (tagbody, go), static and dynamic non-local exits (catch, throw, block, return-from), lexical and special variables, optional and keyword arguments, SETF places, packages, the LOOP macro, and CLOS. This standalone application provides a `jscl-repl` in NodeJS and compiles into a `jscl.js` file, facilitating the execution of Lisp code within a JavaScript context.
