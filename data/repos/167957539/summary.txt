**procs** is a modern command-line replacement for the traditional Unix `ps` process monitoring utility, implemented in Rust for cross-platform system administration and DevOps workflows. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who need enhanced process visibility, it provides colored human-readable output with advanced features including multi-column keyword search, TCP/UDP port information, Docker container integration, memory throughput metrics, tree view visualization, and watch mode functionality. The tool leverages Rust's memory safety and performance characteristics to deliver a more intuitive process management experience across Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD systems, addressing the limitations of legacy process monitoring tools with modern terminal aesthetics, automatic theme detection, and extended process metadata not available in traditional `ps` implementations.
