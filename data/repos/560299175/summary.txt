Teable is a TypeScript-based, no-code application builder providing an alternative to Airtable, enabling users to create database-driven applications with a spreadsheet-like interface. It facilitates real-time collaboration and supports features like multiple view types (grid, Kanban, calendar), data aggregation, formula support, and plugins. The project's architecture comprises a Next.js frontend, a NestJS backend, and utilizes PostgreSQL and SQLite for data persistence, targeting both technical and non-technical users for internal tool development and data management. This is a standalone web application.
