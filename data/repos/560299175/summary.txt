Teable is a TypeScript-based no-code database application platform that provides an Airtable-like spreadsheet interface backed by PostgreSQL or SQLite databases. Built with Next.js frontend and NestJS backend, it targets business users and internal tool builders who need to create database applications without coding. The platform offers real-time collaboration, multiple data views (grid, kanban, calendar, form, gallery), formula support, aggregations, and can handle millions of rows with direct SQL query capabilities. It addresses the scalability and data portability limitations of traditional no-code platforms by using standard relational databases, allowing self-hosting and providing APIs for developers while maintaining an accessible spreadsheet-like interface for non-technical users building internal business applications.
