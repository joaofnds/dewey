This PHP-based GitHub Action facilitates the waiting and monitoring of commit statuses and checks within a GitHub workflow. Its core functionality is to pause execution until all status checks associated with a commit have passed or any have failed, signaling success or failure accordingly via an output. The action provides configurable options, including an interval for status polling and a mechanism to ignore specific actions, enabling integration within more complex CI/CD pipelines. Designed for use within GitHub Actions workflows, this is a developer productivity tool.
