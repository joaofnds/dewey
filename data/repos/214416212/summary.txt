This GitHub Action provides automated commit status synchronization for CI/CD pipelines by polling and waiting for all GitHub status checks and commit statuses to complete before proceeding with downstream workflow steps. Built for DevOps and software engineering teams using GitHub Actions workflows, it solves the coordination problem in complex CI pipelines where multiple parallel checks must complete successfully before triggering dependent actions like automated merging or deployments. The action implements configurable polling intervals, selective action filtering to prevent infinite loops, and outputs structured status results (success/failure/error/rate_limited) that can be consumed by subsequent workflow steps. Written in PHP, it integrates with GitHub's REST API and is commonly used in automated pull request workflows, release automation, and quality gate implementations where build orchestration requires waiting for external CI systems or multiple parallel job completion.
