Dura is a Rust-based background daemon that provides automated Git repository backup and recovery for software developers. It continuously monitors watched Git repositories and creates commits of uncommitted changes to separate tracking branches without affecting HEAD, working directory, or staged files, running on approximately 5-second intervals. Built using libgit2 for Git operations, it targets developers in any programming domain who need protection against work loss due to system crashes, accidental deletions, or editor failures. The tool addresses the limitation of traditional undo mechanisms by providing repository-wide snapshots that enable time-based recovery across entire codebases rather than individual files, offering a safety net for uncommitted development work without disrupting standard Git workflows or requiring changes to existing development practices.
