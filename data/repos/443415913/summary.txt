`Dura` is a standalone, command-line application designed to prevent data loss in Git repositories. It functions as a background process that automatically commits uncommitted changes without impacting the user's working branch or staged files. Implemented in Rust, it leverages Git functionalities to create and manage "dura" branches for continuous snapshotting. This tool provides a safety net for developers working with Git by enabling easy recovery to prior states of the repository and is targeted towards developers.
