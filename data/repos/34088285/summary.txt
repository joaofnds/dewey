libui is a cross-platform GUI library written in C that provides native-looking desktop applications by leveraging each platform's native GUI technologies rather than implementing custom rendering. Targeting desktop application developers who need portable GUI solutions, it abstracts platform-specific APIs (Windows API, Cocoa on macOS, GTK+ on Linux) behind a unified C interface. The library addresses the challenge of creating desktop applications that maintain native look-and-feel across Windows, macOS, and Linux without requiring separate platform-specific codebases. Currently in mid-alpha status, it supports basic UI controls like buttons, text fields, and tables, with a Meson-based build system. The primary use case is enabling C developers to build cross-platform desktop applications without dealing with platform-specific GUI programming complexities.
