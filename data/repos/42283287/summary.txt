Preact is a lightweight JavaScript library for building user interfaces in web development, serving as a React-compatible alternative with a significantly smaller footprint (3kB). It implements Virtual DOM rendering, component-based architecture, and supports modern React patterns including ES6 classes, functional components, and hooks. The library targets frontend developers who need React's API and functionality but require smaller bundle sizes for performance-critical applications. Preact supports JSX syntax, server-side rendering (SSR), hot module replacement (HMR), and provides React compatibility through a preact/compat alias. It addresses the problem of React's larger bundle size while maintaining API compatibility, making it ideal for mobile applications, progressive web apps, and projects where JavaScript payload size directly impacts user experience and performance metrics.
