Standard is an opinionated Ruby linter and formatter built on RuboCop that provides an "unconfigurable configuration" for Ruby code style enforcement. Targeting Ruby developers across web development, Rails applications, and general Ruby projects, it eliminates bikeshedding debates over code formatting rules by offering a fixed, non-customizable ruleset. The tool integrates RuboCop's core rules with rubocop-performance and supports plugins via lint_roller for framework-specific extensions like standard-rails and standard-sorbet. Standard addresses the common problem of teams spending excessive time debating linter configurations by providing a sensible default ruleset that automatically identifies style violations, performance issues, and potential errors while maintaining consistent code formatting across Ruby codebases without requiring developer consensus on styling preferences.
