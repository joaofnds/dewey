This repository contains the original Apollo 11 Guidance Computer (AGC) assembly source code for both the Command Module (Comanche055) and Lunar Module (Luminary099) flight software. The codebase represents NASA's mission-critical real-time embedded systems programming from 1969, digitized from MIT Museum hardcopy documentation by the Virtual AGC project. Written in AGC assembly language and compiled using the yaYUL assembler, this code controlled spacecraft navigation, guidance, and flight operations during the historic lunar landing mission. The repository serves aerospace engineers, computer historians, embedded systems developers, and researchers studying early spaceflight computing architecture. It addresses the preservation and accessibility of foundational aerospace software engineering artifacts, providing authentic source code from one of humanity's most complex early computing projects that operated under extreme reliability and resource constraints.
