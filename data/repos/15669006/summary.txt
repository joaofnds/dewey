`body-parser` is a Node.js middleware library for parsing incoming request bodies in Express.js applications. It provides middleware factories for parsing JSON, raw, text, and URL-encoded form data, making parsed body data accessible under the `req.body` property. Built for web application backends, it supports configurable options for controlling data size limits, character sets, and content type matching, alongside providing automated inflation for compressed bodies and error handling for various parse failures. This is a utility library for Node.js developers to enhance the functionality of their web applications with HTTP request body parsing capabilities.
