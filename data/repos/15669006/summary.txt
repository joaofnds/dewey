The body-parser repository is a Node.js middleware library specifically designed for Express.js web applications that handles HTTP request body parsing. It provides four specialized parsers for JSON, URL-encoded form data, raw buffer data, and plain text content types, automatically populating the `req.body` property with parsed data before route handlers execute. Built for web development backend services, it supports automatic decompression of gzip, brotli, and deflate encodings while offering configurable options for request size limits, content type filtering, and custom validation. The middleware targets Node.js backend developers building REST APIs and web applications who need reliable, secure parsing of incoming HTTP request payloads, with built-in protections against malformed data and explicit warnings about input validation requirements for production applications.
