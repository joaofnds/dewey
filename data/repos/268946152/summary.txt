`otpauth` is a standalone Go application designed to decode and convert Google Authenticator's `otpauth-migration` links into standard `otpauth` URIs. Functionality includes parsing migration links, generating QR codes for the converted URIs, and optionally serving the converted data via an HTTP server. It leverages the `protobuf` library for data handling and provides a CLI interface with flags for various operations, including evaluation of OTPs and output formatting. This developer productivity tool targets users who need to migrate Google Authenticator accounts.
