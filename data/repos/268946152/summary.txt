This Go-based CLI tool serves the cybersecurity and authentication domain by decoding Google Authenticator migration data for TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) management. It parses `otpauth-migration://` URIs exported from Google Authenticator apps and converts the embedded Protocol Buffer data into standard `otpauth://` links compatible with other authenticator applications. The tool targets security professionals, developers, and system administrators who need to migrate or backup two-factor authentication configurations across different platforms. Key features include QR code generation, HTTP server mode for web-based access, OTP evaluation, and Protocol Buffer inspection capabilities. Built with Go and leveraging protobuf serialization, it addresses the practical problem of vendor lock-in in 2FA systems by enabling seamless migration between authenticator applications while maintaining security compliance.
