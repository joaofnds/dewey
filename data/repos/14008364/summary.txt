**jinzhu/copier** is a Go library that provides automated struct-to-struct data copying functionality for backend Go applications. It enables developers to copy fields between structs, slices, and maps based on name matching, supporting method-to-field copying and complex nested structures. The library offers granular control through struct tags including `copier:"must"` for mandatory field copying, `copier:"override"` for ignoring empty checks, and `copier:"-"` for field exclusion. Designed for web development, API services, and data transformation pipelines, it solves the repetitive boilerplate problem of manually mapping data between domain models, DTOs, and database entities. The library supports deep copying, type conversion between compatible types, and handles complex scenarios like copying from single structs to slices, making it valuable for Go backend developers working with layered architectures requiring frequent data model transformations.
