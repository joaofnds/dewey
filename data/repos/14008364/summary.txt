`jinzhu/copier` is a Go library providing a flexible and feature-rich solution for copying data between Go structs, supporting field-to-field copying and method-to-field value transfer. It facilitates data manipulation through tag-based configurations, including field exclusion, forced copying, and value overriding, alongside advanced features like struct-to-slice and map-to-map copying. The library leverages Go's reflection capabilities, offering capabilities to handle complex data structures including nested structs with slices. As a developer productivity tool, it is a utility package designed to streamline data transformation operations for Go developers.
