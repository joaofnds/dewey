lisp-unit is a unit testing framework for Common Lisp applications, designed as a JUnit-inspired testing library for the Lisp development ecosystem. The framework targets Common Lisp developers and software engineers working in functional programming environments who need robust test automation capabilities. It provides comprehensive testing functionality including assertion testing for return values, printed output validation, macro expansion testing, and condition handling verification. The library supports modular test organization through package-based grouping and tagging systems, integrates with standard Lisp build tools (ASDF, Quicklisp), and offers multiple output formats including Test Anything Protocol (TAP) compliance. Key technical features include floating-point predicates for numerical testing, fine-grained output control, and a database-backed result storage system that enables detailed test result analysis and reporting.
