`lisp-unit` is a Common Lisp library providing a unit testing framework, inspired by JUnit. It enables developers to define and execute tests for Common Lisp code, supporting features like testing return values, printed output, macro expansions, and conditions. The library offers output control, result storage in a database object, test grouping by package and tags, and optional integration with the Test Anything Protocol (TAP). Functionality includes loading via a single file or with ASDF and Quicklisp, and the project aims to improve IDE integration.
