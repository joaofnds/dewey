The Common Lisp Cookbook is a Jekyll-based static documentation site providing practical programming examples and tutorials for Common Lisp development. Built using Ruby/Jekyll with Docker containerization support, it serves as a comprehensive reference for Common Lisp developers ranging from beginners to advanced practitioners. The repository includes automated build processes for generating EPUB and PDF formats using Calibre, with content management through Markdown files and YAML frontmatter. It addresses the gap in modern Common Lisp documentation by offering cookbook-style solutions for common programming tasks, complementing theoretical resources like the HyperSpec and Practical Common Lisp. The project targets Lisp programmers seeking practical implementation guidance and code examples for everyday development challenges in the Common Lisp ecosystem.
