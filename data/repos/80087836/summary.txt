`Badger` is a high-performance, embeddable key-value (KV) database written in Go, optimized for SSDs and designed for concurrent ACID transactions. Functionality includes support for snapshots, TTL, and versioning, making it suitable for datasets spanning terabytes. As a library, it provides a fast, persistent storage solution, employed by projects like Dgraph and Jaeger, and offers a command-line tool for offline operations. The architecture is based on the WiscKey paper and utilizes an LSM tree design with a value log.
