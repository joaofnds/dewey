BadgerDB is an embeddable, persistent key-value database written in pure Go, designed as a high-performance alternative to RocksDB for Go applications. Built on LSM tree architecture with value log separation optimized for SSDs, it provides ACID transactions with serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) guarantees and concurrent access capabilities. The database targets backend developers and system architects building data-intensive applications, distributed systems, and graph databases, serving as the underlying storage engine for projects like Dgraph, Jaeger Tracing, and other Go-based services requiring fast key-value operations on terabyte-scale datasets. It addresses the need for a pure Go database solution that eliminates CGO dependencies while delivering enterprise-grade performance and reliability.
