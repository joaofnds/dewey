Difftastic is a structural diff tool built in Rust that performs syntax-aware file comparison using Tree-sitter parsers to understand code structure rather than just textual differences. It targets software developers across multiple programming domains, supporting over 30 languages including JavaScript, Python, C++, and others. Unlike traditional line-based diff tools, it parses source code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to intelligently align semantically equivalent code blocks, handle whitespace changes contextually, and understand language-specific tokenization rules. The tool integrates with Git and Mercurial workflows, making it particularly valuable for code review, version control operations, and merge conflict resolution in software development environments where understanding structural code changes is more important than simple textual modifications.
