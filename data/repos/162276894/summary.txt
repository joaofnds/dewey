`difftastic` is a command-line tool, written in Rust, providing a structural diff functionality that compares files based on their syntax, supporting over 30 programming languages via tree-sitter parsers. It highlights syntactic differences, understands nesting and alignment within code structures, and can handle merge conflicts and check for syntactic changes. This standalone application is designed for developer productivity, primarily used for comparing source code and integrating with version control systems like Git and Mercurial.
