This repository provides a Shell script-based Docker Compose project designed to quickly deploy a sharded MongoDB cluster on a local workstation. It leverages Docker containers to create and manage an 11-container cluster, including `mongod` instances for shards and config servers, along with `mongos` routers. Users can build, run, and interact with the sharded MongoDB cluster directly from their workstation using the MongoDB Shell or Compass, accessing the cluster through forwarded ports. This is an example/template project and developer productivity tool aimed at simplifying local MongoDB sharded cluster setup for development and testing.
