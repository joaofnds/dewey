This repository provides a Docker Compose-based solution for deploying a complete MongoDB sharded cluster locally for development and testing purposes. Targeting DevOps engineers, database administrators, and backend developers, it automates the orchestration of 11 containerized MongoDB components: 6 mongod processes across 2 shard replica sets, 3 mongod processes for the configdb replica set, and 2 mongos router processes. The solution addresses the complexity of manually configuring MongoDB sharding infrastructure by providing single-command deployment via Docker Compose, enabling developers to quickly spin up a production-like sharded database environment on their workstations. Key technologies include Docker containers, MongoDB sharding architecture, replica sets, and shell scripting, with the cluster accessible through localhost ports 27017/27018 for application development and testing against distributed MongoDB deployments.
