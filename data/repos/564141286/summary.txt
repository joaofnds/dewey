This browser extension operates in the social media domain, specifically targeting Twitter/X platform functionality to differentiate between legacy verified accounts and paid Twitter Blue subscribers. Built with JavaScript and cross-browser web extension APIs, it implements content script injection to modify Twitter's DOM and visual indicators in real-time. The extension addresses the user verification confusion that emerged after Twitter's monetization of the blue checkmark system, providing visual distinction between historically verified accounts and paid subscribers. It's distributed across multiple browser extension stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons, Microsoft Edge Add-ons) using standard WebExtension manifest architecture. The target users are general Twitter users and social media consumers who need to quickly identify account verification status for credibility assessment, rather than developers or technical professionals.
