Hadolint is a static analysis tool for the DevOps and containerization domain that lints Dockerfiles to enforce best practices and catch configuration errors. Written in Haskell, it parses Dockerfiles into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and applies rule-based validation, while integrating with ShellCheck to lint embedded Bash code within RUN instructions. The tool targets DevOps engineers, container developers, and system administrators who need to maintain high-quality Docker images by validating container build configurations against established Docker best practices. Hadolint supports multiple output formats, custom rule configuration, trusted registry validation, and provides both CLI and web-based interfaces, making it essential tooling for CI/CD pipelines and container security workflows in modern software deployment practices.
