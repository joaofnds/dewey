`hadolint` is a static analysis tool and Dockerfile linter, written in Haskell, designed to enforce best practices for building Docker images. It parses Dockerfiles into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and applies a set of rules to validate instructions and lint inline Bash code via ShellCheck. The command-line application provides features such as rule configuration, ignore pragmas, and integration with CI/CD pipelines, targeting developers who build and manage Docker container images. It analyzes Dockerfiles for common errors, security vulnerabilities, and stylistic issues, helping to improve image quality and reduce build errors.
