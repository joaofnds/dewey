Transfer.sh is a Go-based HTTP file sharing service designed for command-line file distribution and temporary storage. Built for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and developers, it provides a REST API server that enables quick file uploads/downloads via curl commands without requiring authentication or web interfaces. The service supports multiple storage backends including Amazon S3, Google Drive, Storj, and local filesystem, with features like automatic file expiration, download limits, server-side AES256 encryption, and VirusTotal integration. It addresses the need for ephemeral file sharing in CI/CD pipelines, remote server administration, and quick file transfers between systems, offering a self-hostable alternative to traditional file sharing services with Docker deployment capabilities.
