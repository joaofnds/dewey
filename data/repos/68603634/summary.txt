re-frisk is a debugging and development tool specifically designed for re-frame applications in the Clojure/ClojureScript ecosystem. It provides comprehensive introspection capabilities for re-frame's reactive state management, enabling developers to monitor app-db state changes, track event dispatching, visualize subscription dependencies, and analyze component rendering patterns. The tool supports both embedded web debugging and remote debugging via WebSocket connections for React Native and Electron applications. Key features include real-time state inspection, event timeline visualization, subscription graphs, and re-frame handler performance statistics. Built with Reagent and targeting ClojureScript developers, re-frisk addresses the complex debugging challenges inherent in reactive functional programming architectures by providing deep visibility into re-frame's event-driven state management flow, subscription recalculations, and component lifecycle events.
