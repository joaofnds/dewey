`re-frisk` is a Clojure and ClojureScript developer tool for debugging and inspecting [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) applications. It provides real-time visualizations of application state, including app-db contents, subscription values, event history with diffs, and event timelines. The tool offers features such as key watching, event tracing, subscription and view analysis, and handler statistics visualization. Functionality is delivered via a library that can be embedded directly or utilized remotely (for React Native, Electron, and web applications), leveraging Clojure and ClojureScript with potential integration with React. This is a developer productivity tool/library for frontend developers using re-frame.
