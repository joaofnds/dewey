Postgres-WASM is a proof-of-concept implementation that runs a complete PostgreSQL database server inside web browsers using WebAssembly and x86 emulation. Built primarily with Shell scripts, it leverages the v86 JavaScript emulator to run a Buildroot Linux environment containing PostgreSQL, enabling client-side database operations without server infrastructure. The project targets web developers and database engineers working on browser-based applications, prototyping, or educational platforms who need local PostgreSQL instances for development, testing, or demonstrations. It solves the problem of requiring server-side database infrastructure for PostgreSQL-dependent applications by providing a fully functional database engine that runs entirely in the browser environment, though the maintainers now recommend more mature alternatives like PGlite for production use cases.
