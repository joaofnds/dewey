`postgres-wasm` is a proof-of-concept project enabling a PostgreSQL server instance to run within a web browser environment. It leverages the v86 x86 emulator to execute a buildroot image containing PostgreSQL. Key functionalities include running a full PostgreSQL database server accessible in a browser, facilitating local database development and experimentation. The project comprises `runtime`, `buildroot`, and `websockproxy` packages written with shell scripts, utilizing v86 for emulation and websockproxy for networking. This is an example project demonstrating the feasibility of running a database server entirely within a browser.
