**Project Limbo** is a modern evolution of SQLite, an embedded database engine library written in Rust. It offers SQLite compatibility for SQL dialect, file formats, and the C API, with core features including asynchronous I/O support on Linux, language bindings for JavaScript/WebAssembly, Rust, Go, Python, and OS support for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The project aims to integrate vector search for embeddings and vector similarity, improve write throughput with `BEGIN CONCURRENT`, and enhance schema management. This library is suitable for developers working on web applications, machine learning projects, or systems requiring an embedded database solution.
