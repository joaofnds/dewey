Limbo is a Rust-based rewrite of SQLite designed as a modern embedded OLTP database engine for application developers and database-driven software systems. Built with asynchronous I/O support using io_uring on Linux, it maintains SQLite compatibility for SQL dialect, file formats, and C API while targeting web development, serverless computing, and embedded database use cases. The project provides language bindings for JavaScript/WebAssembly, Python, Go, and Java, enabling cross-platform deployment across Linux, macOS, and Windows. Limbo addresses performance limitations of traditional SQLite through native async operations and modern Rust concurrency primitives, targeting developers building data-intensive applications, serverless functions, and embedded systems requiring lightweight, high-performance database capabilities with improved write throughput and integrated vector search functionality.
