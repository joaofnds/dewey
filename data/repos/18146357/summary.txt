ace-window is an Emacs Lisp package that enhances window management within the Emacs text editor environment. It addresses the inefficiency of Emacs' built-in `other-window` command when dealing with multiple windows by providing predictable, single-keystroke window selection through visual overlays. The package displays numbered or lettered labels on each window, allowing users to jump directly to their target window instead of cycling through them sequentially. It supports advanced window operations including swapping, deleting, splitting, and moving windows across multiple frames, with customizable key bindings and display options. Targeted at Emacs users and developers who work with complex multi-window layouts, ace-window integrates seamlessly with existing Emacs workflows while significantly improving navigation efficiency in text editing and development environments.
