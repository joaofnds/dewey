`ace-window` is an Emacs Lisp package designed to expedite window navigation within the Emacs text editor. It provides an efficient window switching mechanism by assigning short key bindings that activate visual cues within each window, allowing users to quickly select the desired window via character input, similar to `ace-jump-mode`. Key functionalities include window swapping, deletion, splitting, and buffer selection, alongside extensive customization options for key bindings, scope (global or frame-specific), and background behavior. This project functions as an Emacs extension, targeting Emacs users seeking enhanced keyboard-driven window management for improved productivity.
