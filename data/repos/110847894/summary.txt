Taskell is a command-line Kanban board and task management application built in Haskell, targeting software developers and project managers who prefer terminal-based workflows. The tool provides a TUI (Terminal User Interface) for managing project tasks using Vim-style keybindings, with data persistence through Markdown files that enable clean version control diffs. Core functionality includes local task board management, Trello board imports via REST API integration, and GitHub project imports for development workflow integration. The application addresses the need for lightweight, keyboard-driven project management without GUI dependencies, particularly suited for developers working in terminal-heavy environments. Key technical features include ncurses-based interface rendering, cross-platform support (macOS/Linux), configurable theming, sub-task hierarchies, due date tracking, and multi-column board layouts stored as structured Markdown for easy portability and version control integration.
