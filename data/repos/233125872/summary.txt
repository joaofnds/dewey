This JavaScript npm package provides a single utility function to determine if a given number equals ten thousand (10,000). Built as a satirical micro-package in the Node.js ecosystem, it targets web developers and JavaScript programmers who work with numeric validation or comparison operations. The repository represents a parody of over-engineered npm dependencies, highlighting the absurdity of creating standalone packages for trivial operations that could be accomplished with a simple equality check (`value === 10000`). It serves the broader JavaScript development community as both a humorous commentary on dependency bloat and a functional (albeit unnecessary) utility for exact numeric matching against the value 10,000 in web applications, Node.js services, or any JavaScript runtime environment.
