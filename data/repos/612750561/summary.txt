SQL Translator is a web application that translates natural language queries into SQL code and vice versa, facilitating data interaction for users without SQL expertise. Built with TypeScript, it leverages OpenAI's API for AI-powered translation, offering features like SQL syntax highlighting, dark mode, query history, and schema awareness. The project is a standalone web application, enabling users to input either natural language or SQL and receive the corresponding output. It targets users needing to query relational databases without direct SQL knowledge.
