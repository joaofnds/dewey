SQL Translator is a TypeScript-based web application that provides bidirectional conversion between natural language queries and SQL code using OpenAI's language models. Targeting the data science and data engineering domains, it addresses the accessibility barrier between non-technical users and database querying by enabling natural language-to-SQL translation and vice versa. The tool features SQL syntax highlighting, schema awareness, query history, and supports PostgreSQL databases. Built for data analysts, business users, and developers who need to bridge the gap between business requirements expressed in natural language and executable SQL queries, it eliminates the need for deep SQL expertise when working with relational databases for data analysis and reporting tasks.
