Compton is a lightweight X11 compositor written in C that provides desktop visual effects and window compositing for Linux/Unix systems. It's a fork of xcompmgr-dana targeting system administrators, window manager developers, and Linux desktop users who need hardware-accelerated window rendering. The compositor implements OpenGL and X Render backends, supporting features like window transparency, shadows, blur effects, VSync, and fade animations. Built using Xlib and OpenGL, it integrates with X11 libraries (libxcomposite, libxdamage, libxfixes, libxrender) to manage window composition and visual effects. Compton solves the need for standalone, configurable desktop compositing without the overhead of full desktop environments, making it popular among users of lightweight window managers like i3, Openbox, and dwm who want modern visual effects.
