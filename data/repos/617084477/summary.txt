This TypeScript plugin extends ObsidianMD, a note-taking application, by integrating a code editor based on the Monaco Editor, enabling users to view and edit code files directly within their notes. The plugin provides capabilities for creating new code files, supports syntax highlighting, theme customization, and allows editing of individual code blocks within Markdown files, along with editing CSS snippets. It is implemented as an Obsidian plugin and relies on hosted dependencies for the Monaco Editor, requiring an active internet connection. The primary domain is developer productivity within the context of a note-taking application.
