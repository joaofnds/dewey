This repository provides a comprehensive style guide for writing RSpec tests in Ruby applications, establishing standardized best practices for test code organization, formatting, and structure. Targeted at Ruby developers and development teams working on Rails applications and Ruby gems, it defines conventions for layout, naming, example group organization, test structure, and matcher usage within the RSpec testing framework. The guide addresses common maintainability issues in test suites by providing specific rules for spacing, grouping of `let` blocks, `describe`/`context` nesting, and expectation writing patterns. It integrates with RuboCop's static analysis ecosystem through the `rubocop-rspec` extension, enabling automated enforcement of these style conventions in continuous integration pipelines. The resource serves as a community-driven standard for Ruby testing practices, helping development teams write more readable, maintainable, and consistent RSpec test suites across projects.
