JSR is an open-source JavaScript/TypeScript package registry implemented in Rust, serving as an alternative to npm for modern JavaScript development. The system uses a cloud-native architecture with Google Cloud Storage for module and npm compatibility tarball storage, PostgreSQL for metadata, and Google Cloud Run for API and frontend hosting across multiple regions. The frontend is built with Fresh (Deno's web framework) while the management API is written in Rust, providing package publishing, discovery, and distribution capabilities. It addresses the need for a robust, low-maintenance package registry specifically optimized for TypeScript and modern JavaScript workflows, targeting JavaScript/TypeScript developers who require reliable dependency management and package distribution infrastructure.
