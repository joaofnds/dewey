**Netty Project** - an event-driven asynchronous network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high-performance protocol servers and clients in Java. This library focuses on solving network I/O challenges by providing a flexible, extensible architecture that supports various transport layers (TCP, UDP, TLS) and protocols (HTTP, WebSocket). Core features include non-blocking I/O operations, channel pipelines for request/response handling, and customizable event-driven programming models. The project leverages Apache Maven for build automation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Target users are developers building high-performance network applications in Java.
