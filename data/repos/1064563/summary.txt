Netty is a high-performance, asynchronous event-driven network application framework written in Java designed for building scalable protocol servers and clients. It targets backend/server-side development, distributed systems, and network programming domains where developers need to implement custom network protocols or build high-throughput network services. The framework abstracts complex NIO (Non-blocking I/O) operations and provides a unified API for various transport protocols including TCP, UDP, and native transports on Linux/MacOS. Netty solves the complexity of low-level network programming by offering an event-driven architecture with channel pipelines, codecs, and handlers for protocol implementation. It's primarily used by Java developers building microservices, message brokers, web servers, game servers, and other network-intensive applications requiring high concurrency and low latency performance characteristics.
