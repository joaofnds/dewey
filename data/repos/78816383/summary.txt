Cookie AutoDelete is a browser extension, primarily for Firefox and Chrome, written in TypeScript, designed to automatically delete cookies and other site data when tabs are closed, domains change, or the browser restarts, thereby enhancing user privacy. The extension provides features such as cookie whitelisting/greylisting, allowing users to control which cookies are retained, and includes options for manual cleaning via a popup interface. It supports Container Tabs in Firefox and offers import/export functionality for configurations. This project is a browser web extension for improving user privacy and targets end-users of Firefox and Chrome browsers.
