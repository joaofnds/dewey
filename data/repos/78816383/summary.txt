Cookie AutoDelete is a cross-browser WebExtension written in TypeScript that provides automated cookie and browsing data management for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. The extension implements privacy-focused browsing by automatically deleting cookies when tabs close, domains change, or browsers restart, while supporting whitelist/greylist functionality for selective cookie retention. It targets privacy-conscious end users and web developers who need granular control over cookie persistence and tracking prevention. The extension leverages WebExtension APIs for browser integration, supports Firefox Container Tabs, and includes features for cookie import/export, manual cleaning modes, and real-time cookie monitoring. It addresses the web privacy domain by solving automatic tracking cookie cleanup while preserving user-approved site data.
