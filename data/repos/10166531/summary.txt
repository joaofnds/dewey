`mitchellh/mapstructure` is a Go library designed for decoding generic map values (specifically `map[string]interface{}`) into native Go structures and vice versa, facilitating flexible data deserialization. It provides robust error handling and is particularly useful when the structure of the incoming data is not known beforehand, such as when decoding from JSON or other data streams. This library offers a way to dynamically decode data into appropriate Go structs, bypassing the need for pre-defined struct representations in certain decoding scenarios. It is a developer productivity library for Go, intended to simplify data handling tasks.
