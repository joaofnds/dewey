mapstructure is a Go library that provides bidirectional conversion between generic map[string]interface{} structures and native Go structs with comprehensive error handling. It primarily serves backend developers and configuration management systems in web development and distributed systems domains where dynamic data structure handling is required. The library addresses the common problem of decoding partially unknown data structures from JSON, YAML, or other serialization formats where the target struct type must be determined at runtime based on discriminator fields. It's particularly valuable for configuration parsers, API gateways, and microservices that need to handle polymorphic data structures or implement flexible schema-less data processing pipelines without requiring multiple parsing passes or complex reflection-based solutions.
