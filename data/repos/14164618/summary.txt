Tree-sitter is a parser generator and incremental parsing library, designed for programming tools. It constructs concrete syntax trees for source files and efficiently updates them with edits. Written in Rust with a pure C runtime, it provides a dependency-free, performant solution suitable for use in text editors and other applications requiring robust parsing, including WASM bindings for web environments. This library focuses on general-purpose, fast, and error-tolerant parsing for a variety of programming languages, serving as a core component for developer productivity tools.
