Tree-sitter is an incremental parsing system and parser generator designed for programming language tooling and development environments. Built with a C runtime core and Rust implementation, it generates concrete syntax trees from source code and efficiently updates them during live editing sessions. The system targets IDE developers, text editor maintainers, and language tooling creators who need real-time parsing capabilities that handle syntax errors gracefully. Tree-sitter supports multiple language bindings including Rust, WebAssembly, and provides a command-line interface for parser generation. Its primary use case addresses the performance bottleneck in code editors and language servers that require fast, keystroke-level parsing for features like syntax highlighting, code folding, and error detection across arbitrary programming languages.
