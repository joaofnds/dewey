TypeScript is a statically-typed programming language that extends JavaScript with optional type annotations and compiles to plain JavaScript. Targeting web development and application-scale JavaScript projects, it provides a comprehensive type system, type checker, and transpiler to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. The repository contains the core TypeScript compiler (tsc), language service APIs, and type inference engine that supports modern JavaScript features while enabling enhanced IDE tooling, refactoring capabilities, and code intelligence. Designed for JavaScript developers working on large-scale applications across browsers, Node.js, and other JavaScript runtimes, TypeScript addresses the challenges of maintaining and scaling complex JavaScript codebases through static type analysis and improved developer experience.
