This repository provides a comprehensive user-level `deps.edn` configuration for the Clojure CLI toolchain with predefined aliases that streamline Clojure development workflows. It targets Clojure developers working on deps.edn-based projects by offering ready-to-use aliases for common tasks including REPL startup with rebel-readline, ClojureScript development, test execution, dependency management, library searching, and project creation. The configuration includes integrations with development tools like clj-kondo for linting, cljstyle for code formatting, and various community libraries for enhanced REPL experiences and project scaffolding. It addresses the problem of repetitive tooling setup across Clojure projects by providing a standardized, shareable configuration that enables a "REPL Reloaded" development workflow, eliminating the need for developers to manually configure common development aliases in each project.
