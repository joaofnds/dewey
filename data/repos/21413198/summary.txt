Immutable.js is a TypeScript-based JavaScript library that provides persistent immutable data structures for web application development. It implements efficient collections like List, Map, Set, Stack, and Record using structural sharing via hash array mapped tries and vector tries, techniques borrowed from functional programming languages like Clojure and Scala. The library solves JavaScript's mutable data problems by offering immutable alternatives that enable safer state management, simplified debugging, and optimized change detection in modern web applications, particularly React-based SPAs. It targets JavaScript/TypeScript developers building complex frontend applications who need predictable data flow, enhanced performance through structural sharing, and reduced bugs from unintended mutations. The library includes lazy evaluation through Seq collections and batching capabilities for efficient bulk operations.
