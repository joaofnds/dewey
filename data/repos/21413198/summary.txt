`immutable-js/immutable-js` is a TypeScript library providing persistent, immutable data collections for JavaScript, enhancing efficiency and simplifying application development. It offers immutable data structures like `List`, `Map`, `Set`, and `Seq`, optimized for modern JavaScript VMs through structural sharing techniques. The library's API mirrors ES2015's and integrates with JavaScript objects, enabling value-based equality comparisons and efficient batching of mutations. Primarily designed for front-end developers, it is a library enabling predictable state management and is particularly well-suited for use with frameworks such as React and Flux.
