**mal** (Make a Lisp) is an educational programming language implementation project that provides a step-by-step guide for building Clojure-inspired Lisp interpreters across 89+ programming languages including C, Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go, and WebAssembly. The repository contains 11 incremental implementation steps covering core interpreter concepts like REPL construction, parsing, evaluation, environments, control flow, tail call optimization, macros, and self-hosting capabilities. Designed for computer science education and language learning, mal serves developers, students, and programming language enthusiasts who want to understand interpreter design and implementation principles. Each language implementation follows identical architectural patterns, making it a comprehensive resource for comparative programming language study and compiler construction pedagogy.
