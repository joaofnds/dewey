Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server implementation written in Go that provides SSH-based repository management and browsing capabilities for DevOps and development teams. It serves as an alternative to GitHub/GitLab for organizations requiring on-premises Git hosting, offering SSH authentication via public keys, Git LFS support, and a terminal-based user interface accessible over SSH connections. The system supports standard Git operations (clone, push, pull) over SSH, HTTP, and Git protocols, while providing repository access control, user management, and administrative functions through command-line interfaces. Target users include system administrators, DevOps engineers, and development teams needing lightweight, self-managed Git infrastructure with terminal-native workflows and SSH-first authentication mechanisms.
