This JavaScript library provides string similarity comparison functionality, leveraging Dice's Coefficient to determine the degree of resemblance between two strings, often outperforming Levenshtein distance. Core functionalities include `compareTwoStrings`, returning a similarity score between 0 and 1, and `findBestMatch`, identifying the most similar string from a provided array. Designed for use in both Node.js and browser environments, the library is available as a UMD build, and its API provides convenient string comparison utilities. The primary project type is a JavaScript library intended for developers requiring string comparison capabilities within their applications.
