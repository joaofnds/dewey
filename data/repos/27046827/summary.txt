This JavaScript library implements string similarity comparison using Dice's Coefficient algorithm, providing a more accurate alternative to Levenshtein distance for measuring textual similarity. Built for web development environments, it offers both Node.js and browser compatibility through UMD packaging. The library exposes two core functions: `compareTwoStrings()` for pairwise comparison returning similarity scores from 0-1, and `findBestMatch()` for comparing one string against multiple candidates with ranked results. Primary use cases include fuzzy string matching, search functionality, duplicate detection, and text analysis in web applications. The O(n) performance optimization makes it suitable for real-time applications requiring efficient string comparison operations, targeting JavaScript developers working on search engines, data deduplication systems, or content management platforms.
