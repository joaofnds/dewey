Metabase is an open-source business intelligence and analytics platform built primarily in Clojure that enables organizations to visualize, analyze, and share data insights. It targets the business intelligence domain, providing a web-based interface for creating interactive dashboards, SQL queries, and data visualizations without requiring technical expertise. The platform supports multiple database backends including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others through driver architecture, while offering features like embedded analytics, automated reporting, dashboard subscriptions, and API integration. Built with a Clojure backend and JavaScript frontend, Metabase serves both technical users (data analysts, developers) and business users who need self-service analytics capabilities, addressing the gap between raw data storage and accessible business intelligence reporting.
