Traefik is a cloud-native HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer written in Go, designed for dynamic microservices environments. It targets DevOps and infrastructure teams managing containerized applications across Docker, Kubernetes, ECS, and service discovery platforms like Consul and Etcd. The system automatically discovers services through orchestrator APIs and dynamically generates routing configurations without manual intervention, eliminating the need for static configuration management. Key technical features include automatic HTTPS certificate provisioning via Let's Encrypt, multiple load balancing algorithms, circuit breakers, WebSocket/HTTP/2/gRPC support, and comprehensive metrics integration with Prometheus, Datadog, and InfluxDB. Traefik solves the operational complexity of routing traffic to ephemeral microservices in dynamic container orchestration environments, primarily serving platform engineers and SREs managing cloud-native infrastructure.
