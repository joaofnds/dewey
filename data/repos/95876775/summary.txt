This repository provides a comprehensive set of JavaScript project best practices and development guidelines targeting web developers and JavaScript engineers. It covers essential software engineering practices including Git workflow management with feature-branch strategies, code style enforcement through linting tools, testing methodologies, project structure conventions, API design principles, and development environment consistency. The guidelines address common maintainability challenges in JavaScript projects by establishing standards for commit messaging, dependency management, documentation practices, logging, and security considerations. Designed for development teams and individual JavaScript developers, it serves as a practical reference for establishing coding standards, improving code quality, and ensuring long-term project maintainability across Node.js and browser-based JavaScript applications.
