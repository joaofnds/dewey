**vim-enfocado** is a Vim/Neovim colorscheme implementation that provides syntax highlighting themes for code editors, targeting software developers across all programming domains. Built using Vim Script, it implements the Selenized color palette based on CIELAB color space theory and integrates with popular Vim ecosystem plugins including Lightline, Lualine, Airline statuslines, nvim-treesitter, LSP configurations, and various Neovim plugins like Telescope and Neo-tree. The theme addresses developer productivity by applying color theory principles with minimal three-color syntax highlighting, italic typeface for human-readable code elements, and reserved signal colors (red/yellow/orange) for alerts and errors. It offers nature and neon style variants with both light and dark modes, supporting true color terminals and providing customizable plugin-specific highlighting for modern Vim-based development environments.
