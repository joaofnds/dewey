AeroSpace is a tiling window manager for macOS written in Swift, specifically designed to replicate the i3 window manager experience on Apple systems. Targeting power users, developers, and system administrators who prefer keyboard-driven workflow management, it implements a tree-based window arrangement paradigm with virtual workspace emulation that bypasses macOS Spaces limitations. The application provides CLI-first interaction with shell completion and manpages, TOML-based configuration for dotfiles integration, and multi-monitor support following i3 conventions. Unlike traditional macOS window managers, AeroSpace operates without requiring System Integrity Protection (SIP) disabling and offers fast workspace switching without animations, addressing the productivity needs of users transitioning from Linux i3wm environments to macOS while maintaining familiar tiling behavior and keyboard shortcuts.
