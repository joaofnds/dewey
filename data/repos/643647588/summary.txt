AeroSpace is a standalone tiling window manager application for macOS, designed to provide an i3-like experience. Written in Swift, it emulates virtual workspaces and offers plain text configuration compatible with dotfiles. Key features include fast workspace switching without animations, proper multi-monitor support, and a CLI-first interface with man pages and shell completion. The project targets advanced macOS users and developers seeking a keyboard-centric, customizable tiling window management solution, prioritizing practicality and avoiding reliance on macOS's native Spaces functionality.
