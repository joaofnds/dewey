DuckDB-Wasm is a WebAssembly port of DuckDB, an in-process SQL OLAP database management system, designed to bring analytical database capabilities directly to web browsers and Node.js environments. Built with TypeScript and WebAssembly, it targets data analysts, web developers, and data scientists who need to perform SQL-based analytics on structured data (Parquet, CSV, JSON) in client-side applications without server dependencies. The repository provides a complete JavaScript/TypeScript API, React hooks, and a web-based SQL shell, enabling columnar data processing, OLAP operations, and Arrow-format data manipulation within browser sandboxes. It solves the challenge of running high-performance analytical queries on large datasets in web applications while maintaining compatibility with the full DuckDB ecosystem, including spatial extensions and community plugins for advanced data analysis workflows.
