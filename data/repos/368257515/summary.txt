DuckDB-Wasm is a WebAssembly adaptation of the DuckDB in-process SQL OLAP database management system, enabling in-browser and Node.js analytics. Built with TypeScript and C++, it provides a fully functional SQL database accessible in web environments, offering SQL query execution, support for file formats like Parquet, CSV, and JSON, and compatibility with DuckDB database files. Key features include support for SQL extensions, single-threaded and experimental multithreaded execution, and integrations with Filesystem APIs and HTTP requests. This project is a JavaScript library and a standalone web application that targets developers needing SQL database functionality within web applications or server-side JavaScript environments.
