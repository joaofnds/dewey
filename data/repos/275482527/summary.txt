AnnePro2-Tools is a Rust-based firmware flashing utility specifically designed for the Anne Pro 2 mechanical keyboard, targeting the embedded systems and hardware hacking domain. The tool provides an alternative to official firmware update mechanisms, enabling users to flash custom firmware binaries directly to the keyboard's main MCU via USB communication. It operates by interfacing with the keyboard in IAP (In-Application Programming) mode, automatically detecting the device at USB ID 04d9:8008 and flashing firmware starting at memory address 0x4000. This tool primarily serves hardware enthusiasts, keyboard modders, and embedded developers who want to customize their Anne Pro 2's functionality beyond manufacturer limitations, facilitating the installation of community-developed or personally modified firmware for enhanced keyboard features and behaviors.
