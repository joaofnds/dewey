PipeWire is a C-based multimedia framework and daemon providing a server-side API for handling audio and video pipelines. It enables source multiplexing, consumption, and processing of multimedia streams, functioning as a backend for ALSA, JACK, and PulseAudio. The project offers command-line tools (e.g., `pw-cat`, `pw-play`) and GStreamer elements for audio/video manipulation, along with GUI tools like Helvum for graph inspection. This framework primarily caters to users and developers seeking a unified multimedia handling solution, particularly those working with audio applications, video compositors, or multimedia device integration on Linux systems.
