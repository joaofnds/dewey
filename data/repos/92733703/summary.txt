PipeWire is a low-latency multimedia framework and daemon written in C that serves as a unified server for audio and video pipeline management on Linux systems. It targets system administrators, audio developers, and desktop environment maintainers by providing a graph-based processing architecture that replaces and consolidates PulseAudio, JACK, and ALSA functionality. The framework handles multimedia stream routing, device management, and inter-process communication using socket-based IPC with file descriptor passing. PipeWire solves audio/video fragmentation in Linux by offering backward-compatible APIs for existing audio applications while enabling advanced features like pro-audio low-latency processing, screen sharing for Wayland compositors, and real-time multimedia graph processing, making it essential infrastructure for modern Linux desktop environments and professional audio workflows.
