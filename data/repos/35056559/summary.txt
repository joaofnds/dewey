This repository provides code examples from the book "Clojure for the Brave and True," serving as a companion resource for learning the Clojure programming language. Organized by chapter, each directory contains Clojure code examples and associated notes, mirroring the structure of the book. It is designed to facilitate hands-on learning and understanding of Clojure concepts and syntax. This constitutes an example project for educational purposes, specifically targeting individuals learning Clojure.
