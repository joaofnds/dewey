This repository contains the complete code examples from the book "Clojure for the Brave and True," serving as a hands-on learning resource for functional programming education. Organized by chapter directories, it provides practical Clojure implementations covering core language concepts, data structures, concurrency primitives, macros, and functional programming paradigms. The codebase targets software developers transitioning to functional programming or learning Clojure specifically, offering executable examples that demonstrate idiomatic Clojure patterns, immutable data manipulation, and JVM interoperability. It addresses the educational gap in functional programming by providing working code samples that reinforce theoretical concepts from the accompanying book, making it particularly valuable for developers from imperative programming backgrounds seeking to understand Lisp-family languages and functional programming methodologies.
