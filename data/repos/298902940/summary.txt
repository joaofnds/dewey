octo.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides native GitHub integration for software developers working within terminal-based development environments. It enables direct editing and management of GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions from within the Neovim editor, eliminating context switching between browser and IDE. The plugin leverages the GitHub CLI for API authentication and communication, integrating with popular Neovim ecosystem tools like Telescope, fzf-lua, or snacks.nvim for fuzzy finding and plenary.nvim for async operations. It addresses the workflow inefficiency of web-based GitHub interactions by allowing developers to perform code reviews, comment management, label assignment, and issue tracking directly in their preferred text editor, particularly benefiting terminal-centric developers who prefer keyboard-driven workflows over GUI-based GitHub web interface interactions.
