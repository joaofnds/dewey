`octo.nvim` is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that enhances developer productivity by enabling direct editing and review of GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions within the editor. It provides functionalities to manage issues, PRs (listing, editing, creating, merging), and perform actions like adding comments, reactions, labels, and assignees. The plugin leverages the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for interaction and supports integrations with popular Neovim plugin managers, completion engines (e.g., nvim-cmp), and UI components (e.g., telescope.nvim, fzf-lua). It's a developer productivity tool targeting Neovim users who actively manage GitHub projects.
