ts-pattern is a TypeScript library that brings functional programming-style pattern matching to JavaScript/TypeScript applications, serving as a type-safe alternative to traditional if/else and switch statements. Targeting web developers working with TypeScript, it provides exhaustive pattern matching capabilities with advanced type inference for complex data structures including nested objects, arrays, tuples, Sets, and Maps. The library solves conditional logic complexity in frontend applications, particularly useful for state management, reducers, API response handling, and data validation scenarios. It features a compact 2kB bundle size, supports predicates, unions, intersections, property selection, and enforces exhaustiveness checking to prevent runtime errors. The primary use cases include React state reducers, complex branching logic, and type-safe data structure validation in modern TypeScript applications.
