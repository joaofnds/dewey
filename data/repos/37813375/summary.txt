This Elixir library provides JSON:API specification v1.1 compliant serialization and query parsing for web API development. It integrates with Phoenix framework and Ecto ORM to transform Elixir data models into standardized JSON:API document format, supporting compound documents, relationships, sparse fieldsets, pagination, filtering, and sorting. The library includes a `JSONAPI.View` module for defining resource representations, a `JSONAPI.QueryParser` plug for validating and parsing query parameters, and serialization utilities that handle field transformation (camelCase/dasherized). Targeted at Elixir/Phoenix web developers building REST APIs, it solves the complexity of manually implementing JSON:API specification requirements by providing declarative views and automatic query parameter validation, enabling consistent API responses and client-server communication in web applications following JSON:API standards.
