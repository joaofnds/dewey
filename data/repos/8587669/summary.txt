`git2go` is a Go library providing bindings for the `libgit2` C library, enabling Git functionality within Go applications. It facilitates low-level access to Git operations like repository manipulation, object access, and branching. The library supports both dynamic and static linking against `libgit2` and includes features for managing dependencies and build configurations with different libgit2 versions. This project is a developer productivity tool for Go programmers needing to integrate Git capabilities into their software projects, enabling Git operations directly within their Go applications.
