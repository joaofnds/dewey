git2go is a Go binding library for libgit2 that provides programmatic access to Git version control functionality within Go applications. Targeting DevOps engineers, system administrators, and Go developers building Git-integrated tools, it wraps the libgit2 C library to enable Git operations like repository manipulation, commit handling, branching, and network operations directly from Go code. The library supports both dynamic and static linking configurations, offers versioned modules aligned with libgit2 releases, and handles cross-platform compilation with CGo. It solves the problem of integrating Git functionality into Go applications without executing external Git commands, enabling developers to build sophisticated version control tools, automated deployment systems, and Git-based workflows with native Go performance and type safety.
