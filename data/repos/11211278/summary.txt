RequireBin is a client-side web application that enables developers to write and execute browser JavaScript programs using NPM modules without local setup. Built for the web development domain, it leverages Browserify for module bundling, wzrd.in for browserify-as-a-service, and GitHub's Gatekeeper for OAuth authentication to publish code as gists. The application runs entirely in the browser (hosted on GitHub Pages) while depending on external APIs for module resolution and bundling, solving the problem of quickly prototyping and sharing JavaScript code that uses CommonJS/NPM modules in browser environments. It targets frontend developers and JavaScript engineers who need a rapid development environment for testing NPM packages or creating shareable code snippets without managing local build toolchains or module bundlers.
