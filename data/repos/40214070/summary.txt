`express-graphql` was a deprecated TypeScript-based Express.js middleware that enabled GraphQL HTTP server functionality by integrating GraphQL query execution with Express web applications. Targeting web developers building GraphQL APIs, it served as the original reference implementation for transporting GraphQL over HTTP since 2015. The library addressed the fundamental problem of exposing GraphQL schemas through HTTP endpoints in Node.js Express applications, allowing developers to handle GraphQL queries, mutations, and schema introspection via standard HTTP requests. It has been superseded by `graphql-http`, which implements the standardized GraphQL over HTTP specification, with users now recommended to migrate to full-featured alternatives like `graphql-yoga`, `apollo-server`, or `mercurius` for production GraphQL server implementations with advanced features.
