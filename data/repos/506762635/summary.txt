`Dismember` is a command-line toolkit written in Go designed for scanning the memory of Linux processes to identify secrets and other sensitive information. It provides `grep` functionality for searching memory with regular expressions and a `scan` command for predefined secret pattern detection. The application allows users to list, explore, and interact with processes, including functionalities to find processes by name or PID, display process trees, and manage process lifecycle (suspend/resume/kill). This standalone CLI application operates in the security and system administration domain, and would be most beneficial to system administrators and security professionals performing penetration testing or forensic analysis.
