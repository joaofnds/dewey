Dismember is a Go-based command-line toolkit for Linux systems that scans process memory to detect secrets, credentials, and sensitive data using regex pattern matching. Targeting cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and system administrators, it leverages the `/proc` filesystem to access and analyze memory contents across running processes. The tool provides two primary functions: grep-based memory searching for custom patterns and automated scanning using predefined secret detection rules for common tokens like API keys and passwords. It includes additional process management utilities for listing, monitoring, and controlling processes. Primarily used in CTF competitions, security auditing, and incident response scenarios, Dismember addresses the need for runtime memory analysis and credential discovery in Linux environments without requiring complex debugging tools or process attachment.
