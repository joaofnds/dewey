Halite is a Clojure-based library providing a LISP-like constraint expression language. Built upon open-source formal modeling tools, particularly the Choco constraint programming library, it enables the creation and evaluation of constraint expressions. As a pre-release version, the API is subject to change. This project serves as a successor to the `Salt` project, likely offering an evolved approach to constraint-based problem solving.
