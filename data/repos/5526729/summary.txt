gpakosz/.tmux is a comprehensive tmux configuration framework designed for terminal-based development environments. Built primarily with Shell scripting, it provides a pre-configured, aesthetically enhanced tmux setup targeting developers, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who rely heavily on terminal multiplexing. The configuration includes Powerline-style status bars, custom key bindings, theme support, and cross-platform compatibility across Linux, macOS, OpenBSD, and WSL environments. It solves the complexity of manually configuring tmux by offering a self-contained, drop-in replacement that enhances productivity through improved visual design, ergonomic shortcuts, and extensible customization options via local configuration files, while maintaining compatibility with existing tmux workflows and plugin ecosystems.
