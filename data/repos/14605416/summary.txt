Sprig is a Go library that extends Go's built-in text/template and html/template packages with over 100 utility functions for template processing. Targeting web developers and DevOps engineers working with Go-based applications, it provides essential template functions for string manipulation, formatting, type conversion, arithmetic operations, and layout building that are commonly needed in web templating scenarios. The library fills gaps in Go's minimal template function set by offering functionality inspired by Twig and JavaScript libraries like underscore.js, enabling developers to perform complex template operations without writing custom template functions. Sprig integrates seamlessly with existing Go template workflows and is particularly valuable for applications requiring sophisticated HTML generation, configuration file templating, or any Go-based templating system needing enhanced formatting capabilities.
