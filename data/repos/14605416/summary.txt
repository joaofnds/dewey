`sprig` is a Go library providing over 100 template functions designed to enhance Go's built-in template language capabilities. It equips developers with functionalities including formatting, layout manipulation, and simple type conversions, mirroring features found in template engines like Twig and JavaScript libraries such as underscore.js. This library offers template developers a set of tools for common formatting and layout needs, including arithmetic operations, enabling more complex template logic within Go applications. As a library, `sprig` integrates into Go projects to extend the core template functionality and is primarily targeted towards Go developers working with templating systems.
