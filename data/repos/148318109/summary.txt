`orgize` is a Rust library providing parsing and manipulation capabilities for org-mode files. It enables parsing org-mode strings into a syntax tree, allowing for traversal, modification, and rendering to HTML. Key functionalities include custom parse configuration, syntax tree traversal, range-based text replacement, and HTML export. The library supports optional features like `chrono` for timestamp conversions and `indexmap` for property handling. This is a Rust library, designed for developers needing programmatic interaction with org-mode files, likely for tasks like text processing, document generation, or integration with other tools.
