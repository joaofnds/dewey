Orgize is a Rust library for parsing and manipulating org-mode files, targeting developers working with Emacs org-mode documents in Rust applications. Built on the Rowan syntax tree library, it provides a complete parser that generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for org-mode markup, supporting headline parsing, TODO keywords, tags, timestamps, and property drawers. The library offers traversal APIs for walking syntax trees, in-place modification capabilities through range replacement, and HTML export functionality. It includes optional integrations with chrono for timestamp handling and IndexMap for property management. The tool serves developers building text processing applications, documentation tools, LSP servers, or CLI utilities that need to programmatically read, analyze, or transform org-mode files within Rust ecosystems.
