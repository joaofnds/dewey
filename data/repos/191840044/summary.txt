The `oam-dev/spec` repository defines the Open Application Model (OAM), a standard for modeling cloud-native applications across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, focusing on application-centric deployment rather than infrastructure details. OAM provides higher-level abstractions and modular, extensible designs, enabling portable application definitions that are vendor-agnostic. It aims to simplify application delivery and management, facilitating consistent deployment across Kubernetes, cloud providers, and edge devices. This project acts as a specification and guide, with implementations like KubeVela, targeted towards developers building and deploying cloud-native applications.
