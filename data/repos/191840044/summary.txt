The Open Application Model (OAM) is a cloud-native specification that defines standardized abstractions for modeling and deploying distributed applications across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform developers working with Kubernetes, microservices, and serverless architectures, OAM provides higher-level APIs that separate application concerns from infrastructure details. The specification enables application-centric deployment models that are portable across different cloud providers, on-premises clusters, and edge devices, addressing vendor lock-in and infrastructure complexity issues. Implemented primarily through the KubeVela project and hosted by CNCF, OAM allows developers to define self-contained application deployment configurations with operational behaviors, reducing the need to manage cluster-specific details like ingresses, DNS, and labels while maintaining extensibility and platform agnosticism.
