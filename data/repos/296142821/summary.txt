This repository is a curated list of tunneling software and services that enable developers and self-hosters to expose local web servers and applications through public domains, bypassing NAT restrictions and firewalls. Targeting the DevOps and web development domains, it catalogs open-source alternatives to commercial services like ngrok and Cloudflare Tunnel, focusing on self-hosted solutions for HTTP/TCP tunneling with automatic HTTPS certificate management. The collection covers tools built in various languages including Go (frp, chisel), Rust (rathole, bore), Python, and Node.js, addressing reverse proxy, SSH tunneling, and network traversal use cases. Primary users include developers needing to expose localhost services for testing, self-hosting enthusiasts seeking privacy-focused alternatives to commercial tunneling services, and system administrators requiring production-ready tunnel proxy solutions for secure remote access to internal applications.
