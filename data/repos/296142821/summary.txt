This repository curates a comprehensive list of tunneling software and services, primarily focusing on alternatives to ngrok and Cloudflare Tunnel, with an emphasis on self-hosting solutions. The project aims to help users, especially self-hosters and developers, expose local services through public domain names, including automated HTTPS certificate management. It catalogs various open-source and commercial tools, highlighting key functionalities such as SSH tunneling, TCP/UDP proxying, WebSockets, and overlay network implementations built upon technologies like WireGuard, SSH, and Go, along with languages such as C and Rust, addressing the developer productivity domain. This is a curated list, a reference resource, and not a standalone software project.
