`lparallel` is a Common Lisp library providing parallel programming capabilities. It offers a task submission model with receiving queues, fine-grained parallelism constructs, and asynchronous condition handling. Key functionalities include parallel implementations of common list operations like `map` and `reduce`, alongside promises, futures, and delayed evaluation. Furthermore, the library provides features like computation trees, bounded and unbounded FIFO queues, task prioritization, and task killing, targeting developers seeking to leverage concurrency within Common Lisp applications. It is a library designed to be used with several Common Lisp implementations.
