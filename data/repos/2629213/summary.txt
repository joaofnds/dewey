lparallel is a comprehensive parallel programming library for Common Lisp that provides high-level concurrency abstractions and task parallelization capabilities. Targeting scientific computing, numerical analysis, and performance-critical Lisp applications, it offers thread-safe constructs including futures, promises, parallel map/reduce operations, computation trees, and priority-based task queues. Built on bordeaux-threads for cross-implementation compatibility, it supports major Lisp implementations (SBCL, Clozure, Allegro, LispWorks, ABCL) and features asynchronous condition handling, timeout management, and fine-grained parallelism controls. The library addresses CPU-intensive workload distribution and concurrent task management challenges faced by Common Lisp developers working on computational applications, research software, and systems requiring efficient parallel processing without low-level thread management complexity.
