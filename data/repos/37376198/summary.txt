TestDisk & PhotoRec is a data recovery toolkit written in C that specializes in partition recovery and file carving for digital forensics and data recovery operations. TestDisk focuses on repairing damaged partition tables and boot sectors across multiple filesystem types including FAT, NTFS, ext2/3, HFS+, ReiserFS, XFS, and UFS, while PhotoRec performs file signature-based data carving to recover over 480 file formats from corrupted storage media. The software targets system administrators, digital forensics investigators, and data recovery specialists who need to recover lost partitions or extract files from damaged storage devices. Both tools operate at the low-level disk sector level, supporting cross-platform deployment on Windows, Linux, BSD variants, and legacy DOS systems for comprehensive storage media recovery scenarios.
