Skopeo is a command-line utility written in Go that performs operations on container images and registries without requiring root privileges or running daemons. Targeting the DevOps and container orchestration domain, it works with OCI images, Docker v2 images, and various storage backends including Docker registries, local directories, and containers/storage. The tool addresses container image management challenges by enabling operations like copying images between registries, inspecting remote images without pulling them, deleting images, and syncing repositories for air-gapped deployments. It supports multiple transport mechanisms (docker://, oci:, dir:, docker-archive:) and integrates with the containers ecosystem including Podman, CRI-O, and Buildah. System administrators, DevOps engineers, and container platform operators use Skopeo for registry management, image distribution, and container workflow automation tasks.
