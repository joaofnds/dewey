`skopeo` is a command-line utility written in Go for interacting with container images and image repositories. Its core purpose is to manage and manipulate container images across various storage mechanisms, including registries like Docker Hub and local OCI directories, without requiring a daemon. Key functionalities include copying images between registries, inspecting image properties without pulling them, deleting images, and syncing repositories. This standalone application offers features for authentication, image inspection, and manifest management, making it a developer productivity tool for container image management and deployment.
