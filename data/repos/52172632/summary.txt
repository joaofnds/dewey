evil-multiedit is an Emacs Lisp package that implements multiple cursor functionality for evil-mode (Vim emulation in Emacs), built on top of iedit-mode. It targets software developers and text editors who use Emacs with Vim-style keybindings, addressing the lack of proper multiple cursor support in the evil-mode ecosystem. The package allows users to select and simultaneously edit multiple text regions containing matching patterns, integrating seamlessly with evil-mode's modal editing paradigm. It provides commands for incrementally selecting matches, navigating between edit regions, and applying changes across all selected areas simultaneously. The tool is distributed via MELPA package manager and comes pre-configured in Doom Emacs, serving developers who need efficient multi-location text editing capabilities within the Emacs/evil-mode development environment.
