Kroki is a unified API gateway for converting textual descriptions into visual diagrams, targeting developers and technical writers who need to generate diagrams programmatically. Built with a modular microservices architecture using Java/Vert.x for the core gateway server and Node.js/JavaScript companion services, it supports 20+ diagram types including PlantUML, Mermaid, GraphViz, BPMN, C4, Excalidraw, and others. The system accepts diagram source code via REST API (GET/POST) with multiple encoding methods (deflate+base64, JSON, plain text) and outputs various formats (SVG, PNG). Deployed via Docker containers, it solves the problem of maintaining multiple diagram generation tools by providing a single, consistent interface for documentation systems, CI/CD pipelines, and developer workflows requiring automated diagram creation from markup languages.
