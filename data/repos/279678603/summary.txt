macintosh.js is a vintage computing emulator that recreates a complete 1991 Macintosh Quadra 900 environment running Mac OS 8 within an Electron desktop application. Built primarily in JavaScript, it emulates the original Motorola 68040 CPU architecture and provides a fully functional classic Mac experience with pre-installed period software including Photoshop 3, games like Oregon Trail and Duke Nukem 3D, and web browsers. The project targets retro computing enthusiasts, digital preservation advocates, and developers interested in historical software systems. It supports cross-platform deployment on Windows, macOS, and Linux, offering file transfer capabilities and disk image mounting. This educational tool serves the vintage computing and digital archaeology domains by making obsolete Mac OS environments accessible on modern hardware without requiring original Apple hardware or complex virtualization setups.
