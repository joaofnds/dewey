`macintosh.js` is a standalone JavaScript application that emulates an Apple Macintosh computer running System 8 within an Electron framework. This project provides a virtualized environment allowing users to experience and interact with a classic Mac OS 8 operating system, including pre-installed applications and games from the era. Built entirely in JavaScript, the application utilizes Electron for cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux) and supports file transfer functionalities. It aims to deliver a nostalgic computing experience rather than a performant or production-ready emulation solution.
