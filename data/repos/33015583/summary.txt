Keras 3 is a multi-backend deep learning framework that provides a unified high-level API for building and training neural networks across TensorFlow, JAX, PyTorch, and OpenVINO backends. Targeting data scientists and machine learning engineers, it abstracts backend-specific implementations to enable framework-agnostic model development for computer vision, natural language processing, audio processing, and time series forecasting applications. The framework solves backend lock-in problems by allowing users to switch between computational backends without code changes, leveraging each framework's performance advantages while maintaining compatibility with existing tf.keras codebases. It supports both eager execution and distributed training across GPUs/TPUs, enabling seamless scaling from development to production environments.
