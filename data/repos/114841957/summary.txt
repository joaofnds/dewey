`env-ci` is a JavaScript library designed to detect and expose environment variables provided by Continuous Integration (CI) services. It parses environment variables from over 30 CI providers, including popular platforms such as Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD, standardizing access to critical build metadata. Key functionalities include determining if a build is running in a CI environment (`isCi`), identifying the CI service (`service`), retrieving the branch name (`branch`), commit SHA (`commit`), and pull request information. This library is primarily a developer productivity tool, enabling developers to easily access CI environment variables within their JavaScript projects.
