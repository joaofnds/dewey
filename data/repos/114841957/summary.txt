env-ci is a JavaScript utility library that standardizes environment variable extraction across 20+ CI/CD services including Travis CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, GitLab CI, and others. Part of the semantic-release ecosystem, it provides a unified API to access build metadata such as branch names, commit SHAs, pull request information, build URLs, and repository slugs regardless of the underlying CI platform. The library normalizes platform-specific environment variables into a consistent interface, enabling DevOps tools and automated release pipelines to operate across different continuous integration services without service-specific code. It primarily serves developers building CI/CD tooling, release automation systems, and deployment scripts that need portable access to build context information across heterogeneous CI environments.
