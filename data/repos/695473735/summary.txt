`daktilo` is a command-line application written in Rust that transforms a user's keyboard into a virtual typewriter, generating typewriter sounds upon key presses. It provides customizable sound presets and allows users to configure key-specific audio events, supporting both press and release events. The application leverages the `rdev` crate for keyboard input and utilizes a configurable TOML file for sound preset definition, including options for sound variation and output device selection. The project is a standalone CLI application targeting users who want to enhance their typing experience with auditory feedback.
