**daktilo** is a cross-platform command-line audio utility written in Rust that provides real-time keyboard event monitoring and audio playback simulation. The application intercepts system-level keypress events using platform-specific APIs (X11 on Linux, native APIs on Windows/macOS) and triggers corresponding typewriter sound effects through audio device interfaces. It targets developers, content creators, and general users seeking enhanced typing experiences or nostalgic audio feedback. The tool features configurable TOML-based sound presets, multi-device audio output support, and customizable sound variation algorithms for tempo and volume modulation. Built with Rust's systems programming capabilities, it addresses the niche domain of desktop productivity enhancement and sensory computing experiences, offering both built-in sound libraries and extensible preset configurations for personalized typing ambiance across Linux, Windows, and macOS environments.
