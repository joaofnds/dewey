ImmortalDB is a JavaScript library providing a persistent, resilient key-value store for web browsers. It addresses the vulnerability of browser-based data storage to cookie clearing, IndexedDB eviction, and LocalStorage limitations by redundantly storing data across Cookies, IndexedDB, and LocalStorage.  The library features a Promise-based API with `set`, `get`, and `remove` methods for interacting with the store, and employs a consensus-based approach to ensure data integrity and self-healing. This project, designed for frontend developers, is installed via npm and utilizes standard HTML5 APIs, providing a reliable alternative to potentially problematic approaches like Evercookie.
