ImmortalDB is a JavaScript library for web development that provides persistent key-value storage in browsers through redundant data replication across multiple storage mechanisms. It simultaneously stores data in Cookies, IndexedDB, and LocalStorage, implementing a consensus-based retrieval system that determines the correct value by majority vote and automatically heals corrupted or missing data across stores. The library addresses browser storage reliability issues where individual storage mechanisms (cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB) can be cleared by users or automatically deleted under storage pressure. It provides a Promise-based API with get/set/remove operations and configurable storage backends including SessionStorage. Target users are web developers requiring resilient client-side data persistence without relying on deprecated plugins or invasive tracking techniques, offering a modern alternative to libraries like Evercookie while respecting user privacy and browser performance.
