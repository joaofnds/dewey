StaticScript is a TypeScript compiler that targets LLVM as a backend, enabling code generation to binary executables. It allows developers to write statically-typed code in TypeScript, and then compile it for performance optimization via LLVM. This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool, demonstrated through examples, that converts TypeScript source code into executable binaries. It leverages TypeScript as a frontend and LLVM for compilation, targeting developers who need to optimize TypeScript code for performance.
