StaticScript is an experimental TypeScript-to-binary compiler that leverages TypeScript's frontend parser and LLVM's backend code generation to produce native executables from TypeScript code. Targeting systems programming and performance-critical applications, it bypasses JavaScript's runtime overhead by compiling directly to machine code through LLVM IR. The compiler parses TypeScript syntax, performs static type analysis, and generates optimized binary executables that can run independently without Node.js or browser environments. Designed for TypeScript developers seeking native performance for computationally intensive tasks like mathematical calculations, simulations, or system utilities, StaticScript bridges the gap between TypeScript's familiar syntax and the execution speed of compiled languages like C++ or Rust.
