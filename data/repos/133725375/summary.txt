WireGuard-go is a userspace implementation of the WireGuard VPN protocol written in Go, targeting network infrastructure and cybersecurity domains. It provides a cross-platform alternative to kernel-based WireGuard implementations, creating virtual network interfaces (TUN) for secure tunneling across Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD. The implementation handles cryptographic key exchange, packet encapsulation, and network interface management through platform-specific drivers (utun on macOS, tun on BSD systems). Primarily designed for system administrators and network engineers who need WireGuard functionality in environments where kernel modules are unavailable or impractical, it serves as a fallback solution for VPN deployments, embedded systems, and development environments requiring secure point-to-point networking without kernel-level modifications.
