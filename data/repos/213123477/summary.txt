REL is a modern Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Go that provides a database access layer designed for layered architecture applications. Built for web development and backend services, it supports PostgreSQL and MySQL databases through multiple adapters and implements the repository pattern for clean data access abstraction. The library features a query builder that supports both programmatic query construction and raw SQL, along with database migrations, eager loading, soft deletion, pagination, and composite primary keys. REL emphasizes testability through its built-in reltest package that enables seamless unit testing without database dependencies, supports nested transactions, and integrates with popular Go web frameworks like Gin, Chi, and Iris, targeting backend developers building scalable web applications and APIs.
