nvim-orgmode is a Lua-based Neovim plugin that implements Org-mode functionality for text editing and personal information management within the Neovim ecosystem. Targeting developers and power users who prefer Neovim over Emacs, it provides core organizational features including agenda views, task scheduling, time tracking, note capturing, and document structuring with TODO states and tags. The plugin leverages Neovim's Lua API and integrates with treesitter for syntax highlighting, offering features like date/time management with repeaters, file archiving, headline promotion/demotion, and export capabilities via external tools like Emacs and Pandoc. It serves the productivity and note-taking domain by enabling developers to manage projects, tasks, and documentation directly within their preferred Neovim environment without switching to Emacs for Org-mode functionality.
