Proxify is a Go-based Swiss Army knife proxy tool designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and security researchers conducting HTTP/HTTPS traffic analysis and manipulation. It functions as a comprehensive man-in-the-middle (MITM) proxy supporting both HTTP and SOCKS5 protocols, enabling real-time interception, filtering, and modification of web traffic through a domain-specific language (DSL). The tool provides TLS certificate management for HTTPS interception, traffic dumping capabilities for forensic analysis, and integration with popular security testing frameworks like BurpSuite through traffic replay functionality. Key features include upstream proxy chaining, embedded DNS server, protocol-specific plugins for XMPP/SMTP/FTP/SSH, and support for both visible web applications and thick client traffic analysis, making it essential for web application security testing, network traffic analysis, and security research workflows.
