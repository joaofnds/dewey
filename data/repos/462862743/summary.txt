**oxide.ts** is a TypeScript library that implements Rust's `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` types for JavaScript/TypeScript web development environments. It provides functional programming constructs for explicit null safety and error handling, offering methods like `map`, `unwrap`, `expect`, and pattern matching to eliminate common runtime errors from null/undefined values and unhandled exceptions. The zero-dependency library targets TypeScript developers building web applications, Node.js services, or frontend frameworks who want to adopt Rust-style error handling patterns instead of traditional try-catch blocks or nullable types. It includes advanced features like tuple conversion, nested result handling, and compile-time type safety, enabling developers to write more robust code by making potential failures explicit in the type system rather than relying on runtime checks.
