delimitMate is a Vim Script plugin that provides automatic delimiter completion and management for code editing in Vim. It automatically inserts closing quotes, parentheses, brackets, and braces during insert mode, while offering syntax-aware behavior that prevents insertion in comments and other configurable code regions. The plugin targets software developers across all programming domains who use Vim as their primary editor, addressing the common problem of manual delimiter management that can lead to syntax errors and reduced coding efficiency. Key features include configurable CR and Space expansions, FileType-specific customization through autocmd, and global variable configuration options. The plugin enhances developer productivity by reducing repetitive keystrokes and preventing mismatched delimiter errors during code composition across any programming language supported by Vim.
