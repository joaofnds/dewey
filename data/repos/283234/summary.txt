`delimitMate` is a Vim plugin designed to enhance developer productivity by automating the insertion of closing delimiters (quotes, parentheses, brackets, etc.) in insert mode. This plugin provides syntax-aware auto-completion, preventing insertion within comments and configurable regions, alongside optional features like <CR> and <Space> expansions. Implemented in Vim Script, it allows extensive customization and file-type-specific configurations through global variables and `:autocmd`. This developer tool focuses on improving the editing experience within the Vim text editor.
