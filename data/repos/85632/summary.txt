clojure-mode is an Emacs major mode package that provides comprehensive IDE-like support for Clojure and ClojureScript development within the Emacs text editor. Written in Emacs Lisp, it delivers syntax highlighting, intelligent indentation, code navigation, and refactoring capabilities for functional programming in the Clojure ecosystem. The package bundles multiple major modes supporting various Clojure dialects including ClojureScript, ClojureDart, and Jank, with automatic mode selection based on file extensions. It implements community-standard indentation rules from the Clojure Style Guide while offering extensive customization options for different coding styles. Targeted at Clojure developers who prefer Emacs as their development environment, it solves the problem of lacking native Clojure language support in Emacs, enabling productive functional programming workflows for web development, data processing, and JVM-based applications.
