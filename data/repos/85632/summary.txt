`clojure-mode` is an Emacs major mode providing extensive support for the Clojure and ClojureScript programming languages. It facilitates syntax highlighting, indentation, navigation, and refactoring capabilities tailored for Clojure code editing within Emacs. Functionality includes multiple bundled major modes for `.clj`, `.cljs`, and `.cljc` files, customizable indentation, and refactoring features such as threading macros, collection transformations, and namespace alias renaming, all implemented in Emacs Lisp. This project functions as an Emacs extension, enhancing the development workflow for Clojure developers.
