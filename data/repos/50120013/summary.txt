Amber is a command-line code search and replace tool written in Rust, designed for software developers and system administrators working with large codebases. It provides two core utilities: `ambs` for searching and `ambr` for interactive text replacement across directory trees. The tool leverages multi-threaded parallel processing for large files, supports regex pattern matching with capture groups, and includes intelligent defaults like VCS directory exclusion (.git, .hg, .svn) and binary file filtering. Built for DevOps and software development workflows, amber serves as a modern alternative to traditional grep/sed/awk pipelines, offering interactive replacement prompts and configurable TOML-based settings. It targets developers who need efficient code refactoring capabilities across multi-file projects, providing better performance than conventional find/xargs/sed combinations while maintaining user control through interactive replacement workflows.
