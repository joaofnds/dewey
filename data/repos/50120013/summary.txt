`amber` is a command-line code search and replace tool written in Rust, designed for developer productivity. It provides functionalities similar to `grep` and `sed`, including recursive file searching, ignoring VCS directories and binary files, and colored output. The tool offers both search (`ambs`) and interactive replace (`ambr`) commands, with support for regular expressions in replacements. It includes configuration options via TOML files and benchmarks demonstrating its performance relative to tools like `ripgrep`, `grep`, `fastmod`, and `find/sed`. This is a standalone CLI application.
