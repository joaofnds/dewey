`RubyLisp` is a Lisp dialect implemented in Ruby, aiming to provide a Clojure-inspired scripting experience within the Ruby ecosystem. This project allows users to write Ruby scripts using Lisp syntax, with features including Ruby interop, immutable data structures (lists, vectors, maps) provided by the Hamster library, and Clojure-style atoms from concurrent-ruby. The tool provides a REPL and supports running RubyLisp code from files, and is primarily a developer productivity tool.
