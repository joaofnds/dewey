RubyLisp (rbl) is a Lisp dialect interpreter implemented in Ruby that provides Clojure-inspired syntax and semantics for scripting applications. Targeting developers who need a functional programming language for scripting tasks, it addresses the startup time limitations of JVM-based Clojure while maintaining Ruby's extensive library ecosystem and cross-platform compatibility. The interpreter leverages Ruby's standard library as its foundation, implementing immutable data structures via the Hamster library, concurrent primitives through concurrent-ruby, and seamless Ruby interoperability for accessing classes, modules, and instance methods. It features Clojure-style core functions, REPL support, and familiar Lisp constructs including lists, vectors, hash maps, and keywords, making it suitable for developers seeking functional programming paradigms in scripting environments without JVM overhead.
