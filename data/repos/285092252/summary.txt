SST (Serverless Stack Toolkit) is a full-stack application deployment framework targeting web developers building serverless applications on cloud infrastructure. Written in TypeScript with Go CLI components, SST v3 uses Pulumi and Terraform as its deployment engine, replacing the previous CDK/CloudFormation approach. The platform provides infrastructure-as-code tooling for deploying modern web frameworks including Next.js, Remix, and Astro to AWS and other cloud providers. It features live development environments, resource linking capabilities, and a management console for monitoring deployed applications. SST addresses the complexity of configuring and deploying full-stack serverless applications by providing opinionated components and abstractions over raw cloud infrastructure, enabling frontend and full-stack developers to deploy production-ready applications without deep DevOps expertise.
