The `microsoft/BosqueLanguage` repository hosts the Bosque programming language, designed for a machine-assisted, rapid, and reliable software development lifecycle. Bosque is a TypeScript-based language combining functional programming semantics with an ergonomic block and assignment-based syntax, aiming for improved code correctness and developer experience. Key functionalities include a built-in testing framework (unit and property-based), a novel runtime with predictable latency, and API types facilitating integration into polyglot systems. This project also includes a package manager and associated tooling (the `bosque` command), providing build, test, and application management capabilities. It's a standalone language implementation and associated tooling targeting developers building cloud-native applications.
