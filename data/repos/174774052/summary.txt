The Bosque programming language is an experimental functional-imperative hybrid language implemented in TypeScript, designed for machine-assisted software development with a focus on code correctness and reliability. It targets general-purpose application development, particularly cloud-native and distributed systems including serverless and microservice architectures. The language features a novel bytecode intermediate representation enabling automated code reasoning, SMT-powered property-based testing, symbolic execution for error detection, and a pathology-free runtime with predictable garbage collection behavior. Key components include a built-in testing framework, API type system with JSON encoding for polyglot integration, and package manager with automated verification capabilities. The project primarily serves software developers building high-reliability applications who need advanced static analysis, formal verification capabilities, and integration with existing Node.js or C++ codebases.
