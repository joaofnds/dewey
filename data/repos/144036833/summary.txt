Arduino CLI is a comprehensive command-line tool written in Go that provides essential development infrastructure for Arduino and compatible microcontroller platforms. It serves the embedded systems and IoT development domain by offering board management, library management, sketch compilation, board detection, and firmware uploading capabilities through both CLI and programmatic interfaces. The tool eliminates dependency on the Arduino IDE for automated workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and headless development environments. It targets embedded systems developers, IoT engineers, and DevOps practitioners who need to integrate Arduino development into automated build systems, testing frameworks, or remote deployment scenarios. The Go-based architecture enables cross-platform distribution and reliable integration with existing toolchains for professional embedded development workflows.
