`nvimtools/none-ls.nvim` is a Neovim plugin providing a bridge to integrate non-LSP sources, like command-line tools, into Neovim's LSP client for diagnostics, code actions, formatting, hover information, and completion. Written in Lua, it allows users to leverage existing CLI tools for various language features by transforming their output into LSP-compatible formats. The plugin facilitates custom source creation and includes built-in sources for common tasks, relying on `plenary.nvim` as a dependency and targeting Neovim users who want to enhance their editing environment with external tools. This is a plugin/extension for Neovim.
