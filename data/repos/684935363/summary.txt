none-ls.nvim is a Neovim plugin that enables the editor to function as a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server, allowing non-LSP tools to integrate with Neovim's LSP ecosystem. Written in Lua, it bridges external CLI tools like linters, formatters, and code analyzers with LSP features including diagnostics, code actions, formatting, hover, and completion. The plugin targets software developers working in diverse programming environments who want to consolidate tooling through Neovim's LSP client rather than managing separate processes. It solves the limitation where Neovim's LSP infrastructure couldn't natively accommodate non-LSP sources, reducing boilerplate configuration and improving performance by eliminating external process overhead. The tool provides built-in sources for popular development tools and helpers for creating custom integrations, making it particularly valuable for developers seeking unified LSP-based workflows across multiple languages and tools.
