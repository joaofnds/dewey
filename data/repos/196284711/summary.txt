Cascadia Code is a monospaced programming font developed by Microsoft specifically for software development environments, serving as the default typeface for Windows Terminal and Visual Studio. The font targets developers, programmers, and terminal users by providing enhanced code readability through programming ligatures that combine common multi-character operators (like `->`, `==`, `>=`) into single glyphs. It offers multiple variants including ligature-enabled Code, ligature-free Mono, Powerline symbol-embedded PL versions, and Nerd Font symbol NF versions, distributed in TTF variable/static, OTF static, and WOFF2 formats. The font includes OpenType features, stylistic sets, and supports extensive character sets including legacy computing symbols, addressing the specific typographic needs of code editors, terminals, and development IDEs across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.
