This is a GitHub Action implementation written in TypeScript that automates Docker image building and pushing workflows within CI/CD pipelines. Targeting DevOps engineers and software developers, it leverages Docker Buildx and Moby BuildKit to provide advanced containerization capabilities including multi-platform builds, remote caching, and secrets management. The action integrates with Docker registries like DockerHub and supports both Git and path-based build contexts, eliminating the need for manual checkout steps in many scenarios. It addresses the core DevOps challenge of streamlining container image delivery pipelines by providing a declarative interface for complex Docker build operations within GitHub's automation ecosystem, supporting cross-architecture deployments and modern container build optimizations essential for cloud-native application development.
