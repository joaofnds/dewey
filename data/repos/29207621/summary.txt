Caddy is a modern HTTP/1-3 web server written in Go that provides automatic HTTPS certificate management and serves as an extensible reverse proxy platform. Targeting web developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators, it leverages ACME protocol integration with Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL for zero-configuration TLS certificate provisioning and renewal. The server features a modular architecture supporting dynamic configuration through JSON APIs, human-readable Caddyfile syntax, and comprehensive HTTP protocol support including HTTP/3 and TLS 1.3 with Encrypted ClientHello. Caddy solves the complexity of manual SSL/TLS certificate management while providing production-ready web serving, reverse proxying, and load balancing capabilities with built-in security defaults, making HTTPS deployment effortless for modern web infrastructure.
