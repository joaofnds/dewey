JavaScript Obfuscator is a comprehensive source code protection tool built in TypeScript that transforms JavaScript and Node.js applications to prevent reverse engineering and intellectual property theft. Targeting web developers, security engineers, and software vendors who need to protect client-side code, it implements advanced obfuscation techniques including variable renaming, string encryption, dead code injection, control flow flattening, and identifier mangling. The tool integrates with popular build systems through plugins for Webpack, Gulp, Grunt, Rollup, and other JavaScript bundlers, making it suitable for both browser and Node.js environments. It addresses the critical security challenge of protecting proprietary JavaScript logic in web applications where source code is inherently exposed to end users, providing multiple layers of code transformation to significantly increase the difficulty of code analysis and modification.
