WMR (Web Modules Runtime) is a discontinued all-in-one development tool specifically designed for modern web application development, with a focus on Preact-based projects. Built on JavaScript and leveraging Rollup for production builds, it provides zero-configuration bundling, hot module reloading, native ES modules support, and automatic npm package resolution without installation. The tool targets frontend developers building modern web applications by solving the complexity of development toolchain setup, offering features like TypeScript support, CSS modules, static site generation with pre-rendering, and HTTP2 serving capabilities. WMR's architecture eliminates the need for entry point configuration by using HTML files with ES module scripts, while providing optimized production builds through Rollup bundling. The project has been deprecated in favor of Vite with Preact preset integration, indicating its role as a predecessor to more established modern frontend build tools.
