Prometheus is an open-source systems and service monitoring platform written in Go that functions as a time series database for collecting, storing, and querying infrastructure and application metrics. Designed for DevOps and site reliability engineering teams, it implements a pull-based HTTP model to scrape metrics from configured targets at regular intervals, storing data in a multi-dimensional time series format. The system features PromQL, a specialized query language for analyzing metrics data, built-in alerting capabilities, and service discovery mechanisms for dynamic environments. Prometheus operates as autonomous single-server nodes without requiring distributed storage, making it suitable for monitoring cloud-native applications, microservices, and traditional infrastructure. It integrates with visualization tools like Grafana and supports federation for scaling across multiple instances in enterprise environments.
