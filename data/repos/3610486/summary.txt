Nominatim is an open-source geocoding service that provides forward and reverse geocoding capabilities using OpenStreetMap data. Built primarily in Python with PostgreSQL backend integration, it enables developers to convert addresses to geographic coordinates (geocoding) and coordinates back to human-readable addresses (reverse geocoding). The system processes OSM data through osm2pgsql with Lua configuration scripts, serves results via a web API using Falcon framework and uvicorn ASGI server, and supports both standalone installations and web service deployments. Targeting GIS developers, mapping application creators, and system administrators in the geospatial domain, Nominatim solves the core problem of location search and address resolution for web applications, mobile apps, and geographic information systems requiring reliable, open-source geocoding functionality without dependency on commercial mapping services.
