Nominatim is a Python-based standalone application providing geocoding and reverse geocoding functionalities, leveraging OpenStreetMap data. It allows users to search OpenStreetMap data by name and address and generate synthetic addresses for OSM points. The core functionality is implemented in Python with dependencies including `packaging/nominatim-{api,db}`, along with `uvicorn` and `falcon` for serving the application. The project involves data import processes and webserver setup to facilitate its geocoding operations, indicating a system administration and geographic data processing focus.
