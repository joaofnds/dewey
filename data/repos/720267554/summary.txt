`dotenvx/dotenvx` is a JavaScript CLI tool and library designed as a "better dotenv," providing enhanced environment variable management for various programming languages and platforms. It focuses on simplifying configuration and secret management, including multi-environment support and end-to-end encryption for `.env` files using Secp256k1 cryptography. Core functionality centers on runtime environment variable injection, variable expansion, command substitution, and CLI extensions like example generation, gitignore integration, and secret scanning, all aimed at improving developer productivity. The project serves as a developer productivity tool, offering a CLI with flexible installation options (curl, brew, etc.) and a library for direct integration within JavaScript projects.
