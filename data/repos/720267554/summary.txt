**dotenvx** is a cross-platform CLI tool and JavaScript library for managing environment variables and application secrets across multiple environments in software development workflows. Built as an enhanced successor to the popular dotenv library, it provides secure secret management through end-to-end encryption, multi-environment configuration support, and universal compatibility across programming languages including Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, and Deno. The tool addresses configuration management challenges in DevOps and web development by enabling developers to securely load environment variables from .env files into applications without language-specific dependencies. It targets software developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who need robust environment variable management with encryption capabilities for local development, CI/CD pipelines, and production deployments across diverse technology stacks.
