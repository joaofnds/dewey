boole.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that extends the editor's default increment/decrement functionality (Ctrl-A/Ctrl-X) to handle semantic value cycling beyond numeric operations. The plugin enables developers to toggle between boolean pairs (true/false, on/off, yes/no), cycle through predefined sequences like days of the week, months, X11 color names, and alphanumeric identifiers (F1â†’F2). It integrates directly into Neovim's key mapping system and supports user-defined custom cycles with configurable case sensitivity handling. This addresses the common developer workflow inefficiency of manually editing semantic toggles and sequential values in code, configuration files, and documentation. The plugin targets software developers, DevOps engineers, and technical writers working within the Neovim ecosystem who frequently modify boolean flags, configuration parameters, and structured text content requiring semantic rather than purely numeric increment operations.
