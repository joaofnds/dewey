`boole.nvim` is a Neovim plugin extending the editor's increment/decrement functionality for toggling boolean-like values and cycling through lists of strings. Implemented in Lua, the plugin allows cycling through days, months, colors, and other custom user-defined loops. It provides a `:Boole` command that can be mapped to CTRL-A and CTRL-X, with configuration options for custom mappings and additions. This plugin aims to enhance developer productivity within the Neovim text editor environment.
