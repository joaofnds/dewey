TextTest is a Python-based approval testing framework designed for text-based functional and regression testing across software development domains. It compares program output files against "gold standard" baselines using configurable comparators like diff, enabling developers and QA engineers to detect behavioral changes in applications. The tool features PyGTK-based GUI interfaces for test management and execution, integrates with version control systems (CVS, Bazaar, Mercurial), and supports distributed testing via Grid Engine, LSF, and Amazon EC2. TextTest includes plugins for bug tracking systems (Bugzilla, Jira, Trac) and bundles StoryText for GUI testing through record/replay functionality. It operates cross-platform on UNIX and Windows, targeting software teams performing systematic regression testing of command-line applications, executables, and GUI programs where output verification is critical for quality assurance.
