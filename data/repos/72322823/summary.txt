`opossum` is a Node.js library implementing the circuit breaker pattern to enhance the resilience of asynchronous JavaScript applications. It monitors the execution of asynchronous functions, enabling rapid failure detection and prevention of cascading failures. Key features include configurable timeouts, error thresholds, and fallback functions, alongside support for `AbortController` for request cancellation and advanced options like call coalescing. This library facilitates improved application stability within the backend of Node.js applications, and is primarily used by JavaScript developers.
