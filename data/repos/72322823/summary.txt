Opossum is a Node.js circuit breaker library implementing the circuit breaker pattern for resilient microservices and distributed systems. Built in JavaScript with Promise support, it wraps asynchronous functions to monitor execution status and fail fast when services become unreliable, preventing cascading failures in web applications and APIs. The library provides configurable timeout thresholds, error percentage triggers, fallback mechanisms, and state management (closed/open/half-open) for network operations, database calls, and external service integrations. It includes AbortController support for request cancellation, browser compatibility, event emission for monitoring, and state persistence for serverless environments. Targeted at backend Node.js developers and DevOps engineers building fault-tolerant distributed architectures, it serves as an alternative to Netflix Hystrix for JavaScript ecosystems requiring reliable service-to-service communication.
