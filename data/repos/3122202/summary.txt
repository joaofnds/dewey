RxJS is a JavaScript library providing Reactive Extensions for creating asynchronous and event-driven programs using observable sequences. It enables developers to compose complex logic with operators for filtering, transforming, and combining asynchronous data streams. This library facilitates functional reactive programming in JavaScript, managing events, asynchronous operations, and data propagation effectively. It functions as a core dependency for front-end and back-end applications.
