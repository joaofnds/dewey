RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library that implements reactive programming patterns for handling asynchronous and event-based operations in JavaScript applications. Targeting web developers and Node.js developers, it provides Observable sequences, operators, and schedulers to compose and manipulate asynchronous data streams from sources like HTTP requests, user events, WebSockets, and timers. The library applies functional programming concepts similar to Array methods (map, filter, reduce) to event streams, enabling developers to declaratively handle complex asynchronous workflows, error handling, and cancellation. RxJS addresses the complexity of managing multiple concurrent asynchronous operations in modern web applications by providing a unified API for stream composition, making it particularly valuable for reactive architectures in frontend frameworks and real-time data processing scenarios.
