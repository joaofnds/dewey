Anki is a spaced repetition learning application implemented in Rust with a shared backend architecture serving both Qt desktop and web frontends. The repository contains the core business logic for flashcard-based memorization using scientifically-backed spaced repetition algorithms that optimize review scheduling based on memory retention patterns. Built for the education technology domain, it targets students, language learners, and knowledge workers who need systematic long-term retention of factual information. The Rust backend provides cross-platform compatibility and performance for handling large card databases, scheduling algorithms, and synchronization, while supporting multiple frontend implementations. The system addresses the problem of efficient knowledge retention by automating the timing of review sessions based on individual learning patterns and forgetting curves.
