RailsOnLisp (RoL) is a web application framework that implements Ruby on Rails architectural patterns and conventions using Lisp as the primary programming language. This framework targets web developers familiar with Rails' MVC architecture, Active Record ORM patterns, and convention-over-configuration philosophy while leveraging Lisp's functional programming capabilities and macro system. The project addresses the need for Rails-like rapid web development productivity within the Lisp ecosystem, providing familiar abstractions for routing, templating, database interactions, and web server integration. Primary users include Lisp developers seeking modern web framework tooling and Rails developers interested in functional programming paradigms for web application development without abandoning established Rails conventions and project structure patterns.
