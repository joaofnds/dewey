This repository provides a comprehensive community-driven style guide for the Elixir programming language, serving as a standardized reference for code formatting, naming conventions, and best practices in functional programming. Targeting Elixir developers across web development, distributed systems, and backend services domains, the guide covers critical areas including module organization, documentation with typespecs, pattern matching, metaprogramming, testing methodologies, and integration with Elixir's built-in code formatter introduced in v1.6. The guide addresses the need for consistent code quality and readability in Elixir codebases by establishing conventions for whitespace, indentation, function definitions, struct usage, exception handling, and collection manipulation, making it an essential resource for developers building fault-tolerant, concurrent applications on the BEAM virtual machine ecosystem.
