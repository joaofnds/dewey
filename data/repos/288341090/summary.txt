Mafs is a TypeScript-based React component library designed for creating interactive mathematical visualizations in web applications. Built specifically for the web development domain, it provides opinionated React components that enable developers to render mathematical concepts, graphs, and geometric shapes directly in the browser. The library targets frontend developers and educators working on educational technology platforms, mathematical learning tools, or scientific visualization applications. Leveraging React's component architecture and TypeScript for type safety, Mafs solves the problem of implementing complex mathematical graphics without requiring low-level canvas manipulation or mathematical rendering expertise. The project includes comprehensive testing infrastructure with visual regression testing using Playwright to ensure rendering consistency across browsers, making it suitable for production educational and scientific web applications.
