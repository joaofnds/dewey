Nyxt is a keyboard-driven web browser built in Common Lisp, targeting power users and developers who prefer programmatic interfaces over traditional mouse-driven browsing. The browser implements familiar keybinding schemes from Emacs, Vim, and CUA, while providing infinite extensibility through Lisp scripting. It addresses productivity limitations of conventional browsers by offering advanced features like fuzzy search tab switching, multi-tab search capabilities, tree-based history navigation, powerful bookmark management with tagging and compound queries, and multiple input selection for batch operations. Designed for the developer/hacker community, Nyxt runs on GNU/Linux, macOS, Windows, and FreeBSD, solving the problem of limited customization and keyboard-centric workflows in mainstream web browsers through its programmable Lisp architecture.
