This repository is a curated "awesome list" that catalogs plugins, themes, and resources for Hyper, an Electron-based terminal emulator developed by Vercel (formerly Zeit). It serves as a comprehensive directory for the Hyper ecosystem, organizing extensions into categories like productivity tools (status lines, tab management, hotkey summoning), visual customization (color schemes, UI modifications), development utilities (Git integration, syntax highlighting), and entertainment plugins. The collection targets developers, system administrators, and power users who want to enhance their terminal experience through Hyper's extensible plugin architecture. All listed packages are distributed via npm and integrate with Hyper's JavaScript-based configuration system, enabling terminal customization beyond traditional shell environments. The repository functions as a discovery platform for the web development and DevOps communities using modern terminal tooling.
