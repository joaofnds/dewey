SkyRocket.spoon is a Hammerspoon-based window management utility written in Lua that enables mouse-driven window resizing and movement through configurable modifier key combinations. It targets macOS power users and system administrators who need precise window control, serving as a replacement for discontinued tools like Zooom/2 and replicating functionality found in BetterTouchTool and Linux desktop environments. The spoon integrates with Hammerspoon's automation framework to capture mouse events and window manipulation APIs, allowing users to move windows via cmd+shift+drag and resize via ctrl+shift+drag operations. It addresses the productivity workflow needs of developers and system administrators who require efficient window management without relying on commercial software, providing customizable opacity settings, per-application disable options, and configurable mouse button mappings for streamlined desktop organization.
