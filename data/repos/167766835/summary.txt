Boop is a macOS-native scriptable text processing tool designed for software developers who need quick data transformation and manipulation capabilities. Built using Swift/Objective-C with Xcode as the primary development environment, it functions as a scratchpad application where developers can apply JavaScript-based scripts to transform text, encode/decode data formats, manipulate JSON, convert between different data representations, and perform common developer tasks like base64 encoding, URL formatting, and text formatting. The application targets general software development workflows across web development, API testing, data processing, and debugging scenarios. Its extensible architecture allows custom script creation for domain-specific transformations, making it particularly valuable for developers who frequently work with APIs, configuration files, log processing, or need rapid text manipulation without switching between multiple command-line tools or online converters.
