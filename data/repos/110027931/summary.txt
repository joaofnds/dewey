MetalLB is a Kubernetes-native network load balancer designed for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters. Implemented in Go, it utilizes standard routing protocols such as BGP and ARP to provide external access to services within a Kubernetes environment, enabling load balancing without relying on cloud-specific infrastructure. This standalone application provides a critical component for deploying Kubernetes on-premises and in environments where cloud provider load balancers are unavailable. It is a core infrastructure tool for system administrators and DevOps engineers managing bare-metal Kubernetes deployments.
