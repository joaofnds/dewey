MetalLB is a bare-metal Kubernetes load balancer implementation written in Go that provides LoadBalancer service functionality for on-premises clusters lacking cloud provider integration. It operates using standard networking protocols including BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and ARP/VRRP for IP address management and traffic distribution. The project integrates with FRR (Free Range Routing) and supports keepalived for high availability configurations. MetalLB solves the critical infrastructure gap where Kubernetes clusters running on physical hardware cannot access cloud-native load balancing services, enabling service exposure through external IP addresses. It targets DevOps engineers, platform administrators, and infrastructure teams managing bare-metal Kubernetes deployments who need network-layer load balancing without dependency on cloud provider services or expensive hardware load balancers.
