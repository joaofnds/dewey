MonitorControl is a macOS utility application written in Swift that enables external monitor control functionality typically reserved for native Apple displays. The application leverages DDC (Display Data Channel) protocol, Apple's native display APIs, and gamma table manipulation to control brightness, contrast, and volume on third-party monitors. It integrates with macOS accessibility frameworks to intercept native keyboard shortcuts and displays system-level OSDs (On-Screen Displays). The tool addresses hardware limitations where external monitors lack seamless integration with macOS brightness and media controls, providing a menubar interface and keyboard shortcut support. Target users are Mac users with external displays who require native-like display control without proprietary manufacturer software, particularly relevant for multi-monitor setups and professional workstations.
