MonitorControl is a standalone macOS application designed to control the brightness and volume of external displays as if they were native Apple displays, utilizing Apple keyboard keys and custom shortcuts. Written in Swift, it leverages DDC/CI protocol for hardware control on compatible displays, along with software dimming alternatives and native protocols for Apple displays, offering features like native macOS OSD integration and smooth brightness transitions. The application provides customization options, including support for user-defined keyboard shortcuts and advanced settings, and integrates several third-party Swift libraries for core functionalities such as media key handling and settings management. This project's target audience is macOS users seeking comprehensive display control and customization options.
