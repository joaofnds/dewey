This Go library provides Relay specification utilities for building GraphQL servers compatible with Facebook's React Relay client framework. It extends the graphql-go library with Relay-specific patterns including node interfaces, connection types, and mutation helpers required for implementing Relay's opinionated GraphQL conventions. The library targets web developers building full-stack JavaScript applications who need backend GraphQL APIs that conform to Relay's requirements for client-side data fetching, caching, and state management. It solves the complexity of manually implementing Relay's connection pagination, global object identification, and mutation input/output patterns in Go-based GraphQL servers, enabling seamless integration between Go backends and React Relay frontend applications.
