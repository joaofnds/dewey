Oh My Fish is a package management framework for the Fish shell that provides infrastructure for extending and customizing shell environments. Built primarily in Shell script, it targets developers, system administrators, and terminal power users who work with Fish shell instead of traditional bash or zsh. The framework enables installation and management of shell themes, prompts, and utility packages through a centralized `omf` command-line utility, similar to oh-my-zsh but specifically designed for Fish shell's unique syntax and features. It addresses the problem of Fish shell's limited ecosystem by providing a unified package repository system, theme management, and plugin architecture for terminal customization and productivity enhancement in development and DevOps workflows.
