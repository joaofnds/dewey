VSCodeVim is a TypeScript-based Visual Studio Code extension that provides comprehensive Vim emulation within the VS Code editor environment. Targeting software developers across all domains who prefer Vim's modal editing paradigm, it implements core Vim functionality including normal, insert, visual, and operator-pending modes, along with extensive keybinding customization and remapping capabilities. The extension emulates popular Vim plugins like vim-easymotion, vim-surround, and vim-commentary, while integrating with VS Code's native features like multi-cursor support and IntelliSense. It addresses the productivity gap for Vim users transitioning to or working within VS Code by preserving familiar keyboard-driven workflows, muscle memory, and editing efficiency without sacrificing modern IDE capabilities like debugging, integrated terminals, and language server protocol support.
