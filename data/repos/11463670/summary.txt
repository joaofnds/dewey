The `leanprover/lean3` repository hosts the Lean Theorem Prover, a programming language and software system designed for interactive theorem proving and formal verification. Built primarily in C++, it leverages dependent types and type theory principles to enable users to formally verify mathematical proofs and software correctness. This project provides tools and libraries for constructing and manipulating mathematical and logical statements within a formally verified environment, functioning as a standalone application and potentially as a foundation for research and education in formal methods.
