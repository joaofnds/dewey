Lean 3 is a theorem prover and functional programming language implemented in C++ that enables formal mathematical verification through dependent type theory. The system targets mathematicians, computer scientists, and verification engineers working in formal methods, proof assistants, and mathematical software verification. Built around the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, Lean provides a foundation for constructing machine-checkable proofs, formalizing mathematical theorems, and verifying software correctness properties. The language combines theorem proving capabilities with practical programming features, supporting tactics-based proof construction and type-driven development. Users can formalize complex mathematical concepts, verify algorithm correctness, and build certified software systems where mathematical rigor and proof verification are essential requirements.
