This repository is a fork of QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) firmware, a C-based embedded firmware framework for custom mechanical keyboards targeting Atmel AVR and ARM microcontrollers. Built upon the tmk_keyboard foundation, it provides low-level hardware abstraction, key mapping, macro support, and real-time input processing for enthusiast keyboards like Planck, ErgoDox EZ, and Clueboard. The firmware addresses the embedded systems domain, specifically HID (Human Interface Device) development, enabling keyboard manufacturers and hobbyists to create fully customizable input devices with advanced features like programmable layouts, RGB lighting control, and rotary encoder support. Target users include embedded developers, keyboard designers, and hardware enthusiasts who require precise control over keyboard behavior and functionality beyond standard commercial offerings.
