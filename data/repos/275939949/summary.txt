This repository is the firmware for the Anne Pro keyboard, previously maintained separately but now merged into the main QMK firmware project. Written in C, it provides the core functionality for controlling and configuring the keyboard's behavior, including keymapping, lighting, and macro capabilities. This project type is firmware for an embedded system and is likely used by users seeking to customize their mechanical keyboards. The presence of a homepage at qmk.fm suggests integration with a broader keyboard customization ecosystem.
