This archived Objective-C++ project implemented a virtual camera plugin for OBS Studio on macOS, enabling users to stream composited video output as a virtual webcam device to video conferencing applications like Zoom, Google Hangouts, and Jitsi. The plugin utilized macOS CoreMediaIO framework and Device Abstraction Layer (DAL) to create system-level virtual camera drivers that appear as hardware webcams to other applications. Targeted at content creators, streamers, and remote workers, it solved the limitation of feeding processed OBS video streams directly into video chat software without external capture tools. The plugin integrated with OBS Studio's output pipeline to capture rendered scenes and forward them through macOS camera APIs, requiring codesigning workarounds for applications with security restrictions that disable third-party camera plugins.
