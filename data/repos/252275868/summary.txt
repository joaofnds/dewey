This archived project is an Objective-C++ plugin for macOS, designed to create a virtual webcam device from the output of OBS Studio. It enables users to stream composited video from OBS into video conferencing and communication applications like Zoom, Hangouts, and Jitsi, offering a macOS-specific solution akin to the obs-virtualcam plugin. Functionality includes integration with OBS Studio's output and the creation of a virtual camera interface accessible by other macOS applications. This plugin is a standalone extension, now superseded by the built-in virtual camera feature in OBS Studio 26.1+.
