`device-bridge` is a Go-based standalone application designed to link two distinct hardware devices, redirecting input from one device to control the output of another. Its core functionality enables bridging input signals, exemplified by using a keyboard as a MIDI controller. This tool likely targets users needing to interface different hardware devices for control or data transfer purposes, focusing on direct device interaction. The project leverages the Go programming language, implying a focus on system-level programming or cross-platform compatibility.
