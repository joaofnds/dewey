Device-bridge is a Go-based input/output bridging utility that enables cross-device signal routing by connecting the input stream of one hardware device to the output stream of another. Targeting musicians, audio engineers, and hardware enthusiasts, it addresses the problem of device interoperability by facilitating custom signal chains between disparate hardware interfaces. The primary use case involves converting keyboard input signals to MIDI controller output, enabling repurposing of standard input devices for music production workflows. Built in Go for cross-platform compatibility and low-latency performance, this tool serves developers and technical users who need to create custom hardware interface mappings without vendor-specific software limitations or proprietary bridging solutions.
