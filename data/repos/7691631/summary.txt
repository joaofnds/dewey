The Moby Project is a collaborative, open-source initiative providing a modular framework and a "Lego set" of components for building container-based systems. Primarily written in Go, it offers container build tools, a container registry, orchestration tools, and a runtime, enabling developers and integrators to assemble custom container solutions. Moby's architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing for the swapping of components, and focuses on developer-centric APIs. This project serves as an upstream for Docker and other container-focused projects, facilitating experimentation and code reuse within the container ecosystem.
