The Moby Project is a modular containerization toolkit written in Go that serves as the upstream foundation for Docker and other container-based systems. It provides a comprehensive set of building blocks including container runtimes, build tools, registries, and orchestration components that can be assembled into custom containerization platforms. Targeting the DevOps and container infrastructure domain, Moby addresses the need for flexible, swappable container system components rather than monolithic solutions. The project is designed for software engineers, system integrators, and infrastructure developers who need to build, modify, or extend container-based systems at the platform level, offering secure defaults while maintaining modularity for diverse implementation requirements across enterprise and cloud-native environments.
