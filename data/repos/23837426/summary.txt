Duct is a Clojure framework designed for building server-side applications using a data-driven architecture centered around Integrant configurations. It facilitates modular application development by leveraging layered configurations that transform and initiate into a running system. Key features include support for modular extensions via profiles and modules, as well as integration with tools like Leiningen for project creation and development workflows, including ClojureScript compilation. This project functions as a framework, intended for backend Clojure developers.
