Duct is a modular server-side application framework for Clojure that implements data-driven architecture using Integrant as its foundation. It targets web development by providing a two-stage configuration system where configurations are initiated twice - first into intermediate configurations, then into running systems - enabling abstraction of common application patterns through profiles and modules. The framework follows the Twelve-Factor App methodology for production deployments and Stuart Sierra's Reloaded Workflow for development, supporting various extensions like API middleware, PostgreSQL/SQLite databases, ClojureScript compilation, and deployment configurations. Duct is designed for Clojure developers building web applications who prefer immutable configuration-driven architecture over traditional imperative application setup, solving the complexity of managing modular server-side application components through declarative configuration management.
