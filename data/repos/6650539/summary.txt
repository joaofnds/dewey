Neo4j is an open-source graph database management system implemented in Java that stores and queries data as interconnected nodes and relationships rather than traditional relational tables. It targets data engineers, backend developers, and data scientists working with highly connected datasets in domains like fraud detection, recommendation engines, network analysis, and knowledge graphs. The system provides ACID transaction support, the Cypher declarative query language for graph traversals, and can be deployed as either a standalone server or embedded component. Built with Apache Maven, Neo4j addresses performance limitations of relational databases when handling complex relationship queries, offering significant performance improvements for applications requiring deep data connections and pattern matching across large interconnected datasets.
