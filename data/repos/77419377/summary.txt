`ctop` is a command-line monitoring tool written in Go that provides a top-like interface for real-time container metrics visualization. Targeting DevOps engineers and system administrators managing containerized infrastructure, it offers both grid and single-container views for monitoring Docker and runC containers. The tool addresses the need for efficient container resource monitoring by displaying CPU, memory, and network metrics in a terminal-based interface similar to the traditional `top` command. It connects directly to Docker daemon via Docker socket and supports filtering, sorting, and configuration persistence. The application serves the container orchestration and monitoring domain, providing essential observability for containerized workloads without requiring complex monitoring stack deployments, making it particularly valuable for troubleshooting and real-time container performance analysis.
