Flect is a Go-based inflection engine designed for web application development, providing programmatic string manipulation for English noun pluralization, singularization, and text transformation utilities like camelization and capitalization. Built specifically for the GoBuffalo web framework ecosystem, it replaces legacy inflection libraries with a more modular architecture focused on database table naming, model generation, and API response formatting. The library implements configurable inflection rules supporting regular patterns, irregular English nouns, and custom dictionaries via JSON configuration files, targeting Go web developers who need reliable text processing for ORM mapping, REST API development, and database schema generation workflows.
