`gobuffalo/flect` is a Go library providing word inflection capabilities, including singularization, pluralization, capitalization, and other text utility functions. Designed to be modular and easily extensible, it addresses the need for manipulating English words within Go applications, particularly for web development. The library offers core inflection methods and an `Ident` type for custom inflection rule creation, along with a dedicated package for business-oriented inflection rules like name and table name generation. It supports automatic loading of custom inflection dictionaries via `inflections.json` and targets Go developers building applications where text manipulation and word form transformations are required.
