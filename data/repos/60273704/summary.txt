DeepSpeech is an open-source, embedded speech-to-text engine designed for real-time, offline speech recognition on diverse hardware. Built in C++, it leverages deep learning and neural networks, specifically TensorFlow, to perform on-device speech transcription. The project's architecture enables deployment across a wide range of devices, from resource-constrained embedded systems like Raspberry Pi 4 to high-performance GPU servers. This standalone engine provides a core speech-to-text functionality, targeting developers and engineers needing offline speech recognition capabilities.
