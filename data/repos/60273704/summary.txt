Mozilla DeepSpeech is an open-source speech-to-text engine designed for embedded and offline speech recognition applications. Built with C++ and TensorFlow, it implements deep learning neural networks based on Baidu's Deep Speech research to convert audio to text in real-time without internet connectivity. The system targets edge computing scenarios, supporting deployment on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pi 4 through high-performance GPU servers. Primarily serving developers in embedded systems, IoT, and privacy-focused applications, DeepSpeech addresses the need for on-device speech recognition where cloud-based solutions are impractical due to latency, privacy, or connectivity constraints. The framework provides pre-trained models and supports custom model training for domain-specific vocabulary and languages.
