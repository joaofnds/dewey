This repository provides a pre-configured Emacs development environment specifically optimized for Clojure programming. It targets Clojure developers who want a fully-featured IDE experience within Emacs, integrating essential tools like CIDER for interactive REPL-driven development, paredit for structural editing of S-expressions, clojure-lsp for static analysis and language server features, Projectile for project management, Magit for Git integration, and Treemacs for file navigation. The configuration solves the complexity of manually setting up a productive Clojure development workflow by bundling approximately fifty pre-configured packages with sensible defaults. It supports modern Clojure tooling including Leiningen builds, live linting, syntax highlighting, and various search utilities (ripgrep, ag, ack). The setup is designed for both newcomers to Emacs and experienced developers seeking a battle-tested Clojure development configuration.
