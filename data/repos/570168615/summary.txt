This GitHub repository, **DNLHC/glance.nvim**, introduces a Lua-based Neovim extension that offers a VSCode-like peek preview functionality for Language Server Protocol (LSP) locations. The extension, named Glance, enables users to preview, navigate, and edit LSP-provided code locations without leaving their current context.

Key features include seamless integration with LSP for definitions, type definitions, references, and implementations; full editing capabilities within the preview window; smart UI highlighting that adapts to your colorscheme; and an intuitive UI with minimal configuration required. The extension requires a properly configured LSP client and Neovim version 0.9.0 or higher.

Glance can be installed using popular plugin managers such as `lazy.nvim` or `packer.nvim`. It offers customizable keybindings for quick access to its functionalities, ensuring a streamlined user experience. The extension's configuration is flexible, allowing users to adjust the height of the window, whether it floats above all windows or is embedded within the parent window, and various other options.

In essence, Glance is a lightweight, efficient Neovim extension that enhances the development experience by providing a convenient way to preview, navigate, and edit LSP-provided code locations without leaving the current context. It caters to developers who use Neovim as their primary text editor and rely on LSP for their coding needs.
