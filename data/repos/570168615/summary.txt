Glance.nvim is a Lua-based Neovim plugin that provides VSCode-style peek preview functionality for Language Server Protocol (LSP) locations. Targeted at software developers using Neovim as their primary editor, it enables in-context preview and navigation of code definitions, references, type definitions, and implementations without losing current editing context. The plugin integrates seamlessly with any properly configured LSP client, offering a floating preview window with full editing capabilities, customizable keybindings, and intelligent UI theming that adapts to existing colorschemes. It addresses the common developer workflow challenge of efficiently exploring codebases and understanding code relationships while maintaining focus on the current editing task, making it particularly valuable for developers working with large, complex codebases across various programming languages supported by LSP.
