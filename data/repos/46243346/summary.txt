Goji is a minimalistic HTTP request multiplexer and web framework for Go (golang) that serves as an alternative to the standard `net/http.ServeMux`. It provides URL pattern matching, route dispatching to HTTP handlers, and middleware composition for web applications and APIs. The framework integrates with Go's standard `context` package for request-scoped value storage and supports parameterized URL patterns through its `pat` package. Goji targets Go web developers building HTTP services, REST APIs, and web applications who need lightweight routing capabilities with middleware support. It solves the common web development problem of efficiently routing HTTP requests to appropriate handlers while maintaining compatibility with the standard `net/http` ecosystem and providing a more flexible alternative to basic ServeMux functionality.
