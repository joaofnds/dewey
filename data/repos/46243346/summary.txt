Goji is a minimalistic and flexible HTTP request multiplexer library for Go, designed for web application backends. It functions similarly to `net/http.ServeMux`, enabling request routing based on registered patterns and dispatching to corresponding HTTP handlers. Key features include middleware support for composable functionality and integration with Go's `context` package for request-scoped values, offering a flexible architecture for building web applications. This project is a library, providing a modular component for Go developers building HTTP-based services.
