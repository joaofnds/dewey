Evil-snipe is an Emacs Lisp package that implements efficient 2-character text navigation motions for evil-mode, emulating vim-seek and vim-sneak functionality within the Emacs editor. It extends Vim's traditional single-character f/F/t/T movement commands by allowing users to search for two-character combinations with incremental highlighting of potential targets. The package integrates seamlessly with evil-mode's modal editing paradigm, providing configurable search scopes (line, buffer, visible area), character aliasing for regex patterns, and repeat functionality. Targeted at Vim users who have migrated to Emacs but want to retain efficient text navigation capabilities, evil-snipe addresses the limitation of single-character searches in large codebases by enabling more precise cursor positioning with fewer keystrokes, particularly beneficial for software developers working with complex code structures.
