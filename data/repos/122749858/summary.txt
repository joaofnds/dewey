nestjs-config is a TypeScript-based configuration management module designed specifically for NestJS web applications, integrating dotenv functionality for environment-based configuration handling. It enables Node.js backend developers to dynamically load configuration files using glob patterns, supporting multiple environment setups (development, production, staging) through .env file integration. The module addresses the common web development challenge of managing application settings across different deployment environments by providing runtime configuration loading and modification capabilities. Built for the NestJS ecosystem, it targets backend developers building scalable server-side applications who need flexible, environment-aware configuration management without manual file imports, supporting complex project structures with configurable root paths and modular configuration organization.
