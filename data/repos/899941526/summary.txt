**Repository Data:**

**Name:** sinclairtarget/git-who

**Description:** A command-line tool for analyzing Git repository authorship, providing insights into contributions of individual authors and components within a codebase. Unlike traditional `git blame`, which focuses on individual lines of code, `git-who` offers a comprehensive view of file tree contributions.

**Primary function and domain:** Solves the problem of understanding who wrote specific components or subsystems in a Git repository, offering a solution for codebase maintenance and collaboration within software development.

**Core features and capabilities:** Offers three subcommands to provide different views of authorship: `table` (default), which summarizes contributions of every author; `tree`, which displays a hierarchical tree structure of file tree contributions; and `diff`, which shows changes in contributions over time.

**Technology stack:** Written in Go, with dependencies on Ruby and the rake gem for building from source.

**Project type:** Tool

**Target users:** Software developers, maintainers, and contributors working within Git-managed projects who seek to understand authorship patterns and contributions across their codebase.
