`git-who` is a command-line tool written in Go that extends Git's blame functionality to analyze authorship across entire file trees and codebases rather than individual lines. It operates in the software development and version control domain, providing three subcommands: `table` for tabular author contribution summaries, `tree` for hierarchical file tree visualization with authorship annotations, and additional analysis modes. The tool processes Git commit history to identify primary contributors to components, subsystems, or specific paths within repositories, supporting revision ranges, branch filtering, and multiple sorting metrics (commits, lines modified, files touched, chronological). It targets software developers, engineering managers, and technical leads who need to understand code ownership, maintenance responsibilities, and contribution patterns across large codebases for purposes like code reviews, team assignments, or legacy system analysis.
