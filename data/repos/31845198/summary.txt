Trivia is a pattern matching compiler for Common Lisp that serves as a drop-in replacement for the Optima library, targeting functional programming and symbolic computation domains. Built exclusively in Common Lisp with minimal dependencies (Alexandria, lisp-namespace, closer-mop), it provides advanced pattern matching capabilities including destructuring, guards, type checking, array patterns, string parsing, hash table matching, and FSet collection support. The library solves the performance and extensibility limitations of existing pattern matchers by implementing the Balland2006 optimization algorithm, delivering significantly faster compiled patterns while maintaining full backward compatibility. Designed for Common Lisp developers working on compilers, symbolic AI, data transformation, and functional programming applications, Trivia enables declarative pattern-based control flow that simplifies complex conditional logic and data structure manipulation tasks common in language processing and algorithmic programming.
