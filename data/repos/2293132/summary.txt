DRAKMA is an HTTP client library implemented in Common Lisp, providing programmatic web request capabilities for Lisp applications. It serves the web development and system integration domain by enabling Common Lisp developers to perform HTTP operations including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests, handle cookies, manage authentication, and process HTTP responses. The library abstracts low-level networking protocols and HTTP specification complexities, offering a high-level API for consuming REST APIs, web scraping, and building web service integrations. DRAKMA targets Common Lisp developers who need reliable HTTP client functionality for applications ranging from web automation scripts to enterprise integration systems, eliminating the need to implement HTTP protocol handling from scratch while maintaining the functional programming paradigms native to Lisp environments.
