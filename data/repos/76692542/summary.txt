Octobox is a Ruby on Rails web application designed to enhance GitHub user productivity by streamlining and managing GitHub notifications. It provides an "archived" state for notifications, allowing users to mark them as "done" and re-surface them upon new activity, along with features such as starring, enhanced notification details, and advanced filtering and search capabilities. The application offers Gmail-inspired keyboard shortcuts for efficient triage and management.  It functions as a standalone web application and is available via a web extension for Chrome and Firefox, targeting GitHub users who actively manage open-source projects or track multiple GitHub repositories.
