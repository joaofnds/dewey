Turborepo is a high-performance build system written in Rust specifically designed for JavaScript and TypeScript monorepo codebases in web development. It targets frontend and full-stack developers working with large-scale applications that contain multiple packages, libraries, or services within a single repository. The system optimizes build processes through intelligent caching, parallel execution, and dependency graph analysis to reduce build times in complex JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Turborepo addresses the scalability challenges of monorepo architectures where traditional build tools become inefficient as codebases grow, providing developers with faster CI/CD pipelines and local development workflows while maintaining compatibility with existing npm/yarn/pnpm package management ecosystems.
