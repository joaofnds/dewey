Cortex is a Clojure library for machine learning, providing functionalities for neural networks, regression, and feature learning. This project enables users to train machine learning models, including classifiers and regressions, with examples available for MNIST classification. The library utilizes Clojure as its core language, and it leverages libraries like cuDNN for GPU acceleration, as well as potentially using other dependencies. It's a library that aims to facilitate machine learning tasks within the Clojure ecosystem, with ongoing development and features like model saving and future extensions for recurrence and multi-GPU support.
