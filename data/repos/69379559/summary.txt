Cortex is a machine learning library written in Clojure that provides neural networks, regression, and feature learning capabilities for data scientists and Clojure developers. The library focuses on deep learning applications with GPU acceleration support through CUDA and cuDNN integration, enabling efficient training of neural network models including convolutional networks and classifiers. Built by ThinkTopic in collaboration with Mike Anderson, Cortex targets the machine learning and data science domain by offering a functional programming approach to deep learning workflows. The framework supports model serialization, includes MNIST classification examples, and provides compute backends for both CPU and GPU execution. Key use cases include image classification, regression analysis, and training custom neural network architectures within the Clojure ecosystem, making it suitable for teams preferring functional programming paradigms over traditional Python-based ML frameworks.
