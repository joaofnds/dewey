Fasterer is a command-line tool written in Ruby designed to identify and suggest performance improvements for Ruby code. It analyzes Ruby project files, providing recommendations for faster code execution, drawing inspiration from established resources like `fast-ruby`. Key features include identifying slower code patterns, offering specific suggestions to enhance speed, and allowing users to configure suggested improvements via a `.fasterer.yml` configuration file. The project functions as a standalone command-line application targeting Ruby developers seeking to optimize their code's performance. Integrations with tools like pre-commit-hooks, Pronto, and Github Actions extend its utility within broader development workflows.
