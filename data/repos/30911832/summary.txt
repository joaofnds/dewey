Fasterer is a Ruby static analysis command-line tool designed for Ruby developers to identify performance optimization opportunities in Ruby codebases. The tool analyzes Ruby source code and suggests faster alternatives for common programming patterns, such as replacing `Array#select.first` with `Array#detect`, `Hash#keys.each` with `Hash#each_key`, and `gsub` with `tr` for string operations. Built for web development and Ruby application optimization, it supports YAML-based configuration for enabling/disabling specific performance rules and excluding file paths. The tool integrates with development workflows through pre-commit hooks, CI/CD pipelines via Pronto and GitHub Actions, and provides detailed output showing file locations and specific performance improvements. Inspired by the fast-ruby benchmarks and targeted at Ruby developers working on performance-critical applications like web frameworks or high-throughput systems, Fasterer serves as an automated code review tool for identifying micro-optimizations that can collectively improve application performance.
