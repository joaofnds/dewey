ngrok is a reverse proxy service written in Go that creates secure tunnels between local development environments and the public internet. Targeted at web developers and DevOps engineers, it solves the problem of exposing locally-running applications for testing webhooks, sharing development previews, and debugging HTTP traffic without deploying to production servers. The tool functions as a unified ingress solution that combines reverse proxy, firewall, API gateway, and load balancing capabilities, allowing developers to inspect and replay HTTP requests. This archived v1 repository represents the original open-source implementation (2013-2016) that enabled developers to bypass NAT and firewall restrictions for local web service testing and demonstration purposes.
