This archived repository contains the v1 source code for `ngrok`, a globally distributed reverse proxy designed as a unified ingress for developers. Primarily written in Go, it facilitated secure access, protection, and acceleration of applications and network services. Key functionalities included reverse proxy capabilities, an API gateway, and traffic inspection, enabling use cases like webhook testing, developer previews, and site-to-site connectivity. The project served as a standalone application/service accessible via a command-line interface, and was designed for developers to expose local services over the public internet.
