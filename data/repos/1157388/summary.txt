Tmuxinator is a Ruby-based command-line tool that automates the creation and management of complex tmux terminal multiplexer sessions through YAML configuration files. Designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators, it addresses the repetitive task of manually setting up multi-window, multi-pane tmux environments for development workflows. The tool provides project templating capabilities, allowing users to define session layouts with specific directories, commands, and window arrangements that can be instantly recreated. Built as a Ruby gem with shell completion support for bash, zsh, and fish, tmuxinator integrates with existing terminal workflows and supports tmux versions 1.8+ (excluding 2.5). It enables rapid environment bootstrapping for complex development setups, making it particularly valuable for full-stack development, microservices management, and server administration tasks where multiple concurrent terminal sessions are required.
