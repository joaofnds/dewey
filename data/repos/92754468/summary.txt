This Emacs Lisp package provides JavaScript code formatting integration for Emacs editors by interfacing with the Prettier code formatter. Targeting web developers working with JavaScript, JSX, and web templates, it implements a minor mode that automatically formats code using Prettier on file save. The package executes the prettier CLI tool as a subprocess, applies formatting changes via diff operations, and supports customizable CLI arguments for code style configuration. It integrates with popular Emacs modes like js2-mode and web-mode, handles project-specific prettier installations through node_modules, and provides error reporting options. The solution addresses the need for consistent JavaScript code formatting within Emacs-based development workflows, eliminating manual formatting tasks for frontend developers and JavaScript engineers working in Emacs environments.
