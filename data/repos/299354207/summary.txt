RustDesk is an open-source remote desktop application built in Rust that serves as a self-hosted alternative to proprietary solutions like TeamViewer and AnyDesk. The system targets system administrators, IT professionals, and privacy-conscious users who need secure remote access capabilities without relying on third-party servers. It implements peer-to-peer connectivity with custom rendezvous/relay server functionality, supporting multiple platforms through a Flutter-based GUI for cross-platform compatibility (desktop, mobile, web). The application handles video compression using libvpx and libyuv, audio streaming via opus, and integrates with native system APIs for screen capture and input control. RustDesk addresses the enterprise and personal remote support domain by providing full data control, eliminating vendor lock-in, and enabling deployment in air-gapped or security-sensitive environments where external remote desktop services are prohibited.
