Bottom (btm) is a cross-platform terminal-based system monitoring application written in Rust that provides real-time visualization and management of system resources and processes. Targeting system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers, it serves as a modern alternative to traditional Unix tools like htop, top, and gtop. The application features a text-based user interface (TUI) with interactive widgets for monitoring CPU usage per core, memory and swap utilization, network I/O, disk capacity, temperature sensors, and battery status over time with zoom capabilities. It includes advanced process management functionality with kill signals, tree mode visualization, filtering, and search capabilities. Built with Rust for performance and memory safety, bottom officially supports Linux, macOS, and Windows across multiple architectures (x86_64, aarch64, i686) and offers extensive customization through command-line options, configuration files, color themes, and layout modifications, addressing the need for a modern, feature-rich system monitoring solution in terminal environments.
