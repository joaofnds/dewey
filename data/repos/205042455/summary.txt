`bottom` is a cross-platform, terminal-based system and process monitoring application. Written in Rust, it provides a customizable, graphical user interface (TUI) for displaying real-time CPU, RAM, swap, network I/O, disk, temperature, and battery usage statistics, alongside a process list with sorting and searching capabilities.  It supports Linux, macOS, and Windows, and is designed as a standalone CLI application, inspired by tools like `htop` and `gtop`. The project incorporates features like configurable color themes, customizable widget layouts, and is installable via various package managers and through `cargo`.
