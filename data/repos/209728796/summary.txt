Valtan is a Common Lisp to JavaScript transpiler that enables web developers to write client-side applications using Common Lisp syntax and semantics while targeting browser JavaScript execution environments. The compiler supports advanced Common Lisp features including macros, ANSI Common Lisp compatibility testing via sacla test suite, and integrates with modern JavaScript toolchains like webpack for code minification and React for component development. It provides developer productivity features such as source maps for debugging, code obfuscation, and seamless interoperability with existing JavaScript libraries. The project targets functional programming enthusiasts and Lisp developers who want to leverage Common Lisp's expressive power for web frontend development without abandoning the JavaScript ecosystem, offering an alternative compilation path similar to ClojureScript but specifically for Common Lisp.
