John the Ripper is a standalone, command-line application designed for offline password cracking. It supports hundreds of hash and cipher types, including common Unix crypt(3) hashes, Windows LM and NTLM hashes, and various web application and database password hashes. Written in C, the "jumbo" version leverages features like OpenMP, OpenCL, and SIMD for accelerated cracking on CPUs, GPUs, and potentially FPGAs. This project focuses on security auditing and password recovery, allowing users to assess password strength and identify weak credentials.
