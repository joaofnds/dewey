GreptimeDB is an open-source, distributed time-series database written in Rust designed for unified observability data management in DevOps and monitoring domains. It serves as a single storage solution for metrics, logs, and traces, supporting multiple query interfaces including SQL, PromQL, and streaming analytics. The system features a cloud-native architecture with compute-storage separation, columnar storage optimization, and native object storage integration (S3, Azure Blob). Target users include DevOps engineers, SREs, and infrastructure teams who need to consolidate observability data pipelines and achieve sub-second query performance at petabyte scale. It addresses the complexity of managing separate databases for different telemetry data types while providing compatibility with existing monitoring tools and protocols.
