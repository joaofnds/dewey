The json-api/json-api repository contains the official specification documentation for JSON:API, a standardized media type (application/vnd.api+json) that defines conventions for building RESTful JSON APIs. Targeting web developers and API architects, this specification addresses the problem of inconsistent API design patterns by establishing standardized formats for resource representation, relationships, error handling, and pagination in JSON-based web APIs. The repository serves as the source code for jsonapi.org, built using Jekyll static site generation with Markdown documentation files and deployed via GitHub Pages. The specification aims to reduce bikeshedding in API design by providing opinionated defaults for common API patterns, enabling better tooling standardization and client-server communication consistency across web applications and services.
