Komiser is an open-source cloud infrastructure management and cost optimization tool built in Go that provides unified visibility across multiple cloud providers including AWS, Azure, GCP, Digital Ocean, Civo, OCI, Linode, and Tencent Cloud. It serves as a cloud-agnostic resource inspector that analyzes cloud spending, performs security assessments, tracks resource utilization, and manages governance across multi-cloud environments. The tool targets DevOps engineers, SREs, cloud engineers, and platform teams who need to monitor cloud costs, identify idle resources, detect security vulnerabilities, and maintain inventory of cloud assets. Komiser addresses the challenge of cloud sprawl and cost control by providing centralized dashboards and analytics for complex multi-cloud infrastructures, offering both self-hosted deployment options and a managed cloud service.
