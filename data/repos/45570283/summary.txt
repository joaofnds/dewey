Selenized is a carefully engineered color palette project specifically designed for programmers and software developers, serving as an improved alternative to the popular Solarized theme. Built using scientific color theory principles including CIE Lab perceptually uniform color space, it provides optimized syntax highlighting and terminal color schemes that enhance code readability and reduce eye strain. The repository contains ready-to-use configuration files for numerous development tools including terminal emulators (Alacritty, iTerm, Konsole), code editors (Vim, VS Code), and CLI applications (i3, Midnight Commander, Rofi). Targeting the software development domain, it addresses accessibility concerns by improving contrast ratios to meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines while maintaining visual appeal. The project primarily serves developers, system administrators, and anyone who spends significant time reading code in terminal environments or text editors.
