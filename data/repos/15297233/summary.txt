Git-it is a terminal-based interactive tutorial application designed to teach Git version control and GitHub fundamentals to developers and programming students. Built primarily with HTML and likely JavaScript for terminal interaction, this educational tool provides hands-on learning through command-line exercises that guide users through essential Git workflows including repositories, commits, branching, merging, and GitHub collaboration. The application targets software developers, web developers, and computer science students who need to master distributed version control systems for professional development workflows. This original command-line version has been superseded by a desktop Electron application but remains functional for users preferring terminal-based learning environments in the DevOps and software development education domain.
