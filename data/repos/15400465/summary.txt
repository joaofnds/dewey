Hex is the official package manager for the Erlang ecosystem, specifically designed to integrate with Mix, Elixir's build tool. Built in Elixir, it enables developers to discover, install, and manage dependencies for Erlang and Elixir applications through the hex.pm registry. The system handles package resolution, version management, and secure HTTPS communication using bundled Mozilla CA certificates for cryptographic validation. Hex addresses the critical need for standardized dependency management in functional programming environments, particularly for developers building distributed, fault-tolerant systems using the Actor model. It serves Erlang and Elixir developers who require reliable package distribution and version control for libraries and applications in telecommunications, real-time systems, and high-availability web services where the BEAM virtual machine ecosystem is prevalent.
