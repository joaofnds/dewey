Duckling is a Haskell library designed for parsing natural language text into structured data. It provides an engine and tooling for defining, testing, and evaluating composable language rules, enabling the extraction of semantic meaning from text. Key functionalities include identifying and extracting entities like amounts of money, credit card numbers, dates, durations, and quantities. This library is a standalone application, exposing a basic HTTP API for parsing text based on locale and desired dimensions, and targets developers needing to integrate natural language understanding capabilities into their projects, offering support for custom dimensions and extensibility through rule definitions.
