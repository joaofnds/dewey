Duckling is a Haskell-based natural language processing library that parses unstructured text into structured data entities. Built by Facebook, it specializes in extracting semantic information from natural language inputs, converting phrases like "tomorrow at eight" or "3 cups of sugar" into JSON objects with normalized values, units, and metadata. The library supports multiple dimensions including time expressions, monetary amounts, quantities, phone numbers, email addresses, and credit card numbers across various locales. It provides both a programmatic API and HTTP server interface, making it suitable for chatbot developers, NLP engineers, and backend developers building conversational AI systems or text processing pipelines. Duckling addresses the common problem of parsing human-readable text into machine-processable structured formats, particularly valuable for virtual assistants, scheduling applications, and information extraction systems.
