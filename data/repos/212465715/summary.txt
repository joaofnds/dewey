`bufbuild/buf` is a Go-based command-line interface (CLI) designed to improve the workflow for working with Protocol Buffers (Protobuf), an interface definition language (IDL) used for defining APIs and data structures. The tool provides functionalities including linting for API design, breaking change detection, Protobuf code generation via plugins, and formatting capabilities. It integrates with the Buf Schema Registry (BSR) for centralized Protobuf asset management, including dependency management and publishing. The project is a developer productivity tool, specifically targeting developers working with Protobuf to create and manage APIs, aiming to improve reliability and ease of use within a modern Protobuf ecosystem.
