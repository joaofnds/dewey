Buf is a comprehensive CLI toolchain written in Go that modernizes Protocol Buffers (protobuf) development workflows for backend developers and API engineers. It replaces the traditional `protoc` compiler with enhanced tooling including linting for API design standards, breaking change detection for schema evolution, code generation management, and source formatting. The tool integrates with the Buf Schema Registry (BSR) for centralized protobuf dependency management and supports gRPC service development. Targeting distributed systems engineers and microservices developers, Buf addresses the complexity and fragmentation of traditional protobuf tooling by providing a unified, configuration-driven approach to schema-first API development, making Protocol Buffers more accessible and maintainable in production environments.
