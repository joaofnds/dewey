`elegant-emacs` is an Emacs configuration designed to provide a minimal yet visually elegant editing environment. It focuses on consistent styling and utilizes Emacs Lisp to customize the editor's appearance, notably employing the Roboto Mono font. Functionality includes a custom setup, deployable by loading `sanity.el` and `elegance.el` and providing example `Splash.org` files, serving as a proof-of-concept or example of Emacs theming. This project is a configuration/theme, effectively acting as a developer productivity tool, and presents an alternative aesthetic, suitable for Emacs users.
