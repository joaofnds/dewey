Casbin is an open-source authorization library written in Go that implements multiple access control models including ACL (Access Control Lists), RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control). Targeting enterprise web development and cloud security domains, it provides a policy-based authorization engine that evaluates user permissions through configurable policy files and model definitions. The library integrates with existing Go applications to handle complex authorization scenarios, supporting features like hierarchical roles, domain-specific permissions, and custom policy matching functions. Primarily used by backend developers and security engineers building scalable web applications, microservices, and API gateways that require fine-grained access control beyond simple authentication, addressing the critical need for standardized authorization management in distributed systems.
