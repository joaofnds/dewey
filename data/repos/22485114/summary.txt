HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a Go-based toolkit for creating structured configuration languages that balance human readability with machine parsing efficiency, specifically targeting DevOps tools and server applications. It provides both a native syntax inspired by nginx configuration and libucl, plus JSON compatibility for machine generation. The library implements a declarative configuration model built around attributes and blocks, offering high-level APIs for parsing, validation, and Go struct binding, alongside lower-level APIs for custom parsing logic. HCL supports expression evaluation, variables, and functions, enabling dynamic configuration scenarios. It's primarily used by infrastructure engineers and DevOps practitioners building command-line tools and server configurations that require more structure than JSON/YAML but less complexity than full programming languages.
