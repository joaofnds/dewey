GB Studio is a cross-platform game development tool built with Electron and TypeScript that enables visual creation of retro adventure games for the Game Boy handheld console. The system combines a drag-and-drop GUI builder with a C-based game engine utilizing GBDK (Game Boy Development Kit) to compile projects into authentic Game Boy ROM files. It targets indie game developers and retro gaming enthusiasts who want to create Game Boy-compatible games without low-level assembly programming knowledge. The tool provides CLI functionality for automated builds, supports multiple export formats including ROM files, web builds, and Analogue Pocket formats, and handles the complete development pipeline from visual scripting to final ROM generation. The codebase integrates modern web technologies with legacy Game Boy hardware constraints to bridge contemporary development workflows with 8-bit game creation.
