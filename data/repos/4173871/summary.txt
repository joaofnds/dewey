Ring is a Clojure library providing an abstraction layer for building web applications by unifying HTTP server interactions. Inspired by WSGI and Rack, it defines a consistent API for handling HTTP requests and responses, enabling modular components that can be shared across various web servers and frameworks. The library offers core functionalities, middleware, and adapters for integrating with servers like Jetty and Java Servlets, and provides utilities for development and debugging Clojure web applications. It functions as a library for Clojure developers and provides both core components and extensions for building web applications.
