Ring is a foundational HTTP server abstraction library for Clojure web development, inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack specifications. It provides a unified API that abstracts HTTP request/response handling into simple Clojure data structures (maps), enabling modular web application construction through composable middleware and handlers. The library includes core protocols for HTTP and WebSocket communication, servlet adapters for Java/Jakarta EE integration, a Jetty web server adapter, and development utilities. Ring serves as the underlying foundation for most Clojure web frameworks and applications, allowing web developers to build server-side applications with functional programming principles while maintaining compatibility across different web servers and deployment environments.
