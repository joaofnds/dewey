docopt-go is a Go implementation of the docopt command-line argument parsing library that automatically generates argument parsers from usage documentation strings. Targeting CLI application developers and DevOps engineers, it eliminates the need to manually write argument parsing code by analyzing help message formats and extracting command structure, options, and parameters. The library provides three API levels: simple ParseDoc(), configurable ParseArgs(), and custom Parser instances with controllable help handlers and parsing behavior. It returns parsed arguments as key-value maps with type conversion helpers for booleans and integers, plus struct binding capabilities using Go struct tags. This approach addresses the common problem of maintaining separate argument parsing logic and help documentation in command-line tools, ensuring consistency between usage messages and actual program behavior while reducing boilerplate code in Go CLI applications.
