**vim-gitgutter** is a Vim/Neovim plugin that provides real-time Git diff visualization and hunk management directly within the editor interface. Written in Vim Script, it displays Git diff markers in the sign column showing added, modified, and removed lines, while offering interactive capabilities to preview, stage, and undo individual hunks or partial hunks. The plugin runs Git diffs asynchronously, integrates with Vim's quickfix system, provides hunk text objects for navigation, and supports customizable sign column indicators and line highlighting. Targeted at software developers and DevOps engineers working in Git-based version control workflows, it solves the problem of context-switching between editor and terminal for Git operations, enabling efficient code review and staging workflows directly within Vim/Neovim environments without requiring buffer saves or external Git GUI tools.
