Figwheel Main is a ClojureScript development tooling framework that provides live code reloading and REPL-driven development for web applications. Targeting ClojureScript developers in the web development domain, it automatically rebuilds and hot-reloads code changes in the browser without page refreshes, maintaining application state during development. The tool integrates a static file server, CSS/JavaScript live reloading, heads-up display for compilation errors, and an interactive ClojureScript REPL that connects to running applications. It supports both browser and Node.js environments, handles dependency management, and broadcasts changes to multiple connected clients simultaneously. Figwheel Main solves the slow feedback loop problem in ClojureScript web development by enabling immediate visual feedback and interactive programming workflows for frontend developers building single-page applications and web interfaces.
