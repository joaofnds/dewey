RuboCop RSpec is a Ruby gem providing static analysis and code style checking specifically for RSpec test files. As a RuboCop extension, it integrates into existing Ruby projects to enforce consistent style and best practices within RSpec test suites. The gem analyzes RSpec-specific code constructs, offering "cops" that can be configured to detect and enforce coding standards, with integration options including `.rubocop.yml` configuration files, command-line execution, and Rake tasks. This plugin targets Ruby developers who write RSpec tests and use RuboCop for code quality.
