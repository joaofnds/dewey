`yasnippet` is an Emacs Lisp-based template system designed to enhance text editing productivity within the Emacs environment. It provides a framework for defining and utilizing text snippets, enabling users to rapidly insert pre-defined text blocks, code fragments, or complex structures. This functionality facilitates code completion, reduces repetitive typing, and promotes consistency in coding styles. The project functions as an Emacs extension/plugin, integrated directly into the Emacs editor.
