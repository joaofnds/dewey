vim-wakatime is a Vim Script plugin that provides automatic time tracking and programming activity metrics for developers using Vim, Neovim, MacVim, and gVim editors. The plugin integrates with the WakaTime service to passively monitor coding sessions, capturing data on files edited, languages used, and time spent programming without manual intervention. It supports multiple plugin managers including Vundle, Pathogen, Vim-plug, Packer, and Lazy.nvim, and automatically downloads the wakatime-cli binary for data transmission. The plugin addresses the developer productivity and project management domain by solving the problem of manual time tracking for software engineers, freelancers, and development teams who need accurate coding activity reports. It targets programmers across all development disciplines who use Vim-based editors and require automated productivity insights and billing documentation.
