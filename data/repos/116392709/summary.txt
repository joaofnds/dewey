**nginxconfig.io** is a web-based NGINX configuration generator built with Vue.js, Bulma CSS framework, and Prism syntax highlighting that automates the creation of production-ready NGINX server configurations. Targeting web developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators in the web hosting and server management domain, it generates optimized configs for complex scenarios including HTTPS/TLS termination, HTTP/2, reverse proxying, load balancing, PHP-FPM integration, CDN setup, security headers, rate limiting, and CMS-specific configurations for WordPress, Drupal, and Magento. The tool addresses the complexity of manually crafting NGINX configurations by providing an interactive interface that translates user inputs into syntactically correct, security-hardened NGINX directives, eliminating configuration errors and reducing deployment time for web server setups.
