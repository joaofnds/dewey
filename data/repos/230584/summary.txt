Twittering-mode is an Emacs Lisp major mode that transforms Emacs into a full-featured Twitter client for developers and power users who prefer text-based interfaces. It provides comprehensive Twitter functionality including timeline viewing (home, replies, favorites, retweets), tweet composition, direct messaging, user following, and tweet favoriting directly within the Emacs editor environment. The mode leverages Twitter's REST API v1.1 with OAuth authentication, supports HTTPS connections via cURL/wget/OpenSSL/GnuTLS, uses JSON parsing for API responses, and integrates GnuPG for secure token storage. Additional features include HTTP proxy support, icon display via ImageMagick, and timeline customization. This tool addresses the workflow needs of Emacs-centric developers who want to manage social media without leaving their primary development environment.
