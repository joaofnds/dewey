i3-gaps is a C-based fork of the i3 tiling window manager for X11/Linux desktop environments, specifically targeting system administrators, power users, and Linux enthusiasts who require advanced window management capabilities. Built using XCB (X protocol C-language Binding) and integrated with Xorg display server architecture, it extends the core i3wm functionality by adding configurable gaps between windows, smart borders, and enhanced i3bar customization features. The project addresses the desktop customization and workflow optimization needs of users who prefer keyboard-driven, tile-based window layouts over traditional floating window managers. Key technologies include X11 protocol implementation, XCB for low-level X server communication, and C-based system programming for performance-critical window management operations, serving the Linux desktop user community seeking aesthetic and functional improvements to their tiling window manager setup.
