This repository is a fork of the i3 window manager, a tiling window manager for the X11 windowing system. It is written in C and implements features not present in the original i3, most notably "gaps" that add configurable spacing between windows and screen edges, enhancing visual customization. Functionality also includes smart borders, smart gaps, bar height configuration, and smart edge borders. This project is a standalone application, specifically a window manager, intended for users seeking a highly configurable and efficient desktop environment.
