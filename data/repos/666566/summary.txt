Suspenders is a Ruby on Rails engine that provides opinionated application templates and generators for rapidly bootstrapping Rails web applications with thoughtbot's standard configuration defaults. Built for Rails 8.0+ and Ruby 3.1+, it automates the setup of development tooling including RSpec for testing (replacing default Rails test framework), PostgreSQL database configuration, linting rules, and other production-ready conventions. The tool functions both as an application template for new Rails projects and as a gem for enhancing existing applications through individual generators. Targeting Rails developers and development teams, Suspenders addresses the repetitive configuration overhead in Rails application setup by codifying best practices into reusable generators, enabling faster project initialization with battle-tested conventions for web application development.
