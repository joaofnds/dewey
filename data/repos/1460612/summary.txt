Cowboy is a production-ready HTTP server implementation written in Erlang/OTP, designed for building high-performance web applications and APIs in the Erlang ecosystem. It provides a complete HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 stack with WebSocket support, request routing, and REST capabilities, optimized for low latency and minimal memory usage through binary string handling. Built on Ranch for connection management, Cowboy enables embedded deployment within larger Erlang applications and supports HTTPS, making it suitable for scalable concurrent web services. The framework targets Erlang developers building web backends, microservices, and real-time applications who require fault-tolerant, concurrent HTTP server functionality with the performance characteristics of the actor model and functional programming paradigms inherent to Erlang/OTP.
