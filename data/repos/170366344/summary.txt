Ristretto is a high-performance, memory-bound caching library for Go applications designed to solve contention issues in concurrent systems. Built originally for Dgraph database operations, it implements advanced cache eviction algorithms including SampledLFU for eviction and TinyLFU for admission control, achieving superior hit ratios compared to traditional LRU caches. The library features cost-based eviction, full concurrency support across goroutines, and optional performance metrics collection. It supports both v1.x (legacy) and v2.x (generics-enabled) versions and is production-ready for backend developers building high-throughput Go services, databases, and web applications requiring efficient in-memory caching with minimal lock contention and optimal memory utilization across search, database, and enterprise workloads.
