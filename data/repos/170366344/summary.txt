Ristretto is a high-performance, memory-bound caching library written in Go, designed for concurrent use cases. It provides a key-value cache with features like sampled Least Frequently Used (LFU) eviction, TinyLFU admission policy, and cost-based eviction to optimize hit ratios and throughput.  This library supports a fully concurrent architecture suitable for multi-goroutine applications and includes optional metrics for performance monitoring.  Ristretto is intended to be integrated as a library into Go projects needing efficient in-memory data caching, as evidenced by its use in projects like Badger and Dgraph.
