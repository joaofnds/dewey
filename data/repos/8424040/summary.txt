p5.js is a client-side JavaScript creative coding library that provides a simplified API for artists, designers, educators, and students to create interactive graphics, animations, and multimedia experiences in web browsers. Built on HTML5 Canvas and WebGL, it abstracts complex graphics programming into intuitive functions for drawing, animation, user interaction, and audio-visual processing. The library serves the creative technology and digital arts education domain, offering an accessible entry point to programming through visual feedback. It extends the Processing programming environment's philosophy to JavaScript, enabling creative practitioners to develop generative art, interactive installations, data visualizations, and educational coding projects without requiring deep technical graphics programming knowledge, while supporting community-contributed libraries for extended functionality.
