This repository implements a minimalist NTP (Network Time Protocol) client designed for system administration and network operations. The client operates directly at the NTP protocol level per RFC 958 without relying on external NTP libraries, providing raw protocol implementation for time synchronization queries. It includes dual implementations in both C and Python, targeting different NTP server pools (us.pool.ntp.org and pool.ntp.org respectively). Unlike production tools like ntpdate, this client focuses on time retrieval rather than system clock adjustment, making it suitable for network diagnostics, time synchronization testing, and educational purposes. The implementation targets system administrators, network engineers, and developers working with time-sensitive applications who need lightweight NTP functionality or want to understand low-level NTP protocol mechanics without the complexity of full-featured NTP clients.
