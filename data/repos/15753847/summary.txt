The `ntpclient` repository provides a standalone NTP client, implemented in both C and Python, for querying time servers. Functionality mirrors `ntpdate`, without command-line argument parsing or system clock modification, directly interacting with the NTP protocol as defined in RFC958. The C version utilizes `us.pool.ntp.org` while the Python version employs `pool.ntp.org` as default time servers. This project represents standalone applications, focusing on precise time synchronization and network time protocol implementation for system administration and potentially embedded systems applications.
