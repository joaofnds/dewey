`fantasy-land/fantasy-land` is a JavaScript specification defining interoperability for common algebraic structures within the functional programming paradigm. This library outlines specifications for algebraic structures such as Setoid, Functor, Monad, and others, using methods like `equals`, `map`, and `chain`. It leverages JavaScript's prototype-based object model for specifying these interfaces, providing a foundation for consistent algebraic behavior across functional libraries and serving as a specification, not a specific implementation. It is a library aimed at developers building functional JavaScript libraries.
