Fantasy Land is a JavaScript specification that defines standardized interfaces for functional programming algebraic structures, enabling interoperability between functional programming libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem. Targeting web developers and functional programming practitioners, it establishes formal contracts for common mathematical abstractions like Functors, Monads, Semigroups, and Monoids through method signatures and algebraic laws. The specification uses category theory principles to define composable, lawful interfaces that JavaScript libraries can implement, allowing developers to write generic functional code that works across different implementations. This solves the fragmentation problem in JavaScript's functional programming landscape by providing a common vocabulary and behavior expectations for algebraic data types, similar to Haskell's type classes but adapted for JavaScript's dynamic nature.
