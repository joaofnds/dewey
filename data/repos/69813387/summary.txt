Fusuma is a Ruby-based multitouch gesture recognition tool for Linux systems that enables touchpad gesture customization through the libinput driver. It captures low-level input events from `/dev/input/` devices and translates multitouch gestures (swipes, pinches) into configurable system actions defined in YAML configuration files. The tool targets Linux desktop users and system administrators who want to implement macOS-like gesture controls on laptops and touchpad devices. It integrates with X11 through xdotool for sending keyboard shortcuts and window management commands, while supporting plugin architecture for extensibility. Fusuma solves the problem of limited native gesture support in Linux desktop environments by providing a flexible, configuration-driven approach to touchpad gesture recognition and action mapping.
