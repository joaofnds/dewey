Flycheck is a real-time syntax checking and linting extension for GNU Emacs written in Emacs Lisp. It provides on-the-fly error detection and code quality analysis across multiple programming languages by integrating with external syntax checkers, linters, and static analysis tools. The system operates as a minor mode that automatically validates code as developers type, displaying errors, warnings, and style violations directly in the editor buffer with visual indicators. Flycheck supports dozens of programming languages and tools including ESLint, Pylint, GCC, Rust compiler, and many others through a pluggable checker architecture. It targets software developers working in multi-language environments who need immediate feedback on code quality, syntax errors, and style compliance without leaving their Emacs editing workflow, serving as a comprehensive IDE-like development experience within the text editor.
