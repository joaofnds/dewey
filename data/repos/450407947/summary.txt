Fidget.nvim is a Neovim plugin written in Lua that provides an extensible notification UI system specifically for displaying LSP (Language Server Protocol) progress messages and general editor notifications. Targeting software developers using Neovim as their primary editor, it renders a non-intrusive corner window that shows real-time feedback from language servers during operations like indexing, building, or analyzing code. The plugin integrates with Neovim's built-in LSP client and `vim.notify()` API, supporting ASCII animations and configurable display options for progress indicators. It addresses the common developer pain point of lack of visual feedback during long-running LSP operations, particularly beneficial for languages with heavy analysis phases like Rust, TypeScript, or C++, enhancing the development experience by providing clear status communication without cluttering the main editor interface.
