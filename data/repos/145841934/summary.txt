Kimurai is a Ruby-based web scraping framework designed for extracting data from websites, including those rendered with JavaScript, by integrating with headless browsers like Chromium/Firefox and PhantomJS, as well as supporting simple HTTP requests. This framework provides functionalities such as Capybara integration for page interaction, flexible configuration options for headers, cookies, and proxy rotation, and built-in helpers for data saving and duplicate detection. Kimurai is structured as a framework and offers both single-file spider creation and a Scrapy-like project mode, enabling parallel crawling, scheduling via Cron, and automated server setup and deployment capabilities, targeting Ruby developers who need tools for web data extraction.
