Kimurai is a Ruby-based web scraping framework designed for extracting data from JavaScript-rendered websites using headless browser automation. Built on Capybara and Nokogiri, it supports multiple browser engines including Selenium Chrome/Firefox, PhantomJS, and HTTP requests to handle dynamic content that traditional scrapers cannot access. The framework provides a spider-based architecture with configurable user agents, request delays, and automatic pagination handling for large-scale data extraction tasks. It outputs structured data in formats like JSON and targets data engineers, web developers, and data scientists who need to scrape modern single-page applications and Ajax-heavy websites. Kimurai addresses the limitations of simple HTTP scrapers when dealing with client-side rendered content by providing full browser automation capabilities within a Ruby ecosystem.
