Offering a command-line interface, integrations for various editors and build tools, and configurable output formats, including HTML, YAML, JSON, and GitHub-compatible reports, Reek is a developer productivity tool intended for Ruby developers focused on improving code quality and maintainability through static analysis.  It is a standalone command-line application and a library, usable as a Rake task or within RSpec tests.
