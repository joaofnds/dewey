Reek is a static analysis tool for Ruby developers that automatically detects and reports code smells in Ruby codebases. Built specifically for the Ruby software development ecosystem, it analyzes Ruby classes, modules, and methods to identify maintainability issues such as feature envy, uncommunicative variable names, long parameter lists, and other anti-patterns that degrade code quality. The tool integrates into development workflows through command-line interfaces, supports multiple output formats, and offers extensive configuration options including YAML-based configuration files and inline code comments for smell suppression. Targeting Ruby developers working on any scale of application from small scripts to large Rails applications, Reek serves as a linting and quality assurance tool that helps maintain clean, readable code by providing actionable feedback on structural problems and design issues within Ruby source code.
