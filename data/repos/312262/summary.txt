Vimium is a cross-browser extension built in JavaScript that transforms web browsing by implementing Vim-style keyboard navigation and control. Targeting web power users, developers, and system administrators familiar with Vim editor paradigms, it eliminates mouse dependency through comprehensive keybindings for scrolling, tab management, link navigation, history traversal, and URL manipulation. The extension supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers, offering customizable key mappings, visual selection modes, find functionality with regex support, and advanced features like marks and multi-link opening. It addresses the inefficiency of mouse-based web navigation by providing a keyboard-centric interface that mirrors Vim's modal editing philosophy, enabling rapid web browsing workflows for technical users who prioritize speed and keyboard efficiency over traditional point-and-click interactions.
