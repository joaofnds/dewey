Auto-M4B is a Docker-based automation tool for audiobook processing that monitors filesystem directories and converts multi-file MP3 audiobooks into chapterized M4B format. Built with Shell scripting and leveraging the m4b-tool library, it implements a file-watching workflow that automatically processes books from input directories, performs audio format conversion with chapter generation based on individual MP3 tracks, and outputs standardized M4B files for downstream tagging systems. The container targets digital media enthusiasts and home server administrators managing audiobook libraries, providing automated preprocessing between acquisition and metadata tagging workflows. It integrates with the beets.io audible plugin ecosystem and supports ARM architecture deployments, addressing the common problem of inconsistent audiobook file formats in personal media collections through containerized batch processing.
