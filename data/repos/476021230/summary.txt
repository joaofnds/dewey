`auto-m4b` is a Docker container application designed to automate the conversion of multi-file MP3 audiobooks into chapterized M4B format. Operating within the audiobook domain, it monitors a specified input folder for new MP3, M4A, or OGG files, utilizes `m4b-tool` for conversion, and outputs the resulting M4B files to a designated untagged folder. The project leverages Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and orchestration, employing Shell scripting to manage file movement and trigger conversions, with a configuration via YAML compose file. The primary functionality revolves around a command-line interface for converting and pre-processing audiobooks.
