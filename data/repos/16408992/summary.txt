Neovim is a refactoring of the Vim text editor focused on enhanced extensibility and usability, serving as a developer productivity tool. It provides a core text editing engine with a modern API accessible from various languages (C, Lua, Python, etc.), enabling the creation of advanced graphical user interfaces and plugins. Key features include an embedded terminal emulator, asynchronous job control, and support for Vim plugin compatibility, operating as a standalone application with extensive configuration options and a focus on customizability for developers. The project is built primarily in C and Lua, indicating a systems-level and scripting focus, and targets developers who use and extend text editors as part of their workflow.
