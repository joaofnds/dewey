Neovim is a modernized fork of the Vim text editor built primarily in C with Vim Script and Lua scripting support, targeting software developers and system administrators across all programming domains. It provides an extensible terminal-based text editing environment with enhanced features including asynchronous job control, embedded terminal emulation, multi-language API access via RPC/msgpack, and improved plugin architecture. The project refactors Vim's codebase using CMake build system to enable advanced UI development, better maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility while preserving Vim plugin compatibility. Key technical improvements include event-loop architecture, XDG directory standards compliance, shared data persistence, and native Lua integration for configuration and scripting, making it suitable for developers working in any programming language or technical field requiring powerful text manipulation capabilities.
