imgdiff is a high-performance command-line image comparison tool written in Go, designed for pixel-by-pixel difference detection between images. Targeting web developers, QA engineers, and automated testing workflows, it serves as a faster alternative to existing visual regression testing tools like odiff. The tool generates visual diff outputs highlighting pixel-level changes between baseline and comparison images, supporting configurable color difference thresholds and layout validation options. Primarily used in CI/CD pipelines for automated visual testing, screenshot comparison, and UI regression detection, imgdiff processes large images (4K+ resolution) significantly faster than competing solutions, making it suitable for high-throughput testing environments where visual accuracy verification is critical for web applications and digital interfaces.
