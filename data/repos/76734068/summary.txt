Renovate is a TypeScript-based automated dependency management tool designed for DevOps and software development workflows. It systematically scans code repositories across platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps) to detect outdated dependencies in over 90 package managers including npm, Maven, pip, NuGet, and Docker. The CLI tool automatically generates pull requests with dependency updates, providing metadata like adoption rates and merge confidence to aid decision-making. Built for developers and DevOps engineers, it integrates with CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions, GitLab Runners, and custom automation, while supporting both public and private package registries. The tool addresses the critical maintenance burden of keeping software dependencies current and secure across multi-language, multi-platform development environments.
