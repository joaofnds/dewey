Denops.vim is a plugin ecosystem that enables developers to write cross-platform Vim and Neovim plugins using TypeScript/JavaScript powered by the Deno runtime. Targeting text editor extension developers in the development tools domain, it solves the traditional limitation of writing Vim plugins in Vimscript by providing a modern JavaScript/TypeScript development environment with Deno's security model and standard library. The system uses a client-server architecture where Deno processes communicate with Vim/Neovim instances via RPC, supporting both standalone and shared server modes for improved performance. It includes comprehensive APIs for editor manipulation, supports hot reloading, and provides tooling for plugin development, making modern web development practices accessible to Vim plugin authors while maintaining compatibility across both Vim and Neovim editors.
