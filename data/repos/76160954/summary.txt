Joker is a lightweight Clojure interpreter, linter, and code formatter implemented in Go, designed specifically for scripting and development tooling use cases. It targets Clojure/ClojureScript developers who need fast startup times for scripting tasks, static code analysis, and code formatting - areas where the JVM-based Clojure ecosystem falls short. The tool provides a REPL environment, script execution capabilities, recursive directory linting for Clojure codebases, and pretty-printing functionality for Clojure/EDN data structures. Built with Go's runtime for performance and cross-platform distribution, Joker implements core Clojure language features including persistent data structures, macros, and namespaces, while omitting JVM-specific functionality like interop, multithreading primitives, and advanced features like protocols and transducers. It serves development workflow automation, CI/CD integration, and rapid prototyping scenarios where traditional Clojure's startup overhead is prohibitive.
