Kredis is a Ruby library providing higher-level data structures built upon Redis for use within Rails applications. It offers typed scalars (strings, integers, decimals, etc.) and data structures like lists, sets, and counters, simplifying interaction with Redis as coherent objects configured declaratively within Active Models and Active Records.  Kredis supports namespacing and configuration via YAML files, enabling the location of data structures on separate Redis instances. The library is designed for Ruby developers building applications that require efficient data storage and retrieval using Redis, offering a more object-oriented interface to common Redis operations and data types.
