`libqalculate` is a C++ library and command-line interface (CLI) for a multi-purpose calculator, providing extensive mathematical capabilities. Key features include a wide range of functions (trigonometry, calculus, statistics), unit conversions, symbolic calculations (equations, differentiation, integration), arbitrary precision, uncertainty propagation, interval arithmetic, and plotting functionality using Gnuplot. It targets users needing a versatile tool for scientific computing, unit conversions, and general mathematical problem-solving, with dependencies on GMP, MPFR, libxml2, and optionally libcurl, icu, gettext, iconv, readline, and Gnuplot. This project comprises a library and a standalone CLI application.
