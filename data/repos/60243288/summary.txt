libqalculate is a C++ mathematical computation library that provides advanced calculator functionality with symbolic algebra, arbitrary precision arithmetic, and unit conversion capabilities. Built on GMP/MPFR for high-precision mathematics and libxml2 for data handling, it targets scientific computing, engineering, and educational domains where complex mathematical operations are required. The library supports interval arithmetic, uncertainty propagation, matrix operations, equation solving, calculus (differentiation/integration), and multi-base number systems including complex numbers. It serves as the core engine for desktop calculator applications (GTK+, Qt) and integrates with scientific software like KDE Plasma and Cantor, providing both CLI interface and API for developers building mathematical computation tools, CAD applications, and educational software requiring robust symbolic and numerical calculation capabilities.
