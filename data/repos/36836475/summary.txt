The `tmux/tmux` repository contains the source code for tmux, a terminal multiplexer. It enables users to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single terminal window, allowing for session persistence, detaching and reattaching sessions, and split-window capabilities. Written in C, this standalone application provides a command-line interface for managing terminal environments, targeting system administrators and developers to enhance command-line workflow and productivity.
