tmux is a terminal multiplexer written in C that enables creation, management, and control of multiple terminal sessions from a single screen interface. Built on libevent for asynchronous I/O and ncurses for terminal handling, it primarily serves system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers who need persistent terminal sessions that can be detached and reattached across SSH connections or system reboots. The application runs on Unix-like systems (Linux, BSD variants, macOS, Solaris) and solves the critical problem of maintaining long-running terminal processes and workflows when remote connections are interrupted. It supports session sharing, window splitting, and background execution, making it essential infrastructure tooling for server administration, development environments, and remote system management workflows.
