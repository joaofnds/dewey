Serde is a high-performance serialization and deserialization framework for Rust that provides generic traits and derive macros for converting Rust data structures to and from various data formats including JSON, YAML, TOML, MessagePack, and binary formats. It serves as the foundational serialization layer for Rust applications across domains including web development, API services, configuration management, data processing, and systems programming. The framework leverages Rust's type system and zero-cost abstractions to enable compile-time code generation through procedural macros, supporting no-std environments for embedded development. Serde solves the critical problem of type-safe, efficient data interchange between Rust programs and external systems, databases, or network protocols, making it essential infrastructure for Rust developers building distributed systems, web services, CLI tools, and data processing applications.
