Serde is a Rust library providing a generic framework for efficiently serializing and deserializing Rust data structures. Its core functionality enables converting complex data types to and from various formats, including JSON, through the use of derive macros and traits like `Serialize` and `Deserialize`. This framework is designed for use in applications where data exchange and persistence are critical, such as configuration management or data transmission. It is a Rust library and supports the `no-std` environment, making it suitable for a broad range of use cases, from desktop applications to embedded systems.
