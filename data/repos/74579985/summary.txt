Websocat is a command-line WebSocket client and server tool written in Rust that provides netcat/socat-like functionality for WebSocket connections (RFC 6455). It enables system administrators and developers to establish WebSocket connections, proxy between TCP and WebSocket protocols, serve WebSocket endpoints, and integrate WebSocket communication into shell scripts and automation workflows. The tool supports advanced features including SOCKS5 proxying, SSL/TLS connections, binary and text message handling, auto-reconnection, UNIX socket integration, and protocol bridging capabilities. Targeting DevOps engineers, network administrators, and backend developers, websocat solves the problem of WebSocket protocol interaction from command-line environments, enabling debugging, testing, and automation of WebSocket-based applications without requiring custom client code.
