`websocat` is a command-line tool written in Rust, functioning as a client and server for WebSockets, offering functionality akin to `netcat` or `curl` for `ws://` and `wss://` connections, with advanced features similar to `socat`.  It enables connecting to and serving WebSockets, supports executing external programs via stdin/stdout for WebSocket communication, and provides text/binary message handling with options like line-to-message conversions. Key features include proxying TCP connections to WebSockets, broadcasting messages between clients, and supporting various modes such as inetd and UNIX socket integration, alongside support for TLS connections, SOCKS5 proxying, and pre-built binaries for multiple operating systems. This is a standalone CLI application intended for system administrators, developers, and network engineers for debugging, proxying, and manipulating WebSocket connections from the command line.
