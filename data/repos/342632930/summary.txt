This repository provides a CDK-based infrastructure-as-code solution for deploying Backstage, Spotify's developer portal platform, on AWS using containerized architecture. Targeting DevOps engineers and platform teams, it automates the deployment of Backstage instances using AWS Fargate (ECS) for container orchestration, Aurora PostgreSQL for data persistence, and Application Load Balancers for traffic management. The solution implements GitOps practices through AWS CodePipeline for continuous deployment, featuring self-updating infrastructure pipelines and automated container image builds triggered by source code changes. Written in Python using AWS CDK, it addresses the challenge of establishing scalable, production-ready Backstage deployments in AWS environments, eliminating manual infrastructure provisioning and enabling teams to focus on developer experience rather than infrastructure management.
