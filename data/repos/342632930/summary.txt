This repository provides a CDK application written in Python for deploying a containerized Backstage instance on AWS Fargate (ECS) with an Aurora PostgreSQL database. It automates the infrastructure provisioning and application deployment for Backstage, using two independent pipelines: one for infrastructure updates and one for the Backstage application container. Key features include integration with AWS services like ECS, Aurora, and CodePipeline, along with infrastructure-as-code management for self-updating and self-healing capabilities, and a custom domain setup. This is an infrastructure-as-code template project for DevOps engineers and developers managing internal developer platforms.
