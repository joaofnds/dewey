JSONAPI::Resources is a Ruby gem that provides a resource-focused framework for building JSON:API compliant REST API servers in Rails applications. Designed for Rails 5.1+, it automatically generates routes, controllers, and serializers based on resource definitions that specify attributes and relationships, eliminating much of the boilerplate code typically required for API development. The library can work with ActiveRecord models or custom objects as data sources, providing a declarative approach to creating standardized JSON:API responses including proper handling of resource relationships, pagination, filtering, and sorting. It targets Rails developers building modern web APIs who need to conform to the JSON:API specification while maintaining clean, maintainable code architecture.
