libuv is a cross-platform C library providing asynchronous I/O primitives for high-performance network and system programming. It serves as the foundational I/O layer for Node.js and other runtime environments, abstracting platform-specific event loop mechanisms (epoll on Linux, kqueue on BSD/macOS, IOCP on Windows) behind a unified API. The library offers asynchronous TCP/UDP sockets, DNS resolution, file system operations, child process management, threading primitives, and inter-process communication capabilities. Targeting systems programmers and runtime developers, libuv solves the complexity of writing portable, event-driven applications across Unix-like systems and Windows. It enables building scalable network servers and I/O-intensive applications by providing non-blocking operations with callback-based concurrency models, making it essential infrastructure for JavaScript runtimes, web servers, and other performance-critical applications requiring efficient asynchronous I/O handling.
