libuv is a cross-platform C library providing asynchronous I/O capabilities. Designed primarily for Node.js, it offers a full-featured event loop backed by various platform-specific implementations, supporting asynchronous TCP/UDP sockets, DNS resolution, file system operations, IPC, child processes, threading primitives, and signal handling. This library enables event-driven programming for high-performance networking and system-level tasks, making it a crucial component for applications demanding asynchronous I/O across diverse operating systems including Unix-like systems, Windows, AIX, and z/OS. It is a foundational library that is intended to be used by other applications and developers.
