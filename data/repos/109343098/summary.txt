This repository serves as a curated directory of open-source macOS applications, functioning as an "awesome list" resource for the macOS developer and user community. It systematically categorizes hundreds of native and cross-platform applications across domains including audio processing, development tools, text editors, graphics software, productivity utilities, and system management tools. The applications span multiple programming languages including Swift, Objective-C, C/C++, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Rust, representing both native macOS development and cross-platform frameworks. The repository addresses the need for discoverable, free alternatives to commercial macOS software while promoting open-source contribution and collaboration. It targets macOS developers seeking reference implementations, users looking for free software alternatives, and contributors interested in open-source macOS application development, serving as both a software discovery platform and a gateway to macOS development learning resources.
