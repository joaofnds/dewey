Workspaces is a ClojureScript component development environment that provides isolated development and testing of UI components without requiring full application rendering. Built for web frontend developers working with ClojureScript applications, it offers a card-based interface inspired by Devcards where developers can create individual cards for components and tests, organize them into tabbed workspaces, and manage their layout and positioning. The tool integrates with modern ClojureScript build systems including Shadow-CLJS (with custom build target and auto-scanning capabilities) and Figwheel, supporting hot-reloading for live development workflows. It addresses the common frontend development challenge of component isolation and testing by enabling developers to work on individual UI pieces independently, view test results in-browser rather than terminal, and maintain organized development environments for complex ClojureScript applications.
