Keycast is an Emacs Lisp package that provides real-time display of executed commands and their corresponding key bindings within the Emacs text editor environment. It offers four distinct visualization modes: mode-line display at the bottom of windows, header-line display at the top, tab-bar integration for frame-level visibility, and a dedicated logging frame for command history tracking. Designed for Emacs power users, developers, and content creators who need to demonstrate or monitor their editor interactions, this tool addresses the common need for keystroke visualization during screen recordings, tutorials, or debugging complex key binding configurations. The package integrates directly with Emacs' internal command system and UI framework, leveraging native mode-line, header-line, and tab-bar APIs to provide non-intrusive real-time feedback about user interactions within the development environment.
