This GitHub Action serves as a wrapper for semantic-release, a tool that automates version management and package publishing based on conventional commit messages. Built in JavaScript and targeting the CI/CD domain, it enables developers to integrate semantic versioning workflows into GitHub Actions pipelines without manual setup. The action executes semantic-release within a Docker container, respects existing semantic-release configurations, and exports version information as both environment variables and step outputs for downstream workflow steps. It addresses the DevOps challenge of consistent, automated release management by eliminating manual version bumping and changelog generation. Primary users are JavaScript/Node.js developers and DevOps engineers implementing automated release pipelines, particularly those publishing NPM packages or managing GitHub releases with semantic versioning standards.
