`codfish/semantic-release-action` is a JavaScript-based GitHub Action designed to automate semantic versioning and release management within CI/CD pipelines. It provides a streamlined interface for running `semantic-release`, leveraging the existing configuration from a project's `.releaserc`, `release.config.js`, or `package.json`. Key functionalities include setting environment and output variables containing release version information for use in subsequent actions, such as publishing to registries or updating Docker images, and the ability to configure various semantic-release options through GitHub Action inputs. This project is a developer productivity tool, specifically a GitHub Action plugin, built for facilitating automated releases based on commit message conventions.
