FrankenPHP is a modern PHP application server written in Go that embeds PHP into the Caddy web server to provide enhanced performance and capabilities for PHP applications. Targeting web developers and DevOps engineers, it addresses PHP's traditional performance limitations through worker mode (persistent application state), Early Hints support (HTTP 103), automatic HTTPS/HTTP2/HTTP3, and real-time capabilities via Mercure. Built on Caddy's foundation, it functions both as a standalone binary and embeddable Go library using net/http, supporting popular PHP frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, and Drupal. The server enables creation of self-contained PHP applications and static binaries, solving deployment complexity while offering significant performance improvements over traditional PHP-FPM/Apache setups through persistent worker processes and modern HTTP protocol support.
