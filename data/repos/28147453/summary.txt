This repository serves as John Tromp's personal homepage and technical blog, built using static HTML and hosted on GitHub Pages. The site focuses on computer science, mathematics, and computational theory topics, featuring content such as cryptographic puzzles (illustrated through an "alien message" visualization using ASCII art), numerical computing concepts (exploring floating-point representation limits in 64-bit systems), and likely research publications or technical writings. The repository targets computer scientists, mathematicians, cryptographers, and researchers interested in theoretical computer science, algorithmic challenges, and mathematical computing. Using GitHub's native hosting capabilities, it demonstrates a minimalist approach to academic web presence without complex frameworks, relying on basic web technologies to present technical content and research materials to the academic and professional computing community.
