**age** is a modern file encryption tool and Go library designed for system administrators, security engineers, and developers who need simple, secure file encryption with UNIX-style composability. Built in Go, it implements the age encryption format specification (age-encryption.org/v1) using small explicit keys without configuration files or complex setup. The tool addresses the complexity and usability issues of traditional encryption tools like GPG by providing a minimalist CLI interface for encrypting/decrypting files and streams. It supports multiple recipient types including X25519 keys, SSH keys, and hardware tokens through plugins, making it suitable for DevOps workflows, backup encryption, and secure file transfer scenarios where simplicity and interoperability are prioritized over extensive feature sets.
