`wttr.in` is a console-oriented weather forecast service, enabling users to retrieve weather information through various interfaces. Built with Python, it leverages `curl`, HTTPie, or `wget` for terminal access, HTML for web browsers, and PNG for graphical viewers. Core functionalities include providing weather reports for specific locations, supporting multiple output formats including ANSI art, JSON, and Prometheus metrics, and offering customization options such as one-line output and map views. It relies on external dependencies like `wego` (written in Golang) for weather data retrieval, and utilizes libraries such as `Flask`, `geoip2`, and `requests`. This standalone application is primarily accessed via the command line and web interfaces.
