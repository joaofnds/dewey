TypeDI is a TypeScript library providing a dependency injection (DI) solution for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It enables constructor and property-based injection, supports singleton and transient services, and offers multiple DI container implementations. Key features include automatic instantiation and injection of dependencies using decorators, facilitating the creation of well-structured and testable applications. This library targets developers building applications in Node.js or the browser and is intended for enhancing code maintainability and testability through inversion of control principles.
