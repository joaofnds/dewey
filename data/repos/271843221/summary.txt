**visual-replace** is an Emacs Lisp package that provides an enhanced interactive interface for Emacs' built-in query-replace functionality, targeting Emacs users and developers who frequently perform text search-and-replace operations. The package offers real-time preview of matches and replacements, unified prompt interface showing both search pattern and replacement text simultaneously, navigation between matches using arrow keys, and selective replacement application through keyboard shortcuts or mouse clicks. It supports multiple replacement modes including string-replace, query-replace, replace-regexp, and query-replace-regexp, with configurable scope options (buffer, region, point-forward) and search modifiers (case-folding, whole-word, whitespace handling). The tool integrates seamlessly with existing Emacs workflows while maintaining compatibility with standard Emacs replacement commands, addressing the limitations of Emacs' traditional separate-step replacement interface for enhanced developer productivity in text editing tasks.
