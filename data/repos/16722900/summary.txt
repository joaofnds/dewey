IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a distributed peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to create a decentralized web infrastructure. It serves as a content-addressed, versioned file system that replaces traditional HTTP-based web architecture by using cryptographic hashes to identify and link data across a distributed network. The protocol leverages IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked Data) for data structures, multiformats for self-describing data formats, and implements content deduplication through merkle DAGs. IPFS targets web developers, distributed systems engineers, and blockchain developers building decentralized applications, content distribution networks, and censorship-resistant web services. It addresses problems of centralized data storage, broken links, and single points of failure in traditional web infrastructure by enabling permanent, decentralized data storage and retrieval without relying on central servers.
