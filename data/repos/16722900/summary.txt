IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed for decentralized data management. The project provides a foundation for content-addressed storage and retrieval, enabling users to build distributed applications and networks. Key functionalities include content addressing using IPLD, multi-format support, and p2p data transfer. This repository likely serves as the core implementation of the IPFS protocol and related utilities, targeting developers interested in building decentralized applications and content-addressed systems.
