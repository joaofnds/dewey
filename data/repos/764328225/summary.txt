Marker is a cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri and TypeScript that provides a graphical user interface for viewing and editing Markdown files. Targeting developers, technical writers, and documentation specialists in software development workflows, it addresses the need for a dedicated Markdown editor outside of IDEs or web-based solutions. The application leverages Tauri's Rust backend with a TypeScript frontend to deliver native desktop performance while maintaining web technology familiarity. It solves the common problem of efficiently managing Markdown documentation, README files, and technical notes through a standalone desktop environment, offering an alternative to browser-based editors or complex IDEs for users who primarily work with Markdown content in their development and documentation workflows.
