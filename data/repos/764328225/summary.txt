`Marker` is a desktop application designed for viewing and editing Markdown files. Built with Tauri, a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications, and leveraging TypeScript, it provides a user-friendly interface for Markdown content manipulation. Users can download pre-built installers or build the application locally, with options for installation using Homebrew and AUR for Arch Linux. The project is a standalone desktop application, targeting users who need to view and edit Markdown documents with a dedicated UI.
