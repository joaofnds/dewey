XTDB is an open-source immutable SQL database built in Clojure that provides comprehensive bitemporal querying capabilities for application development and data compliance. The system maintains complete audit trails by tracking both system time (when data was recorded) and valid time (when data was actually valid), enabling time-travel queries without snapshots or backups. It features a columnar Apache Arrow-based ACID engine optimized for object storage, supports both SQL:2011 standard queries and XTQL, and offers schemaless document storage with arbitrarily nested data structures. The database targets enterprise developers and data engineers requiring regulatory compliance, audit capabilities, and historical data analysis, providing HTAP (hybrid transactional/analytical processing) workloads through its separated storage and compute architecture with Postgres wire protocol compatibility.
