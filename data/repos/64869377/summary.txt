`need-for-type` is a Ruby-based terminal application designed as a typing race game inspired by Nitro Type and TypeRacer. Functionality centers around allowing users to race against each other or against the clock by typing provided text snippets within a terminal environment. It utilizes the `gem` packaging system for installation and distribution. This project is a standalone command-line application aimed at users interested in improving their typing speed or engaging in competitive typing.
