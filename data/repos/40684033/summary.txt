SOPS (Secrets OPerationS) is a cross-platform secrets management tool built in Go that encrypts structured configuration files containing sensitive data like API keys, passwords, and certificates. It supports multiple file formats (YAML, JSON, ENV, INI, binary) and integrates with enterprise key management services including AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, Azure Key Vault, along with PGP and age encryption. The tool operates transparently as an encrypted file editor, automatically handling encryption/decryption while preserving file structure and allowing selective encryption of specific values within configuration files. Primarily targeting DevOps engineers, platform engineers, and system administrators, SOPS addresses the critical problem of securely storing and versioning secrets in Infrastructure-as-Code workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and GitOps deployments while maintaining the ability to collaborate on configuration files through version control systems.
