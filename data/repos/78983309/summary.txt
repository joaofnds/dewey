Mitt is a minimal TypeScript-based event emitter library designed for web development environments, weighing only ~200 bytes when gzipped. It provides a functional pub-sub pattern implementation that serves as a lightweight alternative to Node.js EventEmitter for browser applications and JavaScript runtimes. The library offers core event handling functionality including on/off event registration, emit for triggering events, and wildcard (*) event listening for catching all events. Built with TypeScript for strong type safety, it supports both ES6 modules and CommonJS, targets IE9+ compatibility, and integrates seamlessly with modern build tools like Webpack and Rollup. Mitt addresses the need for micro-libraries in frontend development where bundle size optimization is critical, particularly useful for component communication in frameworks like Preact/React without adding significant overhead to the application bundle.
