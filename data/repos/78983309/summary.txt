`mitt` is a tiny, functional event emitter library written in TypeScript, designed for JavaScript runtimes, particularly for browser environments. Its core purpose is to provide a lightweight and efficient mechanism for pub/sub event handling, enabling developers to easily manage and respond to events within their applications. Key features include wildcard event listening using the `*` character and methods that avoid reliance on `this`. This project functions as a standalone library, offering event emission, registration, and removal capabilities for developers seeking a minimal dependency for event management in their JavaScript projects, including those using ES6 and CommonJS modules.
