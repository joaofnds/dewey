Frappe Charts is a lightweight JavaScript charting library designed for web developers who need responsive SVG-based data visualizations without external dependencies. Built with vanilla JavaScript and SVG rendering, it provides programmatic chart generation for web applications, supporting axis charts, bar/line graphs, pie charts, heatmaps, and mixed chart types. The library addresses the common web development challenge of integrating clean, GitHub-inspired charts into business applications without the complexity or bundle size overhead of heavyweight visualization frameworks like D3.js or Chart.js. It features dynamic data binding, customizable styling, annotations, and tooltip support, making it suitable for dashboard development, business intelligence interfaces, and data-driven web applications where simplicity and performance are prioritized over advanced statistical visualization capabilities.
