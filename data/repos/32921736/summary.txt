Audacity is a cross-platform, multi-track digital audio editor and recorder implemented in C++ using the wxWidgets GUI framework. Targeting the audio production and multimedia content creation domain, it provides waveform-based audio editing capabilities for recording, mixing, and processing audio files across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. The software addresses core audio engineering workflows including multi-track recording, real-time effects processing, spectral analysis, and audio format conversion. Licensed under GPLv2/v3, it serves audio engineers, podcasters, musicians, and content creators who require professional-grade audio editing tools without commercial licensing costs. The repository is currently undergoing major architectural changes for version 4.0, featuring complete UI redesign and significant codebase refactoring while maintaining backward compatibility with established audio processing pipelines.
